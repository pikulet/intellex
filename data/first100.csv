YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This case concerned a disposal inquiry in respect of three vehicles seized in the course of police investigations. During the inquiry, both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to possession of the vehicles. The district judge ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent. The petitioners filed a petition for the revision of the order made below. I dismissed the petition and now give my reasons.
 2.
 A preliminary point
There seemed no agreement in the court below between the parties involved on the question whether the inquiry was held pursuant to s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC) or s 392 of the CPC. In their submissions, the petitioners assumed s 386 of the CPC to be the applicable section. The respondent relied upon s 386 of the CPC on the first page of his written submissions but, later, in the same set of submissions, cited s 392 of the CPC as the applicable section. From the notes of evidence, the investigating officer appears to have thought the relevant section to be s `382` of the CPC. The district judge did not comment on which section he applied nor whether he acted in his capacity as a magistrate, as required by s 392 of the CPC, or as a district judge. During the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondent cited s 392 of the CPC as the relevant section while counsel for the petitioner did not mention which section of the CPC the case involved.
 3.The relevant section is s 392 of the CPC. This is because no prosecution was commenced after the police investigations. Accordingly, there has been no `inquiry or trial in any criminal court` within the meaning of s 386 of the CPC. Previously, in 
Magnum Finance Bhd v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
 , I stated, for the same reason, that this is the disposal provision to apply in cases where there has been no prosecution. No prejudice, however, has been occasioned by the confusion in the court below, as the inquiry only concerned the disposal of property between rival claimants and this discretion is similarly exercised under both sections. No power peculiar to s 386 of the CPC was involved. I therefore proceeded to deal with the petition on the footing that the inquiry had been held pursuant to s 392 of the CPC.
 4.
 The law in respect of disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC
Section 392(1) of the CPC is as follows: 
The seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate`s Court which shall make such order as it thinks fit respecting the delivery of the property to the person entitled to possession of it or, if that person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of the property.

 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP f 
Somewhat surprisingly, there is scant local precedent on the exercise of a magistrate`s discretion pursuant to s 392 of the CPC. 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, which I mentioned earlier, is a case which really concerned s 386 and dealt only with the question of when s 392 of the CPC is to apply. Nevertheless, some of the precedents on s 386(1) of the CPC, insofar as they deal purely with the distribution of property between rival claimants, would seem applicable to disposal inquiries held pursuant to s 392(1) of the CPC. Using this approach, the following principles appear to be relevant to a disposal inquiry conducted under s 392 of the CPC: (i). A disposal inquiry is intended to be an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items produced in the course of investigations or at trial: 
Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 414
 .
 (ii). Such an inquiry is not conclusive as to title. The rightful owner can and should assert his rights in a separate civil suit: .
 (iii). There is no right of appeal against an order made pursuant to a disposal inquiry: 
Sofjan & Anor v PP
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 272
 .
 (iv). Where there is a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice, the court may exercise its revisionary jurisdiction: .
 6.From the preceding paragraph, it is clear that while the perimeters of a magistrate`s discretion and the High Court`s powers have been delineated with precision, no rules have been set out in respect of situations where entitlement to possession is disputed. In this connection, counsel for the petitioners advocated the approach found in the Indian case of 
Purshottam Das v State
 
[1952] Cr LJ 856
. In dealing with a provision of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code similar to the section under discussion, Desai J stated at p 860: 
A magistrate is not a civil court and has no power to decide disputes about title. There was nothing in s 523 to authorise a magistrate to decide which party is the rightful owner of the property. His enquiry is limited to finding which person is entitled to possession. 
 Once he ascertains the person from whose possession the property is seized, he must hold him to be entitled to its possession unless his possession was unlawful
. [Emphasis added.]
 7.The first part of the extract is unremarkable and I have no quarrel with it. It is clear from the local precedents and indeed, s 392 itself, that the magistrate may not make binding decisions about title to property. Counsel for the petitioners, however, relied on the portion highlighted in italics to set out a simple three-point test: first, the magistrate should ascertain the possessor at the time of seizure; secondly, he should ascertain if such possession was unlawful; and thirdly, in the absence of unlawful possession, the property should be returned as a matter of course to the person in whose possession it was immediately prior to seizure by the police.
 8.I cannot agree that a magistrate must be constrained to such a simplistic approach. Suppose, for example, that X, who holds title, loans his property to Y for a day, who would then be in possession as a lawful licensee. At the end of the day, the property is seized from Y during police investigations, through no fault of X or Y. Although Y would be the party in possession at the time of seizure, Y could not possibly dispute that it is X who is entitled to possession. Although Desai J`s observation that the magistrate is unable to decide questions of title is a correct one, the mere inability to
 decide 
 questions as to title does not and cannot lead to an inability to 
 have regard 
to the party who holds title. Title and possession are related concepts. In many cases, the right to possession arises from the fact of having title. In other cases, although a party holds title, he may not, for various reasons, be the party entitled to possession: for instance, if he has leased his property to another for a period which has not expired.
 9.In my view, a magistrate having charge of a disposal inquiry cannot abdicate his responsibilities by applying the three-step 
 Purshottam Das 
 test. He must look to the facts of each case to ascertain the party who is entitled to possession. In some cases, entitlement to possession will be plain from the facts presented. In other cases, he may not be so fortunate. But even where such entitlement is not clear from the evidence, the magistrate still ought to deliver possession to the party to whom, after a consideration of the evidence, appears to him to be entitled to possession. In such cases, the magistrate is severely handicapped by the lack of pre-inquiry disclosure of documents and evidence. As a result, his judgment must, in a sense, be exercised in a somewhat `rough and ready` fashion. This may be justified by the object of disposal inquiries, which is to achieve an expeditious method of distributing items no longer relevant to police investigations or court proceedings. It should be noted, in this context, as it was in 
 Thai Chong Pawnshop Pte Ltd v Vankrisappan 
, that the magistrate`s ruling has no effect on a civil court, which is the correct forum in which to test complex issues of fact and law. In such cases, any party aggrieved ought to commence civil proceedings. A petition for revision is not the appropriate route. As I said in 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
, the High Court`s power of revision is only exercised where there has been a fundamental error occasioning a clear failure of justice. It was with these principles in mind that I considered the petition for revision.
 10.
 The disposal inquiry in the court below
This disposal inquiry concerned a car with registration number SBU 2462 (the Nissan); a pick-up truck with registration number GJ 4328 (the pick-up); and a van with registration number YF 2867Z (the van). The Nissan was owned by one Sim Cheng Khim (Sim) (the deceased) whilst the pick-up and the van were owned by Golden Horse Trading Pte Ltd (Golden Horse), a dormant company owned by Sim. The Nissan was transferred to Sim`s husband, one Lee Eng Soon (the respondent) and the other two vehicles were transferred to his company, Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex) between August and December 1994. On 2 March 1995, Sim lodged a police report alleging that her signature had been forged on the instruments of transfer. In the course of the ensuing police investigation, the vehicles were seized from the possession of the respondent. Meanwhile, on 8 August 1995, Sim died. In her will, she bequeathed all her property `whatsoever and wheresoever situate` to her trustees to hold on trust for her mother. The two petitioners are the executors of her estate.
 11.After 18 months, upon the completion of their investigation, the police decided not to prosecute the respondent. A disposal inquiry was convened to distribute the three vehicles and both the petitioners and the respondent claimed entitlement to the vehicles.
 12.During the disposal inquiry, the investigating officer, S/S/Sgt Robert Kau, produced the police report in which Sim contended that the respondent had forged her signature on the transfer form for all three vehicles. He testified that he had sent the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) for signature analysis. On cross-examination by counsel for the respondent, he revealed that the form for the Nissan had not been sent because Sim had informed him that that was `her transfer form`.
 13.Counsel for the petitioners sought to prove the estate`s claim by adducing three categories of evidence: first, evidence that Sim`s signatures had been forged without her knowledge; secondly, her statements to the same effect, particularly those made in a will dated 7 February 1995; and thirdly, evidence that her relationship with her husband was poor prior to her death.
 14.In order to show that Sim had no prior knowledge of the transfer, an officer from the company from which the vehicles had been hire-purchased, Jeffrey Lim, was called. He testified that Sim telephoned Wayfoong Mortgage & Finance (S) Pte Ltd in January 1995 to enquire about the outstanding account for the Nissan. When informed that the account had been settled by a cash payment and the vehicles had been released to the respondent, she expressed surprise and said `it can`t be settled`.
 15.To prove that the signatures were forged, the DSS officer was called. He testified both in respect of the report he gave the police, as well as a later report requested by the executors. In the first report made for the purposes of the police investigation, he compared the signatures on the transfer forms for the van and pick-up with Sim`s specimen signatures. In the second report for the executors, he compared the release letter given to Wayfoong Mortgage by the respondent with Sim`s specimen signatures. He testified that the maker of the specimen signatures was not the same person as the maker of the signatures on the release letter and transfer forms. On cross-examination, he stated that illness could affect a person`s signature, but was of the view that none of the signatures exhibited was made by a person with terminal illness because the muscle control was still sound. He was of the opinion that the transfer form and release letter signatures were stiff and heavy, which could be the result of someone trying to imitate another`s handwriting. He was unable to conclude, however, that the respondent was responsible for the forgery. Owing to the fact that the specimen signature provided by the respondent was in Chinese, there was no basis for comparing the Chinese signature with the forged signatures.
 16.The second main area of the executors` evidence centred on the will dated 7 February 1995. By her will, Sim bequeathed all her property to her mother. At para 5, she explained her omission to provide for her husband in the following terms: 
I declare that my reason for making no provision in this my will for my husband Lee Eng Soon @ Lee Son is that there is no longer any husband-wife relationship between us since he fraudulently forged my signature and transferred my car to himself and also transferred my property Blk 7 #11-11 Melville Park Singapore to his mother without my prior approval.
 The solicitors who were responsible for drafting the will were called as witnesses. Jupiter Kong, former solicitor for Sim while he was at Lee & Lee, stated that the word `car` in para 5 ought to have been in the plural, because he was initially instructed in respect of the unlawful transfer of ownership of three cars and an apartment. On the other hand, Stacey Ong, who was responsible for drafting the will, testified that she had read the will to Sim on the telephone and Sim had confirmed that the will reflected her intentions.
 17.Both petitioners and a social worker named Cathy Lim were called to testify in respect of Sim`s complaints against the respondent. However, most of the questions asked were disallowed on the ground of hearsay and nothing of substance was adduced from these witnesses.
 18.The respondent, for his part, relied on the following four facts: that the police decided not to charge him with any offence; that he was and is the holder of the legal title; that he was in possession immediately prior to the seizure of the vehicles; and that all three vehicles were paid for by Jean Tex Trading Pte Ltd (Jean Tex), a company he now owns.
 19.The respondent`s evidence was that he married Sim in 1992. From sometime in 1990 until July 1994, he was an undischarged bankrupt. Both the pick-up and the van, he said, were purchased prior to his marriage. The pick-up was held in the name of Jean Tex, which was then owned by one Lee Jee Kok, and the van was owned by his mother. The pick-up was transferred, without fee, to Sim`s dormant company, Golden Horse, sometime in 1992 when Jean Tex was in financial trouble. The van was transferred to Golden Horse in 1992 also, again without fee, because his mother was `getting old`. The Nissan was purchased in Sim`s name in 1992, but he contended that Jean Tex paid for its purchase. Sim did not possess a driving licence. At all times, the three vehicles were used for the purposes and in the possession of Jean Tex. He became the proprietor of Jean Tex on 10 October 1994, after the annulment of his bankruptcy. He testified that Sim agreed to transfer the vehicles to him in late 1994, and furnished him with her identity card for this purpose. She signed the transfer forms and release letter in hospital, while he was out buying her lunch.
 20.At the end of the inquiry, the magistrate ordered that the vehicles be delivered to the respondent.
 21.
 The petition for revision
Counsel for the petitioners raised three main grounds for revision: first, that the magistrate had given insufficient attention to the DSS reports that Sim`s signatures had been forged; secondly, that insufficient emphasis had been placed on Sim`s statements in her will and to witnesses that the respondent had caused the unlawful transfer of the vehicles to himself; and lastly, as a related submission to the second ground, that the magistrate had erred in refusing to admit statements made by Sim to others about her relationship with the respondent and the respondent`s role in the transfer of her vehicles.
 22.In my view, the evidence in respect of the forged signatures was the most significant issue raised in the petition. Both in the court below and before me, counsel for the respondent made much of the fact that no prosecution has been brought against the respondent. This, in my opinion, was irrelevant. If the transfer forms had been forged, regardless of who had forged them or how they had been forged, it would appear that the title to the vehicles would have remained with Sim and, on her death, passed to her estate. Nevertheless, as a result of the aborted investigations, there has been no finding of fact in any court of competent jurisdiction that the transfer forms were indeed forged. For this reason, I looked very carefully at the evidence adduced to prove the forgeries. Unfortunately, I found the evidence unsatisfactory in several respects. On this point, the petitioners` case hinged on the DSS reports. The initial DSS report, however, only dealt with the transfer forms for the pick-up and the van. The Nissan form was excluded because, on S/S/Sgt Kau`s evidence, Sim had informed him that it was `her transfer form`. The omission of evidence on the Nissan transfer form was a serious lacuna in the petitioners` case. In an attempt to remedy the loophole, counsel for the petitioners then requested that the third form be sent as well. Owing to objections made by counsel for the respondent on the grounds that the magistrate had no power to order the further analysis, the magistrate refused the application. Nevertheless, on 23 April 1997, after the close of the respondent`s case, when the magistrate adjourned the hearing to 6 June 1997 for written submissions, he gave the petitioners leave to subpoena the DSS officer, if they thought fit. The DSS officer was called as a witness on 7 June 1997. It was at this hearing that he tendered his second report, dated 16 May 1997. In the report, he compared the signature on the Wayfoong Mortgage release form, which the respondent had tendered to obtain possession of the Nissan, with Sim`s specimen signature and concluded that the makers of both signatures were different. Again, no evidence as to the signature on the Nissan transfer form was led.
 23.In addition, there appeared to be some inconsistency in Sim`s various comments on the issue of the documents being forged. Although she reported to the police, the executors and Jupiter Kong that all three vehicles had been transferred without her authority, she informed S/S/Sgt Robert Kau that the transfer form for the Nissan was `her transfer form`. Moreover, para 5 of her will, drafted by Stacey Ong upon her specific instructions, referred only to `car` in the singular.
 24.This case was further complicated by both sides` treatment of the respondent`s evidence, through the production of cheque stubs and receipts, that Jean Tex had funded the initial purchase of the vehicles. Counsel for the respondent laid emphasis on this fact, but as I pointed out at the hearing, the log-book of a vehicle is its index of title: the funding of the purchases, without more, could not be a reason to deliver possession of the vehicles to the respondent. The respondent 
 could 
 have argued, based on such funding, that a resulting trust existed in his favour and that Sim, even prior to the transfers of title, was only a `bare trustee` with none of the benefits of ownership; that the respondent as the beneficial owner would have been entitled, at any point, to have asked for possession, and indeed, the transfer of the bare legal title to himself: see 
Saunders v Vautier
 
[1841] Cr & Ph 240
. This he did not do. His omission was complicated by the fact that this type of resulting trust is merely a presumption of intention which may be contradicted by evidence that the parties intended the contrary. Of relevance in the present case was the fact that Sim was the respondent`s wife and, as such, a `presumption of advancement` could be applicable to show that the husband intended the cars to be gifts: see 
Tinker v Tinker
 
[1970] 1 All ER 540
. This point was not taken by counsel for the petitioners either. In consequence, no evidence was led by either side as to the intent of the parties. For the petitioners, their omission may have arisen because Sim had informed them that she had paid for the cars and that her bag of documents was missing. Prior to the hearing, too, they were unaware of the respondent`s cheque stubs and receipts. As for counsel for the respondent, his omission may have arisen, in part, from his misplaced reliance on 
 Purshottam Das v State 
.
 25.From the preceding paragraphs, it would appear that there was a tremendous conflict of evidence which remained unresolved after the proceedings in the court below. No doubt some of the confusion may have been occasioned by the informal nature of a disposal inquiry and the ancillary lack of procedure for the proper discovery or inspection of documents found in civil and criminal proceedings. Be that as it may, I was not persuaded to exercise my revisionary jurisdiction, as it cannot, in the circumstances, be said that the magistrate`s decision resulted in a clear failure of justice. The respondent was the holder of the legal title and was in possession prior to the seizure. If the police had not seized the vehicles, the petitioners would have had the onus of commencing a claim in conversion and of proving the forgery. In order to prove that claim, proper discovery of documents would be necessary, the DSS reports would be perused in advance by the respondent, who would then be entitled to call his own expert to contest the allegations made. The respondent`s evidence as to payment would also be properly tested and any arguments in respect of a resulting trust or gift would be canvassed properly before the court. The magistrate`s order was merely a return to status quo and the petitioners are not constrained by this order in subsequent civil proceedings. Conversely, if the magistrate had ordered the delivery of the vehicles to the respondent, his order would have been limited to possession only. If it could be shown that notwithstanding the respondent`s legal title, he was plainly not entitled to possession, then mere possession would have sufficed for the petitioners` purposes. It was obvious from the evidence, however, that this was not the situation at hand.
 26.In my judgment, this case highlighted the inadequacy of a disposal inquiry as a forum to adjudicate complex issues of civil law. In such inquiries, there are no proper procedures for all pertinent issues to be set out and for evidence to be discovered and contested in an orderly fashion. This arises, no doubt, from their purpose, which is merely to distribute items no longer relevant to pending police investigations or criminal proceedings. Where it is plain from the facts and law which party ought to obtain possession, a magistrate`s failure to exercise his discretion correctly could be taken to be a fundamental error. Where entitlement to possession is complex, on the other hand, the magistrate must, by force of circumstances, do justice between the parties in a somewhat `rough and ready` manner. In such cases, canvassing the same issues again on a petition for revision is inappropriate.
 27.In the present case, upon receipt of information that the police were not proceeding with charges against the respondent, the petitioners ought to have commenced civil proceedings against the respondent for conversion immediately. If those proceedings had finished prior to the disposal inquiry and the petitioners had been adjudged the rightful owners, then it would have been a fundamental error for the magistrate to have ignored that finding. Even if those proceedings had not been completed prior to the disposal inquiry, several avenues would still have been open to the petitioners to allow them to protect their interest. First, they could have persuaded the magistrate to release the vehicles to the respondents on a bond to return them if the civil court should find favourably for the petitioners. This is an approach suggested by the Malaysian courts where an appeal is pending: 
PP v Peh Choo Key
 [1970] MLJ 136 . Alternatively, they could have persuaded the magistrate to retain the vehicles or their proceeds in the custody of the court, subject to any order of the civil court. This is the approach advocated by several Indian authorities: 
 Ramphal 
 40 CWN 862, 
 Ram Khalawan 
 28 CWN 1094, 
 Visa Samta 
 16 Cr LJ 111. I should mention that, in two of these cases, the order appears to have been made regardless of whether a civil suit was actually pending. This approach is not recommended, for, if no civil suit is commenced, the order would be of an uncertain duration. In any event, these possibilities were moot in the present case, because no civil proceedings were in fact afoot.",1997-10-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

 The appellant was tried and convicted in the magistrate court on the following charge: 
You
 
Tan Lay Wah, F/34 yrs
 
NRIC NO: 1620089A
 
are charged that you, on 31 January 1997 at about 10.31pm at NTUC Fairprice, Blk 451 Clementi Avenue 3 #01-307, Singapore, being employed in the capacity of a servant, to wit, a groceries supervisor, did commit theft of ten cans of `New Moon` abalone, each valued at $32.80, with a total value of $328, in the possession of the manager, Tan Chin Chye, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 Section 381 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) states: 
Whoever being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall also be liable to a fine.
 The appellant was convicted and sentenced to four weeks` imprisonment. She appealed against her conviction and sentence. I heard her appeal on 21 April 1998 and I allowed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 2.
 The case for the prosecution
The prosecution`s case was as follows. On the morning of 31 January 1997, Nancy Tee, a supervisor at the Clementi branch of NTUC Fairprice (NTUC), told Basuri bin Rosidi (Basuri), the security officer of NTUC, that there were some cans of abalone inside a Foster beer box under the appellant`s table in the office. Nancy Tee instructed Basuri to keep an eye on the abalone. During the day, Basuri went into the office at half-hourly or hourly intervals to check the box.
 3.Sometime after 6pm on 31 January 1997, Lee Swee Siong (Lee), a deaf mute storehand in the grocery department of NTUC, saw the appellant taking ten cans of abalone and two cans of shark`s fin. He identified the cans in exh P3, a photograph of the abalone cans, as the cans he saw. Lee saw the appellant place the cans in a Guinness box and move the box under the table. He then walked over to Goh Ah Keok (Goh), a supervisor of NTUC, to sign to her what was happening. At about 6.10pm, Goh saw the appellant put the cans of abalone into two Royal biscuits tins. The tins were those featured in exh P2, a photograph of the abalone cans in biscuit tins. The appellant sealed both tins with scotch tape. After sealing the tins, the appellant put them into her plastic bag.
 4.At 10.30pm that day, Basuri checked the appellant as she was leaving. She was carrying two plastic bags, each with a Royal biscuits tin in it. The appellant showed Basuri the receipt for the two tins of Royal biscuits. Basuri returned the receipt and the appellant left.
 5.Nancy Tee checked the Foster box with the abalone cans a total of four times that day. Sometime after 10pm, she checked the Foster box and discovered that the cans were missing. The abalone cans which were missing were of the type shown in P3. She then informed Basuri that the abalone cans were missing. After checking two people who were leaving, Basuri ran out to look for the appellant.
 6.Basuri found the appellant at Clementi Bus Interchange ten minutes later. He informed her that he needed to re-check her biscuit tins. She asked `Why`. He replied that a few cans of abalone were missing. She gave him one of the tins. He checked and found abalone cans inside. The appellant did not say anything. Basuri asked her to follow him back to the store. She initially refused but agreed when Basuri said she might be able to speak to the branch manager and he might give her a chance.
 7.Once back at the office, Basuri handed over the appellant and the biscuit tins to NT Lingam (Lingam), the security manager of NTUC. Basuri then called Tan Chin Chye (Tan), the manager of NTUC, to inform him about the matter. He also asked P Mohd s/o P Ahmad (Ahmad), the security supervisor of NTUC, to call the police.
 8.Inside the manager`s office, the abalone cans were taken out of the biscuit tins. The abalone cans Lingam and Tan saw were those shown in P3. Tan also confirmed that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone similar to exh D4, an abalone can white and blue in colour.
 9.The appellant was escorted back to the station at about 11.23pm. The ten cans of abalone and two empty biscuit tins were seized as exhibits. These exhibits were subsequently handed over to Sergeant Tho Yeng Kok (Sgt Tho), the investigating officer. Sgt Tho asked Jumato bin Saad (Jumato) to photograph the exhibits. This resulted in exhs P2-P4. Sgt Tho returned the ten cans of abalone to Basuri on 3 February 1997. Sgt Tho proceeded to record the long statement from the appellant at about 1.10am on 2 February 1997. Woman Corporal Tan Siok Hoon was present at that recording. In the statement, the appellant admitted to the theft of the abalone cans.
 10.
 The case for the defence
The defence`s case was as follows. The appellant reported for work on 31 January 1997 at 2.24pm. Sometime after 5pm she left for dinner. She returned some time after 6pm. She bought her biscuit tins during her dinner break. According to the receipt they were bought at 6.35pm. She subsequently brought the biscuit tins back to the office and placed them under her table. Her evidence was that she could not remember whether there was anything underneath her table. She denied putting the abalone cans into the biscuit tins. She left work at 10.31pm.
 11.At Clementi bus interchange, Basuri stopped her, checked her biscuit tins and asked her to follow him back to the office. The appellant testified that the abalone cans that were taken out of the biscuit tins were blue and white cans similar to some specimens in court, D4. The appellant`s evidence was that abalone was one of the items under her charge and that abalone of the type similar to D4 was never sold in the supermarket. Only the type similar to another specimen D5, an abalone can chilli red in colour, and another specimen D2, an abalone can pink and blue in colour, were sold.
 12.The appellant denied stealing the abalone cans from NTUC. Her defence was that someone planted the cans in her biscuit tins to frame her.
 13.The appellant was not on good terms with some of the prosecution`s material witnesses, namely Lee, Basuri and Nancy Tee. Her relationship with Lee was poor because she had to scold him on occasions when he made mistakes. Her relationship with Basuri deteriorated after an argument over closing door shutters, and she had an argument with Nancy Tee over one of the appellant`s storehands.
 14.The appellant denied that her statement was made voluntarily. According to her, she was not allowed to visit the washroom during the three hour interview in the police station, even though she was suffering then from menstrual pains. She said that Sgt Tho threatened her with seven years` imprisonment and a fine if she did not sign the statement. Her evidence was that Sgt Tho offered to let her off with a warning and a fine if she signed the statement. She testified that she did not read the contents of the statement. After her release, she told her sister and brother-in-law about the incident. She testified that she attempted to contact Sgt Tho several times to correct what she signed but he refused to see her. She eventually made a police report on 8 May 1997, admitted as D6. A day before she was formally charged in court, she made a second police report.
 15.
 The magistrate`s findings
The appellant made several allegations of threats and inducement. The magistrate conducted a voir dire. After considering all the evidence, the magistrate was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been given voluntarily and was not brought about by any threat, inducement or promise. The statement was admitted as PS2.
 16.One of the issues in contention was whether the abalone cans in question were those sold by NTUC. The actual cans had been returned to NTUC. The only evidence the prosecution had of the allegedly stolen cans were exhibit photographs P2 and P3. The defence`s contention was that the cans shown in P3 were white and blue, and that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour type of abalone cans. Tan and the appellant had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans. In cross-examination, Jumato was referred to P2 and questioned as to the colour of the cans. He answered that they were white and blue and further confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to the blue and white type of D4.
 17.The magistrate made a finding of fact that the cans of abalone in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC and not of the type similar to the blue and white D4.
 18.
 The appeal
The crux of the appeal was this. Were the abalone cans in question of the type sold by NTUC? The appellant and Tan, the manager of NTUC, had testified that NTUC did not sell the white and blue colour abalone cans. They only sold the red cans, and the pink and blue cans. The only evidence the prosecution had regarding the allegedly stolen cans were photographs P2 and P3, the actual cans having been returned on 3 February 1997. In cross-examination, Jumato, the police photographer, testified that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue and confirmed that the cans in P2 were similar to those in D4. It was also conceded by the counsel for the prosecution that the cans in P2 and P3 appeared more white than pink. Examining P2 and P3, I was also of the opinion that the cans in P2 and P3 were white and blue in colour and not pink and blue.
 19.The prosecution submitted that the magistrate`s finding was supported by the appellant`s statement to the police, in which she admitted that the abalone seized from her belonged to the management of the supermarket. The prosecution also submitted that the magistrate`s finding that the abalone cans in P2 and P3 were sold by NTUC was reinforced by the fact that the appellant did not, at any stage before the trial, protest that the abalone seized from her did not belong to the supermarket. In effect the prosecution tried to prove that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, by relying on evidence from the appellant`s statement and on a single strand of circumstantial evidence arising from the appellant`s behaviour. I am of the view, however, that such evidence is contradicted by other evidence tendered by the prosecution themselves, namely the photographs P2 and P3 of white and blue abalone cans, the evidence of Jumato that the cans in P2 and P3 were white, and the evidence from Tan himself that NTUC did not sell the white and blue type of abalone cans.
 20.The totality of the evidence in this case was clearly that the cans in question in P2 and P3 were white and blue and of the type not sold by NTUC. In my judgment, the magistrate erred with respect to a material finding of fact when she found that the cans in P2 and P3 were the pink and blue type sold by NTUC.
 21.There was therefore no proof that the abalone cans were in the possession of Tan, the manager of NTUC. As a result the charge against the appellant was not made out. It is settled law that the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution`s case is that set out in 
Haw Tua Tau v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  [1980-1981] SLR 73 . At the end of the prosecution`s case the judge must consider whether 
 there is some evidence (not inherent incredible) which, if he were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding that `no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction `
 22.In this case, the prosecution failed to establish an essential element of the offence, in that they failed to establish that the abalone cans were in the possession of the appellant`s master. Accordingly the defence should not have been called.
 23.For these reasons, the appeal against conviction was allowed.",1998-04-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

 2.
 Facts
The appellant was involved in an accident on 2 January 1996 at about 12am, at the junction of Yishun Avenues 5 and 2. He was in the process of negotiating a right turn into Yishun Avenue 2 from Yishun Avenue 5 when a motorcycle travelling along Yishun Avenue 2 collided into the rear left door of the appellant`s car. The appellant drove on without stopping. The motorcyclist and the pillion rider sustained fractured limbs and were taken to hospital.
 3.The accused was later arrested and his blood was found to contain 149mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. He pleaded guilty to the following charges under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed): 
(a) Driving under the influence of drink under s 67(1); and 
(b) Failing to render assistance to persons injured in an accident under s 84(3).
 The following charges were taken into consideration: 
(a) Failing to stop a vehicle in an accident under s 84(1); and 
(b) Moving a vehicle involved in an accident under s 84(4).
 He was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment and ten years` disqualification from driving and fined $800. On appeal to the High Court, the sentence of one month`s imprisonment was set aside and a fine of $5,000 was imposed.
 4.In March 1997, the witnesses to the accident were interviewed on the local television program `Code Red`. The matter was then referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) by the Television Corporation of Singapore.
 
 The prosecution`s case
Ng Geok Hock (PW1)
 5.Ng testified that he was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. After the appellant had completed the turn into Yishun Avenue 2, the appellant slowed down before picking up speed again and driving off. When Ng saw the appellant driving off, he followed the appellant`s car. The appellant turned into a side road with a no entry sign. Ng followed him. The appellant then turned right into the Yishun bus interchange. Ng flashed the headlights of his taxi and sounded his horn to try to get the appellant to stop. When the appellant was close to the exit of the interchange, Ng drove alongside the appellant`s car. The appellant then stopped. Ng parked his taxi in front of the appellant`s car to prevent him from driving off. Both drivers alighted from their vehicles.
 6.Ng asked the appellant in a mixture of English and Hokkien why he had `hit and run`. The appellant replied, `No` and said that he wanted to give Ng money to let him go. By this time, Ng had already called the police on his handphone and reported the matter. He therefore told the appellant that he had already called the police and was waiting for their arrival. Under cross-examination, he admitted that he could not remember the exact words of the conversation. But he was adamant that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that this offer had been made two or three times. He was also adamant that the appellant had made the offer before he had told the appellant that he had already called the police.
 7.Ong (PW2) and Susan Goh (PW4) then arrived on the scene. He overheard part of the conversation between Susan Goh and the appellant. Susan Goh asked the appellant why he had not stopped after knocking somebody down and had instead run away. The appellant then offered her money if she let him go. Susan said that she did not want his money.
 Ong Siong San (PW2)
 8.Ong was driving his taxi along Yishun Avenue 5 when he witnessed the accident. He drove after the appellant`s car. He followed him into the side road with the no entry sign all the way into the interchange. He parked his taxi behind the appellant`s car. He saw the appellant and Ng talking but could not hear their conversation. He asked the appellant if he was trying to run away after knocking somebody down. The appellant replied that he did not know what had happened and that he was not trying to run away. Ong then asked him why he had ignored the no entry sign if he was not trying to run away. The appellant remained silent. Susan Goh then arrived. Ong then went back to the scene of the accident. When he returned to the interchange, he saw Ng and Susan Goh scolding the appellant. He heard them say that the appellant had knocked somebody down, failed to stop and was still trying to run away. He also heard them say, `Your money very big.` Susan Goh then told him that the appellant had offered them money to let him go. Ong became very angry and scolded the appellant for trying to escape after knocking down somebody. Ong also said, `Your money is so big. Two lives are involved.`
 9.Under cross-examination, Ong said that when they were scolding the appellant, his 
 impression 
 was that he told them to let him go. It was also his 
 impression 
 that Ng had already reported the matter to the police. Under further cross-examination, Ong said that the appellant 
 had 
asked them to let him go home. Ong later clarified this, saying that the appellant 
 had 
 pleaded with them to let him go. Under re-examination, Ong further claified this, saying that the appellant 
 was 
 trying to tell them to let him off. None of this was in Ong`s evidence-in-chief.
 10.At this point counsel for the defence applied to recall Ng so as to put to Ng that he, similarly, merely had an 
 impression 
 that the appellant was asking Ng to let him go. Counsel for the prosecution objected on the ground that Ng had already been cross-examined extensively on whether the appellant had asked Ng to let him go. The trial judge agreed and refused the application.
 Susan Goh Soon Bee (PW4)
 11.Susan Goh was in a car driven by her sister Goh Quek Bee (Goh) (PW3) when she witnessed the accident. When the appellant failed to stop, she ran after his car to try and record the appellant`s registration plate number. She arrived at the interchange to find the appellant talking to two taxi drivers, Ng and Ong. She said that one of the taxi drivers had asked the appellant why he had failed to stop after knocking down somebody. The appellant asked him not to report the matter to the police. The taxi driver said that the matter must be reported. The appellant then offered them money in return for not reporting the matter to the police. Under cross-examination, Susan Ong was adamant as to what the appellant had said as well as to the sequence of the conversation. The appellant had asked them not to report him to the police and that he would give them all money if they all let him go. The taxi driver had then told the appellant that he had already reported the matter.
 12.The appellant then spoke to Susan Goh alone and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers on his behalf. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer.
 Goh Guek Bee (PW3)
 13.Goh was driving her car with Susan Goh beside her when she witnessed the accident. Susan had got out and run after the appellant`s car. When Susan returned, she was very angry and told her how the appellant had offered them money to let him go and how the appellant had approached her to reason with the taxi drivers on his behalf.
 The appellant`s statements
 14.The appellant viewed a recording of the program `Code Red` before making a statement under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Ed). The material parts of the statement are as follows: 
3 On that night, after I realised that I hit an object at the junction of Yishun Ave 2 & 5, I turned to Yishun Bus Interchange and stop there. Soon I realised that there were two taxi drivers parked in front and back of my vehicle. They started scolding me for not stopping after hitting the motorcycle. Later, one lady join them. The lady was very angry and aggressive. At that moment, I thought that the lady was related to the motorcyclist. 
4 I was in a state of shock and panic after they told me that I had hit a motorcycle. I pleaded with them not to report to the police. I remember clearly that I told them to `talk about it` first before reporting to the police. What I meant was that if they demanded money I would give it to them. One of the taxi drivers told me that he had already reported to the police. In the process of pleading with them, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go. I did not remember how much I was going to give them to let me go. I cannot remember how actually I phrased the sentence. I was in the lost and I did not know what I was saying. 
5 I wish to say I do not normally behave that way. I was not in the right frame of mind after the accident. I was also very high at that time after consumption of alcohol.
 15.In his cautioned statements to the two charges, the appellant simply said that he would like to consult his lawyer.
 16.
 The defence
The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He testified that he had heard a thud sound coming from the rear of his car when he was turning right into Yishun Avenue 2. He slowed down momentarily and glanced at his rear view mirror and also took a half glance to the rear, but saw nothing. Nonetheless, he wanted to stop the car to see if any damage had been done to the car. He had turned into the side road so that he could stop the car. He had not seen the no entry sign. He was intending to stop the car when he saw a vehicle behind him flashing its headlights. He thought he was obstructing the vehicle and so he drove on. When the vehicle came alongside his car and sounded its horn, he immediately stopped the car and got out. The driver of the vehicle, whom he identified as Ng, also alighted.
 17.Ng asked him why he had not stopped after hitting a motorcycle. The appellant was shocked at the accusation as he had not realised he had hit a motorcycle. But Ng insisted that he had done so and that he had reported the matter to the police. The appellant asked Ng why he had reported the matter to the police when the appellant had not seen any such accident. If indeed there was such an accident, he should go and render assistance. However, Ng insisted that he stay put.
 18.Another vehicle then drew up behind his car. The driver, whom he identified as Ong, alighted and accused the appellant of running away after hitting a motorcycle. There followed a stream of such accusations from Ng and Ong.
 19.He next heard a woman, whom he identified as Susan Goh, screaming loudly and gesticulating wildly. He thought that she was one of the accident victims. He apologised to her and offered her money as compensation. He was however not sure whether he had actually used the word `compensation`. He asked her how much she needed. He also told her not to call the police as he thought that it was only a minor accident. Susan Goh was very angry and rejected his offer, saying, `You think your money so big.`
 20.The appellant then realised that Susan might not be one of the victims of the accident. The appellant claimed that one of the prosecution witnesses had mentioned that two people had been injured in the accident. He then asked Susan Goh to discuss with `them` how much they wanted. He explained that by `them`, he meant the accident victims, and he had emphasised this by gesticulating towards the scene of the accident.
 21.As regards his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the appellant claimed that at the time the statement was recorded, he had been unable to recall what had happened at the bus interchange. When asked by his counsel why he had stated `in the process of pleading, I might have told them that I would offer them money if they could let me go`, he said that the witnesses had been very convincing on the program `Code Red` when they accused him of offering them money to let him go, so much so that he had begun to doubt himself. As such, he had taken a conciliatory stance even though he did not believe that he would bribe anyone. However, once he had heard the witnesses give evidence during the trial that he had said, `Let me go, I give you money`, he stopped doubting himself and was convinced that he had not tried to bribe them. As for his cautioned statements, he said that he had been shocked and his first reaction was to consult a lawyer. He was also afraid that he would say the wrong things in his statements.
 22.
 Decision below
The trial judge examined the photographs of the damage done to the appellant`s car and found that the appellant must have been aware of the collision with the motorcycle. Further, the appellant`s conduct after the collision had taken place showed that he had been aware of the collision. The trial judge went on to weigh the evidence of the prosecution witnesses against that of the appellant. The trial judge noted that the appellant had conceded in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money in return for being let off. The trial judge also drew an adverse inference against the appellant for failing to mention the material particulars of his defence in his cautioned statements. In the result, the trial judge accepted the evidence of Ng, Ong and Susan Goh and disbelieved the appellant`s defence. The trial judge accordingly convicted the appellant on both charges and imposed a fine of $15,000 in respect of each charge.
 23.
 The appeal
The appellant appealed only against his convictions and not against his sentences. On appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the following issues: (a). the trial judge`s findings of fact;
 (b). her refusal to allow counsel for the defence to recall Ng;
 (c). the drawing of an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68); and
 . whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.
 24.It is useful at this stage to reiterate the principles governing an appellate court`s role in reviewing the trial judge`s findings of fact. It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial judge`s findings of fact, especially where they hinge on the trial judge`s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence. This is borne out by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which states that no judgment, sentence or order of a district court or magistrate`s court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. In 
Lim Ah Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 713
 , FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, held at p 719: 
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor.
 Similarly, in the case of 
Tan Chow Soo v Ratna Ammal
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 49
 , in which findings of fact depended on the credibility and veracity of witnesses, Lord Diplock, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, held that an appellate court should be reluctant to overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the witnesses in full and observing their demeanour. The upshot of these cases is that factual findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be lightly disturbed in the absence of good reasons. Then again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual findings which have been ascertained, a different approach will be taken. In such cases, it is again trite law that an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary inferences of fact from the circumstances of the case. With these principles in mind, we turn to the appeal proper.
 25.
 Whether the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident at the time the offer of money was made
The appellant`s first contention was that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had been aware of the accident and had attempted to run away from the scene of the accident.
 26.The trial judge relied heavily on (a) the damage to the appellant`s car and (b) the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the accident.
 27.The trial judge found that the damage to the rear door of the appellant`s car was so extensive that it was inconceivable that the appellant could have been unaware of the collision with the motorcycle. In response, the appellant contended that (a) his car was an extremely heavy vehicle, being a Mercedes S300, (b) the car radio was on and (c) he was intoxicated at the time and so the collision had not been apparent to him. He had merely heard a thud. After examining the photographs of the damage to the appellant`s car, I was of the view that the appellant must have been aware of the collision. The entire rear door had caved in, and judging by the fact that both the riders of the motorcycle had been flung off in the collision and suffered multiple fractures, the impact must have been substantial enough to capture the appellant`s attention. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had looked back and seen nothing. This was rejected by the trial judge and she was, in my view, fully justified in doing so.
 28.The trial judge also found that the appellant`s behaviour immediately after the collision showed that he was aware of the accident and was trying to run away. The appellant had driven into a side road despite the presence of a no entry sign and had continued driving into the Yishun bus interchange. He had driven to the end of the interchange and had only stopped when Ng drew alongside him in his taxi. The appellant explained in his evidence-in-chief that, having heard a thud, he had wanted to stop the car to check if his car had been damaged. He had not seen the no entry sign. The reason why he had stopped only when Ng had drawn alongside him was because Ng had been flashing his headlights at him and he thought he was obstructing Ng`s way. The appellant`s explanations were rejected by the trial judge. She found that the appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a person trying to run from an accident scene. In particular, she noted that the appellant could not have been obstructing Ng`s way as the bus interchange was extremely wide with plenty of room to overtake. I agreed with the trial judge`s findings. The appellant`s actions were explicable only as those of a confused and panic-stricken person trying to run from the scene of an accident. If he had merely heard a thud, as he claimed he did, he must have thought that the damage, if any, to his car would be minor. Why then would he take the trouble to ignore a no entry sign and turn into a bus interchange to stop the car to check for damage?
 29.In any case, the essential element to be established was that the appellant knew that he had been involved in an accident 
 at the time 
 the alleged offer of money to the prosecution witnesses took place, the purpose of which was to induce the witnesses to let him go so that he could escape the consequences of being involved in the accident. Ng testified that he had accused the appellant of running away after colliding with a motorcycle 
 before 
 the offer of money had taken place. Ong had also levelled the same accusation at the appellant. The appellant claimed in his evidence-in-chief that he had not believed their accusations. Yet he had failed to take the simple step of checking his car for damage to satisfy himself that he had not been involved in such an accident. The appellant later said in his evidence-in-chief that he had initially thought that Susan Goh was of the victims of the accident. In other words, the appellant had come to accept that he had been involved in an accident with a motorcycle. Therefore, even if the appellant had not been aware of the accident before his encounter with Ng, Ong and Susan Go at the bus interchange, the appellant must nonetheless have been aware of the accident at the time the offer of money was made.
 30.
 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Ng
The trial judge found that Ng had consistently maintained that the appellant had offered him money to let him go and that the offer had been repeated two or three times. On the other hand, the trial judge found that the appellant had taken four inconsistent positions as to whether he had offered money to Ng.
 31.The appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in so finding. I was unable to accept the appellant`s contention. The appellant had first stated in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act that he might have made an offer of money. Later, he recanted and explained that he had been swayed by the witnesses` account of events on the program `Code Red` and that he was now sure that he had not made such an offer. When asked in cross-examination whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant said that he could not recall. Yet, under re-examination, when asked again whether he had made an offer of money to Ng, the appellant claimed that he had not done so. In my judgment, the trial judge was fully justified in finding that the appellant`s answers were inconsistent and unsatisfactory.
 32.The appellant next contended that the trial judge had attached insufficient weight to the inconsistencies in Ng`s evidence. In particular, during Ng`s examination-in-chief, he had stated that the appellant had replied, `No` when he had accused him of running away after knocking down a motorcycle, whereas under cross-examination he had said that he could not recall if the appellant had denied being involved in the accident. The short answer to this is that the discrepancy was an immaterial one which did not detract from the general veracity of Ng`s evidence. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to treat the discrepancy as trivial and to ignore it: 
Chean Siong Guan v PP
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 63
 . As this court noted in 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
  at p 579: 
Adequate allowance must be accorded to human fallibility in retention and recollection. It is also common to find varying accounts of the same incident by the same person. No one can describe the same thing exactly over and over again.
 33.The appellant next contended that when he had asked Ng to let him go, he had only wanted to be allowed to go the scene of the accident. The trial judge had rejected the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. She noted that the evidence of Ng and Susan Goh that the appellant had not asked to return to the scene of the accident was unchallenged. In fact, Susan Goh had asked the appellant to return to the scene of the accident, only to be told by the appellant that there was no need to do so as the accident was not a serious one. The appellant claimed to have used the words `let me go to render assistance`. However, none of the other witnesses testified that they had heard him use the words `render assistance`, and this was never put to them in cross-examination. In my view, the trial judge was fully justified in rejecting the appellant`s construction of the words `let me go`. If the appellant had truly wanted to return to the scene of the accident, he could have made his intentions much clearer and asked Ng or any of the other witnesses to accompany him back to the scene of the accident.
 34.
 Whether the trial judge erred in refusing to recall Ng
The appellant next contended that the trial judge should have allowed the defence to recall Ng so that he could be cross-examined as to whether his evidence was that the appellant had 
 in fact 
 offered him money, or was it merely his 
 impression 
 that the appellant had offered him money. The trial judge refused the application on the ground that Ng had already been extensively cross-examined on the issue and had maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money.
 35.The court has a discretionary power to recall a witness if the evidence of the witness appears to the court essential to the just decision of the case: s 399 Criminal Procedure Code. In my judgment, the trial judge exercised her discretion correctly in refusing to recall Ng. Ng had already been cross-examined repeatedly on the issue in question and maintained throughout that the appellant had in fact offered him money. It would be fruitless to recall him only for him to give the same evidence all over again. Ng would in effect be simply re-stating his evidence, and this has been held to be highly irregular and recognised as a valid ground for refusing to recall a witness:

 Whether the appellant had offered a gratification to Susan Goh
Susan Goh testified that the appellant had offered money to Ng, Ong and herself to let him go and not report the matter to the police. She also testified that the appellant had later approached her and asked her to speak to the other taxi drivers. He told her that he would give all of them money if they let him off. Under cross-examination, she was adamant that the offer of money had been made to all three of them and not to her alone, and that the appellant had gesticulated in the direction of the two taxi drivers when making the offer. The appellant on the other hand claimed that he had thought that Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident and he had therefore offered money to her as compensation. When he realised that she was not in fact one of the victims, he had approached her to negotiate with the accident victims on his behalf, and had gesticulated in the direction of the accident scene to emphasise his point.
 37.The trial judge rejected the appellant`s version of events. I found that the trial judge was perfectly justified in doing so. If the appellant had truly thought that Susan Goh was one of the accident victims, one would have thought that he would be extremely apologetic and would ask about her condition and if anyone else was hurt. Yet the appellant had failed to do so. As for the appellant asking Susan Goh to negotiate on his behalf, it seems to me incredible that the appellant should ask a complete stranger who was obviously hostile towards him to negotiate on his behalf. Moreover, at this point in time, he had no inkling as to the seriousness of the accident and the extent of the injuries suffered by the accident victims. It would have made far more sense for him to ask the witnesses to accompany him to the scene of the accident so that he could assess the situation and deal directly with the victims. Further, he had not mentioned this aspect of his defence in his cautioned statements or in his statement recorded under s 27 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant for his failure to mention these facts.
 38.
 Whether an adverse inference should have been drawn under s 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code
The appellant contended that the trial judge should not have drawn an adverse inference from his failure to raise the material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements. His explanation was that he had wished to consult a lawyer first and did not want to say the `wrong things`. I found this explanation to be completely unacceptable. The whole purpose of s 123 is to compel the accused to outline the main aspects of his defence immediately upon being charged so as to guard against the accused raising defences at trial which are merely afterthoughts. If the accused is allowed to escape the consequences of s 123 simply by explaining that he had wished to consult a lawyer first before saying anything, s 123 would be rendered otiose. I would emphasise at this point that it is not in every case that an adverse inference is drawn against an accused who keeps silent upon being charged. An adverse inference will be drawn only if he fails to mention facts which he could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged. In the instant case, the appellant had failed to mention in his cautioned statement that he had thought Susan Goh was one of the victims of the accident, that he had offered her compensation and that he had later asked her to negotiate with the victims of the accident on his behalf. It must have been evident to the appellant, even without the benefit of consultation with a lawyer, that these facts afforded a legitimate explanation for the offers of money he allegedly made, and that it would be in his interest to mention them. These were thus facts which the appellant could reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged, and the trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 for failing to mention these material aspects of his defence in his cautioned statements.
 39.
 Language barrier
The appellant contended that he had spoken to the prosecution witnesses in a mixture of Hokkien and English and that he might have been misunderstood as he was not fluent in Hokkien. However, the appellant had himself conceded under cross-examination that he did not think the prosecution witnesses had misunderstood him. The prosecution witnesses were adamant as to what the appellant had said to them, and it was never put to them in cross-examination that they might have misunderstood the appellant because of linguistic difficulties. The trial judge was fully justified in finding that there had been no misunderstanding despite the appellant`s lack of proficiency in Hokkien.
 40.
 Whether the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose
Finally, the appellant contended that the offer of money was not for a corrupt purpose within the meaning given to offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. I found this contention to be utterly without merit. It is well established that the word `corruptly` inserted within s 5(b)(i) of the Prevention of Corruption Act qualifies the offence in a significant manner. There must be a corrupt element in the transaction itself, and the offer of the gratification must be accompanied by a corrupt intent: 
PP v Khoo Yong Hak
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 283
 . As to the first limb, whether a transaction had a corrupt element is an objective inquiry based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. This question is to be answered only after the court has inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction. In determining whether the transaction had a corrupt element according to the ordinary and objective standard, it is useful to keep in view the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `corrupt` as a working guide, albeit with the qualification that this is not exhaustive: 
Chan Wing Seng v PP
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 426
 . For present purposes, it suffices to note that one of the meanings of `corrupt` as defined in 
 The Oxford English Dictionary 
 is: 
To destroy or pervert the integrity or fidelity of (a person) in his discharge of duty; to induce to act dishonestly or unfaithfully; to make venal; to bribe.
 41.In the instant case, the appellant had intended to escape criminal liability in exchange for money. Such a transaction is clearly corrupt based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. Firstly, it is in substance a transaction in the nature of a bribe. Secondly, it is akin to an attempt to subvert the course of justice; the appellant clearly believed that he could bargain with the witnesses to his criminal acts and buy their co-operation if he was willing to pay the right price. In short, the appellant had sought to attach a monetary value to the witnesses` integrity and sense of justice. For these reasons, I had no hesitation in finding that the offer of money was for a corrupt purpose.
 42.

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant, a corporation, was convicted after a trial for carrying on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd (BUPA), which was an insurer not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, an offence under s 33(1) Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed). It was fined a total of $22,000. The appellant appealed against the conviction and sentence. The only issues on appeal were: (1) whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent carrying on insurance business in Singapore for BUPA; and (2) whether the prohibition in s 33(1) Insurance Act is only limited to policies relating to risks in Singapore. After hearing the submissions, I dismissed the appeal and now set out my grounds.
 2.The charge was as follows: 
You, International Testing Co Pte Ltd Registration no: 199404857Z are charged that you, between October 1994 and March 1996, without the approval of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, did carry on insurance business in Singapore as insurance agent for British United Provident Association Ltd, which was an insurer not entitled to carry on insurance business in Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 33(1) of the Insurance Act (Cap 142, 1994 Ed).
 3.
 The facts
The facts were simple and were agreed by the appellant. The whole of the prosecution case rested on the agreed facts. The appellant is a private limited company engaged in the business of consultant engineering services and general insurance. BUPA is an insurer based in the United Kingdom which offers health care insurance coverage. At the material times, BUPA was not registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore under s 3 of the Insurance Act, and it was prohibited from carrying on any class of insurance business in Singapore. At the material times, Rosaline Margaret Yap Gim Leng (Rosaline Yap) and John William Wilson were the directors and shareholders of the appellant. Rosaline Yap was in charge of the general insurance business division in the company.
 4.Between October 1994 and March 1996, the appellant arranged for BUPA policies to be issued to: (1) PT Comismar Wanamaja (Comismar), a company incorporated in Indonesia; (2) David Quodling (Quodling), an Australian based in Malaysia.
 5.
 Comismar
In a letter dated 24 August 1994, the appellant informed BUPA that it was organising the health care insurance of the management and consultancy personnel of Comismar and conveyed information on Comismar. On 26 August 1994, BUPA replied and it was followed by an exchange of correspondence between BUPA and the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent a letter to BUPA, enclosing the agreement duly signed by BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. BUPA acknowledged receipt of the forms.
 6.
 Quodling
On 31 October 1995, the appellant, at the request of Quodling, sent to him literature on health insurance plans offered by BUPA and ProMedico, an insurer, and the application forms for both insurers. In the letter, the appellant asked Quodling to return the application form duly completed so that the application `could be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On 15 December 1995, the appellant forwarded to BUPA the application form completed by Quodling and the premium paid by Quodling. On 9 January 1996, the appellant informed Quodling that his application to BUPA had been accepted. The appellant further informed Quodling that the insurance cover had commenced on 1 January 1996 and that relevant documents would be despatched to him once the appellant received them. Subsequently the appellant received the membership certificate issued by BUPA for Quodling and in turn sent the certificate to Quodling.
 7.
 The defence
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the defence counsel argued that there was no case to answer. Section 33(1) of the Insurance Act only covered `Singapore policies` under First Schedule para 2(1) or offshore polices issued in Singapore under para 2(2), read with s 2(5) of the Act. The policies in respect of which the appellant was charged were policies issued by foreign issuers not in Singapore. Alternatively, even if s 33(1) applied to the insurance policies in question, the appellant had not committed any offence as it had not carried on insurance business as an agent for an insurer; it had not received proposals for polices, issued policies or received premiums on policies under s 2(5). It merely acted as a post-box to transmit information from BUPA. The district judge rejected the defence submission of no case to answer. He called upon the appellant to enter its defence. The appellant elected not to give evidence. The district judge convicted the appellant on the grounds that the appellant did in fact carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent under s 2(5). Further s 33(1) was not restricted only to `Singapore policies`.
 
 The appeal
Whether the appellant was acting as an insurance agent for BUPA within s 33(1) Insurance Act
 8.Section 33(1) prohibits the carrying on by insurance agents of insurance business in Singapore for an insurer not registered with MAS. BUPA, in response to queries from the Commercial Affairs Department in its investigations against the appellant, replied that the appellant `did not operate as a tied agent for BUPA International in Singapore but as an independent intermediary`. Counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant was not acting as an insurance agent for BUPA but as a postbox. I paid very little regard to BUPA`s claims that the appellant was not an insurance agent acting on its behalf. Rather the court should examine whether, having regard to the policy behind legislation and the course of conduct of the appellant, it was acting as an insurance agent within the meaning of s 33(1) read with s 2(5).
 9.The policy behind the Act is to regulate and supervise the conduct of insurance business in Singapore. The Act draws a distinction between an insurance agent and an insurance broker: see ss 2(5) and 33. However, the definition in s 2(5) is unhelpful as it merely provides that a Singapore insurance broker means a person who is or has been carrying on business as an insurance broker in Singapore. Section 33(2) provides inter alia that a Singapore insurance broker shall only negotiate a contract of insurance with a Singapore insurer acting in the course of his business as such; the penalty for violating this provision is a maximum fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding a year.
 10.In my view, an insurance agent in s 2(5) is one who is acting as an agent of the insurer in negotiating, servicing or effecting insurance contracts whilst an insurance broker is an intermediary who is independent of any one insurer, and is generally an agent of the insured. In insurance law, the term insurance broker is understood to be one who is independent of and does not act for a designated insurer: Lewis E Davids, 
 Dictionary of Insurance 
, p 11 and 38; Clarke, 
 Law of Insurance Contracts 
 (3rd Ed, 1997) p 189. This is fortified by an examination of s 33. A heavier penalty is provided for an insurance agent carrying on business for an unauthorised insurer than for an insurance broker who negotiates a contract with an unauthorised insurer. An insurance agent within s 2(5) is one that acts on behalf of the insurer and is perceived by the legislature as being more culpable. Of course this does not mean that an insurance agent necessarily acts on the insurer`s behalf the whole of the time and he may in limited circumstances also act for the insured. In such a case, he will still be considered to be acting as an insurance agent under s 2(5). To hold otherwise would make the provisions of the regulatory legislation unworkable.
 11.Counsel argued that, since the appellant sent insurance brochures to Quodling of insurance proposals relating not only to BUPA but also to another insurer named ProMedico, the appellant was acting on behalf of Quodling. This was an untenable argument. The appellant did not hold itself out to act in the insured`s interest as would be expected of a broker acting on behalf of the insured in negotiating insurance contracts. There was no reason why the appellant could not be acting as an insurance agent for both BUPA and another insurer.
 12.In my view, the correspondence in the exhibits showed that the appellant was acting as an agent of the insurer. On the facts it was likely that the people carrying on business for the appellant company had no idea whether it was acting as an agent or as a broker when it was conducting business for clients, but, as I have pointed out earlier, the court had to determine whether the course of conduct undertaken by the appellant showed that it was acting as an agent or as a broker. The appellant did not hold himself out as an insurance broker when it was doing business and it was not registered as an insurance broker. The commission was paid by BUPA to the appellant at a rate of 10% on the introduction of new business and 10% on its renewal, not by the proposed insured. The appellant had authority from BUPA to receive proposals and forward them to BUPA for approval, and to communicate the explanation of the various terms found in the proposals to the proposed insured. In these circumstances, there was no doubt that the appellant was an insurance agent acting for BUPA.
 Scope of s 33(1) read with s 2(5) - Is the prohibition in s 33 read with s 2(5) confined to Singapore policies only?
 13.For ease of convenience, I set out the relevant provisions: 
33(1) No person shall, without the approval of the Authority
 , carry on insurance business in Singapore 
 as insurance agent for an insurer not entitled under this Act to carry on the business in question in Singapore; and a person contravening this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000 increased by a sum not exceeding $1,000 for every day on which he is proved to have done so, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. 
2(5) For the purpose of this Act, `Singapore insurer` and `Singapore insurance agent` mean a person who is or has been carrying on insurance business in Singapore as insurer and as insurance agent respectively, and `Singapore insurance broker` means a person who is or has been carrying on business as insurance broker in Singapore; and 
 references to carrying on insurance, or any class of insurance business, in Singapore include but include only the receipt of proposals for, or issuing of, policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance polices 
.
 
First Schedule - Definition of Insurance Terms
 
2(1) Subject to this paragraph and section 15(30 and (4) of the Act, `Singapore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means a policy issued in the 
 course of the insurer`s business in Singapore and 
falling within one of the following descriptions:
 
(a) a life policy or personal accident policy in the case of which, at the date of issue of the policy and (if the policy was issued before then) at the date of the establishment of the insurer`s register of Singapore policies, the policy owner`s address is or was an address in Singapore; 
(b) in relation to direct general insurance (other than personal accident policies) and facultative general reinsurance, a policy in the case of which the risk arises in Singapore or where the insured is a person resident in Singapore or is a permanent establishment in Singapore; and 
 
 
(2) `Offshore policy`, in relation to any insurer, means any policy other than a Singapore policy, issued in the course of the insurer`s business in Singapore.
 14.The prosecution argued that s 2(5) read with s 33 are not confined only to Singapore policies but cover all offshore insurance policies as well. Counsel for the appellant argued that the provisions must be read with para 2 First Schedule which defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy`. The two policies in question were not `Singapore policies` as the insured were not persons with a address in Singapore or resident in Singapore or were a permanent establishment in Singapore or in respect of risks that arose in Singapore. He argued that BUPA did not issue Singapore policies nor cause offshore policies to be issued in Singapore; the policies were UK policies issued in the UK.
 15.I now address the first argument that s 33 is limited only to Singapore policies. This argument is clearly without any merit. Section 2(8) provides that the definitions set out in the First Schedule shall have effect for the construction of references to policies of insurance, policy owners and policy moneys. However on the plain reading of s 2(5), there is nothing which indicates that it applies only to Singapore policies. The First Schedule defines `Singapore policy` and `offshore policy` but these terms are not found in s 2(5) nor in s 33. I am unable to see how reference to the First Schedule provides any assistance. The three categories in s 2(5) refer to receipt of proposals for issuing of policies in Singapore or the collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on `
 insurance policies 
`, and not only Singapore policies. There is no reason why the definitions in para 2 of the First Schedule should apply to s 2(5) or s 33.
 16.Also, as the district judge pointed out, it is anomalous to read a limitation to s 33. Under s 15(1) read with the First Schedule, a registered person or body has to keep a register of all `Singapore policies` and offshore policies issued in Singapore, both of which have to be issued in Singapore. It cannot be that on one hand a registered and authorised insurer has to keep registers of both Singapore and offshore policies and yet, on another hand, one can carry on insurance business in Singapore as an insurance agent with respect to offshore (but not Singapore) policies for an unauthorised user. It must be that the prohibition extends to carrying on insurance business with respect to all policies as insurance agent for all unauthorised and unregistered insurers.
 17.Counsel for the appellant had relied on the Preamble which provided that the Act was enacted to regulate insurance business in Singapore, and it could not have been intended to regulate foreign policies. With respect, the Preamble is inconclusive. There is nothing anomalous about the plain reading of ss 2(5) and 33. The Act does not regulate the carrying on of all insurance business, only the carrying on of insurance business 
 in Singapore as defined in s 2(5) 
.
 18.I am fortified by an examination of the legislative history. In 1986, s 2(5) was amended by deleting the words `Singapore policies` to replace them with the words `insurance policies`. It is clear that `insurance policies` in s 2(5) must refer to all insurance policies and not only to Singapore policies as defined in the First Schedule.
 19.The second argument raised by counsel was that even if s 33 covered offshore policies, the insurance policies were issued in the UK, and did not fall within s 2(5). I shall first consider the policy in relation to Quodling. This turns on the interpretation of the word `issuing` in s 2(5). `Policy` is defined in para 1 of the First Schedule to the Act, as including any contract of insurance whether or not embodied in or evidenced by an instrument in the form of a policy.
 20.`Issue` is not defined in the Act. The prosecution relied on 
Koon Wing Lau v Calwell
 
[1949] 
80 CLR 533
 which held that `to issue` meant that the document had to pass from the possession of the authorities either into his manual custody or under his control or into his legal possession so as to be at his command. The district judge accepted the interpretation that, for the insurance policy to be issued to a person, there had to be physical delivery of the document into the custody of the recipient or under his control.
 21.
 Koon Wing Lau v Calwell 
 was dealing with a case under the amended Australian Immigration Act 1949. The Act provided that a certificate of exemption `issued` by an authorised officer, to a prohibited immigrant or an immigrant required to pass a dictation test within a certain period, was deemed to be valid. When such a certificate was issued, he was not subject to provisions of the Act restricting entry into or stay in Australia. The importance of the certificate of exemption was that, if the certificate expired or was subsequently cancelled (on the stipulated grounds), he would be declared a prohibited immigrant and might be deported. The High Court of Australia held that the certificate was only `issued` within the 1949 Act if the certificate was delivered to the person named in the certificate. In that case, the High Court of Australia was dealing with the status of immigration of persons who could be deported. There was no doubt that, on such matters affecting his right to stay in Australia, the immigrant had to be informed as to whether he was allowed to remain in Australia. If the certificate was only signed by the authorities informing the immigrant and the certificate subsequently expired, he was liable to be deported. Hence it was justifiable to hold that the certificate had to be delivered to the immigrant.
 22.Here, we were concerned with a very different matter, viz. the issuing of insurance policies. The meaning of `issuing` in s 2(5) has to be construed not in the abstract but with reference to the use of the term in insurance law. An insurance contract is concluded when the duly completed proposal form is accepted by the insurers. Acceptance has to be communicated to the insured party. However, intimation by the insurer that the insured`s offer has been accepted can be in the form of the issuance of a policy to the insured: Tan Lee Meng, 
 Law of Insurance 
 (2nd Ed, 1997) at p 25. For the policy to be issued to the insured, there is no requirement that the policy must be both executed and delivered to the insured. Once the policy is executed to the insured, the policy is binding on both parties. This is illustrated in 
Roberts v Security Co Ltd
 
[1897] 1 QB 111
. In that case, a proposal for an insurance of goods against loss by burglary was made by the plaintiff to the defendant insurance company. The insurance company affixed the seal of the company to the policy which was in conformity to the proposal and the policy was duly signed. However, the policy remained in the hands of the insurance company and was not yet delivered when the loss occasioned by burglary occurred. The Court of Appeal held that the policy constituted a complete contract of insurance; the proposal was accepted when the policy was executed under the seal of the company.
 23.In this case, it was BUPA which had issued the policy of insurance to Quodling. The appellant sent a letter dated 9 January 1996 informing him that his application to BUPA had been accepted and the policy would be despatched to him once the appellant received it. This showed that it was BUPA which had executed the insurance policy in the United Kingdom and then delivered it to the appellant as agent in Singapore. By executing the policy, the policy was `issued` in the United Kingdom. The delivery of the policy was not necessary to constitute `issuing` within s 2(5). As such I disagreed with the district judge who found that the policy to Quodling was issued by the appellant in Singapore.
 24.However, the prohibition in s 2(5) is not confined only to the issuing of insurance policies in Singapore. There are two other categories in s 2(5): (1) receipt of proposals for policies in Singapore and (2) collection or receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies.
 25.There was no doubt that the proposal for the insurance policy was received in Singapore. `Proposal` is not defined in the Act. The district judge accepted the meaning as, where there was a proposal form issued by the insurer, the proposal was the form which had been duly completed by the insured; and where there was no proposal form, the proposal was a document which could be construed as an offer made by the proposed insured to the insurer which, if accepted by the insurer, constituted a binding contract between the proposed insured and the insurer. I agreed with this interpretation of the word `proposal`.
 26.On 31 October 1995. Quodling received a BUPA application form from the appellant to be duly completed by himself. The appellant asked Quodling to return to it the completed forms so that they `may be handled and approval sought from the respective underwriters`. On an examination of the application form, it was indeed a proposal form which, when duly filled in and signed by the proposed assured and forwarded to the insurers, would operate as a formal offer by the proposed assured to the insurers. The duly completed form was received by the appellant who then forwarded it to BUPA on 15 December 1995. There was no doubt that the appellant had authority from BUPA to receive the proposal from the proposed insured, though it might not have authority to enter into the insurance contract on BUPA`s behalf. Hence there was receipt by the appellant on behalf of BUPA.
 27.It was doubtful whether there was receipt in Singapore of premiums on insurance policies. The appellant forwarded the duly completed application form together with 
 a bank draft drawn in pounds made in BUPA`s favour 
 for the first premium. Counsel for the defence argued that there was no receipt of moneys in Singapore as the premium took the form of a bank draft made to BUPA`s order for onward transmission. Receipt of the premiums only took place when the bank draft made in BUPA`s favour was delivered to BUPA. The appellant did not receive the premiums in Singapore. The appellant had authority to receive the bank draft and to transmit it to BUPA but it was essentially acting only as a conduit in this respect. Hence I found that there was no receipt of premiums in Singapore.
 28.In relation to Comismar, there was receipt by the appellant of BUPA`s proposal in Singapore. The agreement was signed on 13 September 1994 and it was sent to the appellant. On 3 October 1994, the appellant sent to BUPA a letter enclosing an agreement duly signed by both Comismar and BUPA and the duly completed enrolment forms of five employees of Comismar. The insurance agreement was contained in the agreement duly signed by both parties.
 29.The result was that the conviction of the appellant should be upheld, but not on all the grounds relied on by the district judge. I found that the offence under s 33(1) of the Act was contravened on two occasions; the first was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Quodling was received in Singapore on 15 December 1995 and the second was when the proposal for the insurance policy in relation to Comismar was received in Singapore on 3 October 1994. Both proposals were received by the appellant as BUPA`s agent for onward transmission to BUPA.
 30.
 Sentence
The offence under s 33(1) of the Act is punishable with up to $20,000 fine increased by up to $1,000 for every day on which the offender is proved to have continued the offence, or up to two years imprisonment or to both. The district judge sentenced the appellant to an $18,000 fine, increased by a sum of $1,000 for every day of the four days it contravened s 33(1). With respect, I was of the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The appellant had contravened s 33(1) in relation only to two insurance policies relating to two different clients. The offence stretched from October 1994 to March 1996 but the appellant`s carrying on insurance business in Singapore was limited only to receiving proposals from the proposed insured and forwarding them to BUPA. The insured`s interest was not shown to be affected nor was the operation over such a prolonged period. It was not carrying on a large scale insurance business for BUPA. It was the appellant`s first conviction. I accepted that the appellant did not know that its manner of carrying on business contravened s 33. The public interest was not adversely affected. In the circumstances the fine should be reduced to $10,000. Given my earlier finding that the offence was committed only on the receipt of Quodling`s proposal in Singapore, as well as the receipt of Comismar`s proposals in Singapore, the contravention of s 33(1) took place only on two occasions, as opposed to the four occasions found by the district judge. Accordingly the sentence was reduced to a $10,000 fine increased by a sum of $1,000 for each of the two days the appellant violated s 33(1), making a total sentence of $12,000. The appeal against the sentence was allowed to this extent.",1998-07-21 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 This appeal is against conviction and sentence of six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for a conviction of an offence under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 2.
 The charge
The appellant was charged with possession of an offensive weapon as follows: 
You, Lee Cher Chiang, NRIC/PP No S7703059-Z are charged that you, on or about 6 June 1997, at or about 11.20pm, at Blk 3 Geylang Serai, Singapore, which is a public place did have in your possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife with a blade measuring 30cm, otherwise than with lawful authority or for lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 3.
 The facts
On the 6 June 1997 at about 11.33pm a police message was received by the Geylang Police Station from their Division Operation Room to attend to a case of four or five people, race unknown, fighting at the void deck of Blk 2 Geylang Serai, and running towards Joo Chiat carrying some sticks. Two police constables, Loo Chin Huat (Loo) and Ahmad Zaki bin Samsuri (Ahmad) went to the scene and saw four men at the ground floor of Blk 3 Geylang Serai. Two of the men were holding a stick each while the third man had a knife and the last a parang. Upon seeing the policemen, three of the men threw down their weapons and ran away. The fourth man placed his parang on the ground and tried to walk away. When Loo and Ahmad shouted at him to stop, he stopped and surrendered himself. They arrested him and seized the two sticks, parang and knife. This man was later identified as Sie Kok Choon (Sie).
 4.A while later, another patrol car (CR 13 ) and a group of plain-clothes Voluntary Special Constabulary (VSC) came to their assistance. One of the crew members from CR 13 found a bag about 10m away at the grass verge near the main road which contained yet another knife. The VSC came back about 15 to 30 minutes later with three male Chinese. These three men were the appellant, Sie Kok Chye (Kok Chye) and Vincent Ang Choon Keong (Vincent). Loo and Ahmad were unable to identify any of these three men as the ones who had fled as their backs were turned when they did so. Furthermore, Loo and Ahmad were still in the patrol car at that time. However, they could see that the person who threw down the knife was a male Chinese.
 5.Loo also testified that the scene was brightly lit by the corridor lights of the Housing and Development Board flats where the shops were. He did not chase after the three men who had fled because their back-up had not arrived then. In addition, as Sie was not yet handcuffed at that time, he could not leave his partner, Ahmad, to handle Sie alone.
 6.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution led evidence from Sie that he, together with Lucas Lim Chong Lin (Lucas), Vincent and the appellant had a fight with some other people earlier on the night of 6 June 1997. Sie testified that he then went home at Blk 11 Haig Road and put two knives and a parang into a bag while the rest waited at the ground floor below. He said that he had told them that he wanted to get a knife. They then went to Blk 3 Geylang Serai where he took the parang from the bag while the appellant took the knife. He was together with the appellant at that time but did not notice where the other two went. They then walked to the back entrance of the coffee shop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai with the appellant ahead of him. While they were still in the corridor, he saw the appellant suddenly place the knife on the floor and walk away very fast. He next saw the police car arrive and a policeman shouted at him. He was then arrested. He had only known the appellant for a year and had never had any quarrel with him.
 7.During cross-examination Sie corrected himself. He said that it was actually only Lucas who was involved in the earlier fight. When Lucas came to tell him about it later, Vincent and the appellant were present. His explanation for this contradiction with the evidence in his examination-in-chief was that he did not want to mention Lucas`s name as he had not been arrested. He said that Lucas told him that there were seven to eight persons in the other group comprising Malays and Chinese who assaulted him and there were wounds on Lucas`s head. After Lucas complained to him, he told those present, including the appellant, that he would go home to get knives.
 8.He also said that his brother Kok Chye was not present at that time. He had only met him at home and he did not see him packing the knives or go with him to Geylang Serai. However, when asked by his brother, Sie did tell him that he was going to Geylang Serai.
 9.Kok Chye`s evidence was that when he went home on the night in question, he saw the appellant, Vincent and Lucas at his void deck. Lucas, who was bleeding from his head told him that he had been assaulted. He then told Lucas that he would talk to the group and asked them to wait for him while he went home to change first. When he reached home, he saw Sie carrying a bag. He did not know what was in the bag. When he asked Sie what the problem was, he said that it was a quarrel and left. By the time he went downstairs, Sie and the rest were gone. He then went to the coffee shop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai. There he met a friend of his, one `Ah Hock`, who worked as a helper at the coffeeshop but there was no sign of Sie, the appellant or any of the others. He asked Ah Hock about the fight earlier and Ah Hock pointed out a group of male Malays and Chinese sitting at a table where the fight had taken place earlier. When he approached them, they smashed a beer bottle. He told them to remain calm and chided them for assaulting a small boy like Lucas. They replied that it was Lucas who assaulted them first and they were only retaliating. Kok Chye then demanded that they return the bicycle which they had taken from Lucas. They then threw the key of the bicycle to him and told him to collect it in the back lane. Later, he saw Lucas and handed the key to him. He told Lucas to collect his bicycle and return home to attend to his head injuries. Lucas then left.
 10.Subsequently two uniformed policemen arrived at the coffeeshop and approached the group of Malays. He could not hear their conversation. The policemen then approached him and asked him if he was aware that there had been a fight. He replied in the negative. On the advice of the policemen, Kok Chye left the premises. On his way home, he saw Vincent and the appellant near the coffee shop at the traffic light near Geylang Serai and walked with them. Along Joo Chiat Road, he was stopped by a police car and four plain-clothes policemen searched him and brought him back to the coffeeshop at Blk 3 Geylang Serai. The plain-clothes policemen asked the two uniformed policemen present whether he was the culprit and they replied in the negative.
 11.
 The defence
The appellant`s version of the events on the night of 6 June 1997 was essentially that he was never in possession of the knife. He testified that on the night in question he, along with Vincent and Kok Chye, was with Sie and three or four other persons whom he did not know. Sie told him that he had some matter at Geylang Serai and `pestered` him to go with him. Sie stopped off at home first and returned with the bag. Sie then took out a knife from the bag. The appellant was very surprised and turned and left.
 12.On cross-examination, the appellant said that when he was with Sie, Vincent and Kok Chye, Lucas approached Sie and spoke to him alone. Sie then told them that there was some matter at Geylang Serai and asked them to follow him. They stopped at his house first. When he came down he was carrying a bag. He showed them a knife from the bag on the way to Blk 3 and the three of them walked away. Along the way to Blk 3 they had met three or four of Sie`s friends. He was later checked by the police with Kok Chye and Vincent.
 13.Clearly the case for the defence was that it was Sie`s other three or four friends who were seen by Loo and Ahmad to be in possession of the knife and not the appellant.
 14.
 The trial judge`s decision
The trial judge below stated that the issues in the case were as follows: a. whether the appellant was in possession of the knife `P11` at the material time; and
 b. whether there was lawful authority or a lawful purpose for his possession of the knife.
 15.The trial judge also stated that the burden of proof on the issue of possession of the knife lay on the prosecution. However, the wording of s 6(2) clearly placed the burden of proving that the possession of the weapon was with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose lay on the accused. The trial judge cited 
PP v Muniandy
 
[1963] MLJ 147
 as authority for this proposition.
 16.After reviewing all the relevant evidence, the trial judge rejected the appellant`s evidence in favour of Sie`s and found that the appellant was indeed in possession of the knife and could not show that there was lawful authority or a lawful purpose for his possession. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
 17.
 The appeal
This appeal turned essentially on the simple question: whose evidence was to be believed? On the one hand there was the evidence of Sie that the appellant was the person that Loo and Ahmad saw putting down the knife and running away. Although Sie was an accomplice, and in the old days that would affect the probative value of his evidence significantly, it is now trite law that under s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Ed) a judge need not warn himself before accepting the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. He need only `scrutinize and weigh carefully` the weight of the uncorroborated accomplice evidence before acting upon it ( 
Ramachandran v PP
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 267
  
[1991] SLR 26
 ).
 18.On the other hand, there was the evidence of the appellant. The problem with his evidence was that there were contradictions in the most important aspect of it, ie the existence of the three or four friends of Sie that the appellant did not know. The most crucial part of the appellant`s defence was that it was not himself, Vincent and Kok Chye that Loo and Ahmad saw but rather these three or four other persons. However, his evidence was inconsistent on this very issue. First, he said in examination-in-chief that he met with these three or four persons before Sie showed him the knife, and he walked part of the way to Geylang Serai with his friends alone, while Sie went home to get the bag. However, during cross-examination he said that he only met them after Sie had gone home and showed him the knife. 
Q: So after Ah Choon had taken the parang what did you do? 
A: We were going to turn and leave. 
Q: Who are `we`? 
A: Ah Chye (Kok Chye), Banka (Vincent) and I. 
 
Q: So Ah Choon went alone to confront the group? 
A: No. 
Q: So what did Ah Choon do with the parang? 
A: He met his friends three to four of them. 
Q: Where did he meet these friends? 
A: At the main road. 
Q: You mean after hearing you, he went to meet his friends? 
A: No. 
Q: Then? 
While we were hearing we saw his friends at the main road. sorry, it should be on the way to Blk 3 Geylang Serai, we met his friends.
 19.Another inconsistency was that he only mentioned meeting Lucas during his cross-examination and Sie subsequently telling him (the appellant) that there was a matter at Geylang Serai after Sie had conversed with Lucas alone. However, in his examination-in-chief, he did not mention seeing Lucas. In fact he said that, when he first met up with Sie, Sie told him that there was a matter at Geylang Serai. Furthermore and quite surprisingly, there was no mention of these three or four friends of Sie in the appellant`s conditioned statement `D1` made four days after the incident.
 20.The appellant`s evidence was also contradicted by Kok Chye`s evidence that he only met the appellant on the way up to his flat. The appellant on the other hand claimed that Kok Chye was with him the entire time and, more importantly, turned away with him after seeing Sie produce a knife.
 21.It was also strange that the appellant did not call Vincent to give evidence on his behalf. After all, only three persons could say whether he held the knife or not, of which two said that he did (ie Sie and Kok Chye). That being the case, it was very surprising that he did not call Vincent to give evidence to refute Sie and Kok Chye`s claims. Section 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act states that: 
The Court may presume - 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.
 As such, it could be presumed that the appellant did not call Vincent to give evidence because it would only substantiate Sie and Kok Chye`s claims.
 22.On the totality of the evidence, I was of the view that the trial judge was correct to accept Sie`s evidence instead of the appellant`s. Sie`s evidence was clear and consistent. He had nothing to gain from implicating the appellant as he had already been convicted and sentenced. The appellant argued that Sie would be motivated by the fact that he would want to protect his brother and that he was angry with the appellant for not going with him to join in the fight. First, in my view this sort of unsubstantiated speculation was the type that one indulged in when one`s case has little merit. Secondly, and more importantly, it was very difficult to see why Sie would need to implicate the appellant in order to protect his brother. If anything, the appellant`s evidence exonerated Kok Chye. This was because, if the evidence was believed, both of them would be found to have had no part to play in the matter. However, by placing doubt on the appellant`s evidence that he had walked away with Kok Chye when the knife was produced, it also cast doubt on the fact that Kok Chye was not one of the other three men seen by Loo and Ahmad.
 23.Furthermore, it was unclear why Kok Chye would have any reason to implicate the appellant as his brother had already been convicted and sentenced. In fact he would have made his own case, for his lack of participation in the matter, stronger if he and the appellant corroborated each other`s stories that they both walked away from Sie when he produced the knife.
 24.On the other hand the appellant`s evidence was inconsistent, especially on the most important issue: the existence of the three or four friends of Sie. His only other option would have been to call Vincent to testify that he had turned away upon seeing the knife but for some inexplicable reason he did not do so. All this, coupled with the fact that the trial judge had the advantage of witnessing the demeanour of the two witnesses below, led to the conclusion that there was no good reason to deviate from the findings of the trial judge as it could not be said to have been clearly reached against the weight of the evidence ( 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 ).
 25.
 Sentence
The appellant was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The appellant argued that Sie had antecedents and he was the one who procured the knives and he was only sentenced to six months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. However, the appellant had no previous antecedents and played only a smaller role in the matter as he did not procure the knives. As such, the trial judge had erred in giving him a sentence equal to Sie`s.
 26.In my view, the appellant`s appeal against sentence was without merit. Sie had given himself up to the police immediately at the scene of the crime and had co-operated with the police. On the hand, the appellant fled the scene and tried to fabricate a story about how there were another three or four persons present. As such, despite the appellant`s lack of antecedents and the smaller role he played in the matter, the trial judge below could not be faulted for giving him the same sentence as Sie.",1998-08-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

TAY YONG KWANG JC
 This is an appeal from a decision of the learned District Judge in OS 38/98, which is an interpleader summons taken out under O 17 of the Rules of Court.
 2.
 The facts leading to this originating summons 
 
Lim Kheng Dee (`Lim`) and Ong Sai Geok (`Ong`) are husband and wife. They owned as joint tenants a unit (`the property`) in the condominium known as Loyang Valley. This was mortgaged to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (`OCBC`) pursuant to a mortgage dated 10 March 1994. The mortgagors Lim and Ong defaulted in the repayment of the sums due under this mortgage and OCBC exercised its powers of sale thereunder.
 3.The following is a chronology of the material events leading to the interpleader summons before the court:
 
(1)
15 May 1996
-
Focal Finance Ltd (`Focal`) obtained judgment against Lim only.
(2)
25 November 1996
-
Focal registered a writ of seizure and sale (`WSS`) against Lim`s interest in the property.
(3)
5 December 1996
-
Malayan Banking Bhd (`MBB`) obtained judgment against both Lim and Ong.
(4)
6 March 1997
-
MBB registered a WSS against the said property of both Lim and Ong.
(5)
7 May 1997
-
OCBC sold the property.
(6)
16 July 1997
-
OCBC`s sale of the property completed.
(7)
25 July 1997
-
Both Lim and Ong were adjudicated bankrupts.
 4.Upon completion of the sale of the property, and after settlement of all amounts owed under the mortgage, there was a residue of $146,479.29. Ordinarily, such surplus would have been paid over to the mortgagors as the `person who appears from the land-register to be entitled to the mortgaged property` within the meaning of s 74(1) of the Land Titles Act (`LTA`). However, both Focal and MBB made claims to this amount. Initially, there were two other creditors of Lim and Ong which had registered WSS against the property. These two creditors, together with the Official Assignee, withdrew from the dispute concerning the excess amount before the originating summons was first heard in the subordinate courts.
 5.Lim and Ong had, through their solicitors` letter dated 24 July 1997, informed OCBC`s solicitors that they intended to divide the surplus proceeds of sale into two equal shares, paying Focal and another creditor the half share of Lim while paying MBB the other half share belonging to Ong. MBB did not agree with this method of distribution.
 6.After a series of correspondence between the interested parties, past and present, this originating summons was taken out by OCBC for the court to resolve the validity of the competing claims.
 7.
 The deputy registrar`s decision 
 
Before the deputy registrar of the subordinate courts, only Focal and MBB remained as the competing claimants to the surplus proceeds of sale of the property. If Focal`s WSS was effective, Focal would take half of the surplus proceeds of sale since it took the position that Lim`s interest in the property was a half share and its WSS had priority by virtue of ss 37 and 132 LTA. The learned deputy registrar ordered that the whole of the said surplus (less OCBC`s costs of $1,500 for the originating summons) be paid to MBB.
 8.
 The district judge`s decision 
 
Focal appealed to the district judge in chambers. The learned district judge allowed the appeal and ordered MBB to pay Focal half of the surplus less the said $1,500 costs of OCBC. He made no order as to the costs of the appeal before him.
 9.The reasoning of the learned district judge can be found in the following paragraphs of his grounds of decision (with Focal referred to as the first defendant and MBB referred to as the second defendant): 
8 Learned counsel for the first defendant cited the case of 
Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah & Anor
 
[1987] SLR 182
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
 . (This Court of Appeal decision was not cited in the proceedings before the deputy registrar). In that case, the court made an order (called the settlement order) that the matrimonial property held under a joint tenancy be sold and the proceeds divided equally. The following appears at [
[1987] SLR 182
, 191-192; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
, 347] (also reproduced at p 64 of the first defendant`s bundle of authorities dated 19 May 1998):
 
`... there is still the question whether the settlement order, when made, had the effect of severing the joint tenancy in the said property. We are of the opinion that it did. The court by making the settlement order in the form it did (ie by ordering a sale of the said property and the distribution of the proceeds of sale equally between the parties) intended to divide the said property between the parties without any limitation as to the length of life of either of them`.
 
9 Learned counsel submitted that by analogy, the court order pursuant to the first defendants` writ of seizure and sale (which appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998 in support of the plaintiffs` interpleader summons) must have the same effect, that is, the court`s order that the interest of the judgment debtor Lim Kheng Dee (one of the joint tenants) in the property be seized and sold must be construed as an order that has severed the joint tenancy. 
10 Learned counsel for the second defendant tried to distinguish 
 Sivakolunthu 
`s case by saying that in that case there was an order for sale whereas in the order here, pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale of the first defendant, (as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998), there was only an order for attachment and not for sale. I did not accept this argument as a plain reading of the order made, as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998, clearly shows that the order was made pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale and the order was that not only the property be `attached` but it is to be `taken in execution to satisfy the judgment` obtained by the first defendant (the underlining is mine for emphasis). 
11 Learned counsel for the first defendant submitted that, as in the case of 
 Sivakolunthu 
, there was an order for sale in present case. He said that the order by writ of seizure and sale, as appears at p 26 of the affidavit of Lee Siew Sen filed on 15 January 1998, was not only for a seizure. That order reads that the property is to be `... attached and taken in execution to satisfy the judgment ...`. He said that obviously one cannot satisfy a judgment unless the property is sold. I accepted the submissions of learned counsel for the first defendant. 
12 Accordingly, I allowed the appeal by the first defendant and set aside the order of the deputy registrar ordering that the sum of $146,479.29 be paid to the second defendant, after deduction of the plaintiff`s costs of $1,500. 
13 As the first defendant was claiming only half of the sum of $146,479.29, I ordered the second defendant to pay the sum of $73,239.65 to the first defendant (less $1,500 being the plaintiff`s costs). I did not make any order on costs of the appeal, as learned counsel for the first defendant conceded that he did not cite 
 Sivakolunthu 
`s case in the proceedings below and counsel for the second defendant said he did not ask for any costs in the proceedings before the deputy registrar.
 10.MBB then lodged an appeal against the learned district judge`s decision.
 11.
 My decision 
 
On 1 February 1992, the provisions on the charging order on land in O 50 of the then Rules of the Supreme Court were repealed. In place of the charging order on land, the Rules introduced the writ of seizure and sale against land. On 1 April 1992, the then Rules of the Subordinate Courts followed suit. Both sets of Rules have been consolidated as the Rules of Court since 1 April 1996.
 12.The Land Titles Act applies to the property in question by virtue of s 4 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. Sections 131 to 136 of the LTA and O 47 rr 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court provide the broad framework for a WSS on land or immovable property. Section 131 of the LTA speaks of a writ of execution against `land`, which is defined in s 4(1) of the Act to include any estate or interest therein. `Interest`, in turn, is defined as meaning any interest in land recognised as such by law and including an estate in land. Order 47 r 4(1) speaks of `immovable property or any interest therein` and `attaching the interest of the judgment debtor in the immovable property`. Before we can determine whether `interest` includes a judgment debtor`s interest as one of the joint tenants of a property, we must first examine the legal qualities of a joint tenancy.
 13.WJM Ricquier in 
 Land Law 
 (1985 Ed) at pp 54 and 55 states: 
There are two forms of co-ownership applicable in Singapore, joint tenancy and tenancy in common. In the case of joint tenancy, A and B, as against the rest of the world, have the rights of a single owner, although they have individual rights as against one another. In particular, when one joint tenant dies, his interest, irrespective of any direction to the contrary in his will, and of the intestacy rules, passes to the other joint tenant(s): this is called the right of survivorship. The other unique characteristic of joint tenancy is the presence of the four unities. Unity of possession indicates that each of the tenants is equally entitled to the property; unity of interest indicates that their interests must be equal in quality and quantity (and not, eg, a fee simple and a lease for twenty-one years); unity of title means that all the tenants must derive their interests under the same document; and unity of time means that all interests must vest at the same time. Unity of possession is common to both forms of co-ownership. If any of the others is missing the parties are tenants in common rather than joint tenants.
 
Tenancy in common is quite different. There is no right of survivorship and each tenant in common can leave his share of the property in his will. Whereas in a joint tenancy no individual can be an owner of a distinct share of the property, tenants in common do own shares in a piece of land that has not yet been divided up between them.
 14.In similar vein, Associate Professor Tan Sook Yee writes in 
 Principles of Singapore Land Law 
 (1994 Ed) as follows (at pp 87 and 88):
 Joint tenancy is that form of co-ownership where each of the co-owners owns the whole interest. There are no shares. As between the joint tenants themselves, they have rights; however, as against the world, they are viewed as one.
 15.Section 53(3) LTA permits tenants in common to convert their co-ownership to one of joint tenancy by lodging an instrument of declaration `that they hold the estate or interest in their respective shares in the registered land as joint tenants of the entire estate or interest thereof`. All shares therefore merge upon conversion to joint tenancy. Order 47 r 5(g), which allows the Sheriff to apply to the court for directions concerning the sale of immovable property seized under a WSS, also provides for notice of such application to be given to the judgment creditor, the judgment debtor and `any other party interested in the property`. It can of course be argued that `any other party interested in the property` includes joint tenants. However, this should not be the case. Although joint tenancy in immovable property is an interest recognised in law, the `interest of the judgment debtor` attachable under a WSS under O 47 r 4(1)(a) must surely be a distinct and identifiable one. A joint tenant has no distinct and identifiable share in land for as long as the joint tenancy subsists. To seize one joint tenant`s interest is to seize also the interest of his co-owners when they are not subject to the judgment which is being enforced. Similarly, `the interest which belongs to the judgment debtor` which may be sold in execution (s 135(1) LTA) must be distinct and identifiable and cannot be a joint interest held with someone not subject to the judgment and the execution. A WSS cannot therefore attach the interest of a joint tenant unless it concomitantly severs the joint tenancy.
 16.Severance of a joint tenancy may be achieved at common law by alienation of an interest, mutual agreement or mutual conduct. The bankruptcy of a joint tenant also severs the tenancy and passes his interest to his trustee in bankruptcy (
 Cheshire & Burn`s Modern Law of Real Property 
 (14th Ed, 1988) at p 212). Severance may also be achieved through statutory mechanisms such as, in the case of registered land, an instrument of declaration pursuant to s 53(5) LTA. None of these acts of severance took place in this case. As can be seen from the chronology of events, by the time Lim and Ong were adjudicated bankrupts, the mortgagee`s sale of the property had been completed. Similarly, their declaration of intention in their solicitors` letter of 24 July 1997 to divide the surplus proceeds of sale into two equal shares did not and could not change the fact of their joint tenancy ex post facto.
 17.In my opinion, the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
 Sivakolunthu v Shanmugam Nagaiah & Anor 
 (supra) cannot apply to the situation here. The order for the sale of the property held in joint tenancy and the division of the proceeds therefrom (called the `settlement order` in that case) was made pursuant to s 106(1) Women`s Charter (the precursor of the present s 112), which has no application to the facts of this case whatsoever. However, the Court of Appeal also said the following immediately after the passage quoted by the learned district judge (at 
[1987] SLR 182
, 192; 
[1988] 1 MLJ 341
, 347): 
The severance was not effected by an act of the parties but by an order of court. In principle, there is no reason why a court order may not have such an effect. All orders of court made in exercise of its powers to make partition orders have such effect even where the order has not been carried into effect before the death of a party to the proceedings.
 A WSS against land is an order of court granted ex parte but it is not an order that must necessarily result in a sale. This is reinforced by the use of the words `and thereafter, if necessary, to sell the said interest ...` in Form 95E which is the direction to the Sheriff/Bailiff. The sale may be postponed and subsequently abandoned because of the sale of any other property of the judgment debtor (O 47 r 5(c)). There may be an appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits or a receiver and manager of the immovable property `in lieu of sale` (O 47 r 5(d)). The WSS may be withdrawn (O 47 r 9). Similarly, registration of the WSS may be cancelled because it has lapsed (s 134 LTA) or has been withdrawn (s 136 LTA).
 18.Bearing in mind that any of the above contingencies could happen, it would be creating a fine mess to hold that a WSS when registered severs a joint tenancy. What would be the position of the co-owners in relation to each other should the WSS subsequently be withdrawn or its registration lapse? Do they revert to being joint tenants again? If the WSS is renewed or a second or subsequent one issued, do the rights of the co-owners change once again? A further argument against severance is that registration of the WSS (if it were possible to do so) merely prevents transfers of interest by the joint tenant, such that there is no severance of the joint tenancy until the Sheriff transfers the judgment debtor`s interest to another person. In favour of this is the fact that on the register, the judgment debtor remains a joint owner of the property, and in terms of form, maintains the same interest as his co-owner. For these reasons, I hold that registration of the WSS does not sever a joint tenancy.
 19.My holding accords with the legal position in Canada. The position in Canada is that delivery of a writ of execution to the Sheriff does not by itself amount to severance: 
Power v Grace
 
[1932] 1 DLR 801
; 
Re Young
 
[1968] 70 DLR (2d) 594
; 
Re McDonald and The Queen
 
[1969] 8 DLR (3d) 666
; 
Sunglo Lumber Ltd v McKenna
 
[1974] 48 DLR (3d) 154
; and the point was not doubted in 
Bank of Montreal v Pawluk
 
[1992] 88 DLR (4th) 570
. 
 Power v Grace 
 was a decision of the York County Court, and the report of the judgment is abbreviated. It involved an execution lodged against a joint tenant who died before sale. The question was whether the lodging of execution in the hands of the Sheriff amounted to severance. Widdifield, Co Ct J is reported to have held: 
Although the delivery of the writ to the sheriff binds the lands from the date of delivery, it does not change the ownership ...
 
The continuance of the joint tenancy depends on the maintenance of the union of title, interest and possession, and a destruction of any of these unities leads to a severance.
 
...
 
The trend of the authorities is that a mere lien or charge on the land, either by a co-tenant or by operation of law, is not sufficient to sever the joint tenancy; there must be something that amounts to an alienation of title.
 The decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal: [1932] 2 DLR 793.
 20.In 
 Re Young 
, the British Columbia Court of Appeal had to consider whether the mere registration of a judgment under the Execution Act severed a joint tenancy so as to prevent the operation of the right of survivorship. Maclean and MacFarlane JJA were both of the opinion that mere registration was not sufficient. In doing so, they departed from a prior decision of their court, 
Re Application of Penn
 
[1951] 4 WWR (NS) 452
, and followed 
 Power v Grace 
. The statement of Widdifield Co Ct J above was cited and approved by Maclean JA. McFarlane JA agreed with Maclean JA on this point. Davey CJBC dissented. His Honour was of the opinion that upon interpretation of the relevant statute, registration created an equitable charge, which severs a joint tenancy. This flowed from the fact that equity will do what the joint tenant intended to do and an equitable charge evinces an intention to sever where it is necessary to do so in order to implement a contract entered into by the joint tenant (at p 598). His Honour further noted (at p 599): 
I must say that I find that result satisfactory, because it makes answerable for a judgment the judgment debtor`s interest in a joint tenancy over which he had in himself complete power of disposal in his lifetime, and avoids one of the highly technical consequences of a joint tenancy, as contrasted with a tenancy in common, that has little to commend it in the light of modern needs. Regrettably, it falls short of making that interest liable after the joint tenant`s prior death for his debts generally.
 In Canada, therefore, registration of a judgment also does not sever a joint tenancy.
 21.There is also a conceptual difficulty in Focal`s arguments that a WSS severs a joint tenancy and attaches to the share of the judgment debtor according to the number of joint tenants. Megarry in 
 Law of Real Property 
 (3rd Ed, 1966), states at p 416: 
Although no joint tenant owned any distinct share in the land, yet each had a potential share equal in size to that of his companions, and so depending upon the number of joint tenants at the time in question.
 This statement does not mean that joint tenants would always take a share according to the number of joint tenants. It is at best a `potential` equal share. In matrimonial property disputes, as in any other property disputes, proportionate severance has never been an immutable rule where joint tenancies were involved. The maxim, equality is equity, if applied indiscriminately to all circumstances would create inequity in a great number of cases, whether they involve matrimonial disputes or otherwise. The shares of joint tenants must be ascertained with regard to all the circumstances of the case. Lim and Ong`s declaration of intention in their solicitors` letter of 24 July 1997 has little value as it was expressed only after all the events had taken place and it became clear that both of them would not benefit from the sale proceeds in any way. If Ong had not been a judgment debtor too, one should not be surprised if she were to assert that she should have the lion`s share in the property despite the joint tenancy. Equally, it should not be surprising if Lim came out to support his wife`s assertion.
 22.Focal submitted further that the rule that joint tenants have shares in the estate proportionate to the number of joint tenants upon severance is recognised by the statutory form to be filed under s 53(5) LTA. In this form, a joint tenant who desires to sever a joint tenancy declares that: 
... I am the registered proprietor of the land as joint tenant together with the other Registered Proprietor/s hereinafter mentioned and that I wish to sever the joint tenancy and hold the land as a tenant in common with the other Registered Proprietor/s in the share proportionate to the number of joint tenants.
 With respect, this form does not decree proportionate severance in every case. If the registered proprietors become tenants in common without specifying their respective shares, s 53(2) LTA would presume that they are entitled in equal shares. The form can be modified to express the intention of the joint tenants (see s 7 Interpretation Act). Of course, if a dispute then arises among the joint tenants, they can take the matter to court for their various entitlements to be determined. Even s 57(5A)(b) of the Income Tax Act recognizes that joint owners of land do not always take equal shares in the land or the sale proceeds thereof. That section therefore has to provide a presumption as follows: 
For the purposes of payment of any tax due. ... from the proceeds of sale of any immovable property owned by two or more persons as joint owners, the following provisions shall apply:
 
(a) ... 
(b) it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, ... that the joint owners of any immovable property shall share the proceeds of sale of the property equally;
 23.How then can a judgment creditor proceed against a judgment debtor who is one of two or more joint tenants of land? The answer appears to be, by appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution (O 30 and O 51). This is one of the modes of enforcement of a judgment contemplated in O 45 r 1(1). Under O 30 r 1, an injunction ancillary or incidental to an order appointing a receiver may also be made to restrain the judgment debtor from assigning, charging or otherwise dealing with the property.
 24.In summary, a WSS against immovable property cannot be used to enforce a judgment against a debtor who is one of two or more joint tenants of that immovable property. The WSS taken out and registered by Focal was therefore invalid and must be set aside. Accordingly, MBB is entitled to the entire sum of the surplus proceeds of sale after deducting OCBC`s costs of $1,500.
 25.I respectfully disagree with the learned district judge and allow MBB`s appeal. The costs of this appeal should follow the event. However, in view of the way the application proceeded before the deputy registrar and the district judge, I do not propose to disturb the decisions below that there be no order as to costs at each stage. The deputy registrar`s and the district judge`s orders on costs are to stand. The appeal is therefore allowed with costs of this appeal before the High Court to be paid by Focal to MBB.",1998-12-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 On 22 July 1998, the appellant pleaded guilty to two charges: 
... that you on 29 April 1998 at about 8.35am along Corporation Road, Singapore, did permit one Naim bin Pardi to use motor lorry No XA 9897 E whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance in respect of the third party risk as complies with the requirements of this Act, and you have thereby committed an offence s 3(1) and punishable under s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189).
 
... that you on 29 April 1998 at about 8.35am along Corporation Road, Singapore, did permit one Naim bin Pardi to use motor lorry No XA 9897 E for which a licence under Part 1 of RTA Cap 276 was not in force, to wit, road tax expired on 31.12.97 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 For the first charge, the district judge fined the appellant $600 and ordered that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes for the minimum period of 12 months. The appellant was fined $500 for the second charge.
 2.By Criminal Revision No 23 of 1998, the appellant petitioned for criminal revision in respect of both charges. In Magistrates Appeal No 209/98/01, he appealed against the sentence for the first charge. On 27 October 1998, I dismissed both applications. These are my reasons.
 3.
 The appellant`s case 
 
Counsel applied for the appeal against sentence to be heard first, so that, if the appeal were successful, the defence would not seek revision of the decision below. I refused to allow such an application of the law. A bona fide petition for revision appeals to the court to judiciously exercise its powers to correct any error of law which appears from the record of the case. To suggest that the allegedly grave error of law could be corrected by a successful appeal against sentence would abuse the process of revision. In the circumstances, I directed counsel for the appellant to submit on the petition for revision first.
 4.The appellant`s case was that on the date of the accident, 29 April 1998, legal title to the vehicle No XA 9897 E had been transferred. This, he claimed, had been effected in the sale of the vehicle to Transit-Mixed Concrete Ltd (`TMC`) in an agreement recorded on 13 March 1998. His case was that the driver in question, Naim bin Pardi (`Pardi`), although formerly in his employ had transferred his services to the purchasers of the vehicle, following the sale of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the appellant contended that he should not be held liable for the offence of permitting the vehicle to be driven when there was no valid insurance coverage and unpaid road tax.
 5.Alternatively, his case was that, although the original insurance coverage by UMBC Insurans Sdn Bhd`s had expired on 31 March 1998, the vehicle was insured by Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd (`Eagle`) at the material time. The evidence he adduced in support of this was a Land Transport Authority Vehicle Information Enquiry Reply. This document was obtained on 31 July 1998.
 6.
 The appeal 
 
I noted that the district judge had taken into account the sale of the vehicle at para 7 of her grounds of decision. She made two observations which should be put on record. First, the transfer had not been effected. Second, she found that nonetheless it was an offence for him to permit another person to use the vehicle pending the transfer when there was no valid insurance policy or road tax in force.
 7.Before me, I was assisted by the evidence of the driver, Pardi, now working as a sweeper, who on 20 October 1998 had sworn an affidavit stating that he had worked as a part-time driver for the appellant`s company, Zement Transit Services, up till 29 April 1998 when the accident occurred. Pardi went even further to declare that he had never heard of the purchasers, TMC; nor, for that matter, was he aware of the sale of the vehicle he was driving on 29 April 1998. I was not given any evidence that contradicted Pardi`s statement. In my view, it had been clearly established that Pardi drove the vehicle in question, No XA 9897 E, under the directions of the only employer he knew, that is, the appellant.
 8.Next, I considered the evidence on whether the vehicle was insured at the material time. In this respect, Staff Sergeant Oh Hwee Kee had sworn an affidavit dated 20 October 1998, stating that enquiries with the LTA showed that as at 29 April 1998 the vehicle was without a valid license. The LTA records stated that the present insurance policy had been taken up with effect from 3 June 1998. Prior to this, the previous policy had expired on 31 December 1997 and there was no record of any insurance coverage in the intervening period. I found that counsel for the appellant`s two letters to Eagle and one letter to the purchasers, TMC, demonstrated nothing more than a futile attempt to determine whether the vehicle was insured by Eagle.
 9.Staff Sergeant Oh`s affidavit also included a letter from Eagle, now trading as Zurich Eagle Insurance (ZES). ZES had forwarded to S/Sergeant Oh a copy of the insurance broker`s instructions in a letter dated 4 May 1998, directing that insurance coverage for XA 9897 E be cancelled. The evidence was that the sale of the vehicle had been aborted. Therefore the transfer of ownership of XA 9897 E had not been effected. TMC only purchased insurance for the vehicles whose transfer of ownership had been registered, that is, Nos XA 7564, XA 7318 and WB 1433.
 10.
 Conclusion 
 
On the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the appellant had possession and control of the use of XA 9897 on 29 April 1998 and that there was no valid insurance coverage or road tax in force. I could not find any good reason to intervene with the district judge`s imposition of a fine and the mandatory period of disqualification. Accordingly, the petition for revision and the appeal against sentence were dismissed.",1999-01-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
GOH JOON SENG J
 The plaintiff`s claim was for damages for libel contained in two letters from the defendant, namely: (i). a letter of 8 January 1997 with details attached (`letter of 8 January`) to the Council of the Association of Singapore Realtors (`ASR`);
 (ii). a letter of 20 February 1997 (`letter of 20 February`) to the plaintiff`s solicitors Sim Mong Teck & Partners enclosing a copy of the letter of 8 January, all carbon copied to ASR, Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (`SISV`) and the Association of Singapore Real Estate Agents (`ASREA`).
 2.The defendant admitted the publication, but denied liability, relying on the defence of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege. The defendant also counterclaimed for damages for libel contained in the November 1996 issue of an in-house newsletter (`the newsletter`) of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd (`Louis Yeap Realty`) which runs a real estate agency.
 3.The plaintiff joined issue with the defendant on his defence and contended that the publication was actuated by malice on the part of the defendant. On the defendant`s counterclaim, the plaintiff denied that the words contained in the newsletter were understood or capable of being understood to refer to the defendant. In any event, they were true in substance and in fact. In the alternative they were fair comment and were published on an occasion of qualified privilege.
 4.At the end of the hearing I found for the plaintiff and awarded him $40,000 plus costs. I dismissed the defendant`s counterclaim with costs. The defendant has appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my reasons.
 5.
 Terms of remuneration of a marketing agent of Louis Yeap Realty 
 
If an agent secures an exclusive authorisation from the owner to sell the property he is known as the `exclusive lister`. The exclusive lister may appoint an agent (`marketing agent`) to market the property under a co-broking agreement. On the sale of the property by the marketing agent, the commission is divided equally between the exclusive lister and the marketing agent subject to an overrider of 20% of the commission to Louis Yeap Realty. If the marketing agent (`Marketing Agent A`) is unable to find a buyer before the expiry of his appointment, he submits a list of six prospective purchasers who have responded to his advertisements. Another marketing agent, Marketing Agent B, is then appointed to market the property. During the term of Marketing Agent B`s appointment, if the property is sold to a purchaser who is among the six named in Marketing Agent A`s list, Marketing Agent B will get only 10%. The balance will be shared equally between the exclusive lister and Marketing Agent A, subject again to the overrider of 20% of the commission to Louis Yeap Realty.
 6.
 The parties 
 
The plaintiff is the managing director of Louis Yeap Realty. The defendant was an estate agent with Louis Yeap Realty from 29 December 1995 to 13 January 1997.
 7.
 The factual background 
 
In the course of his work, the defendant marketed several properties under Louis Yeap Realty. These included 26 Burnfoot Terrace, 7A Jalan Rindu, Liberty Warehouse and 26 Pasir Panjang Hill. These properties were the subject matter of the two letters. 7A Jalan Rindu was also the subject matter of the newsletter and of the counterclaim. It is therefore necessary to recount what transpired in these four transactions.
 8.
 26 Burnfoot Terrace (`Burnfoot Terrace`) 
 
On 18 January 1996, the plaintiff was given the exclusive authorisation by the owner of the property to sell it for him. The plaintiff in turn appointed one Stephen Pang to be the marketing agent under a co-broking agreement. The plaintiff had known Stephen Pang since 1965 when they were both working for a pharmaceutical company. Stephen Pang`s appointment was for the period 18 January 1996 to 26 February 1996. The appointment was then extended to 11 March 1996. Stephen Pang placed a number of advertisements in the newspapers giving the `built in` area as 1,500 sq ft. He could not find a buyer for the property. On the expiry of his appointment, he submitted a list of 13 potential purchasers who had viewed the property.
 9.As an outgoing marketing agent was entitled to submit a list of only six potential purchasers, the plaintiff told Stephen Pang that he would take note of only the first six names in the list and ignore the rest.
 10.On 12 March 1996, the plaintiff appointed the defendant as the marketing agent to market the property for the period 12 March 1996 to 18 April 1996. The defendant inserted a few advertisements also giving the `built in` area as 1,500 sq ft.
 11.On 25 March 1996, the defendant, through a housing agent with another real estate agency, secured a buyer for the property. In consideration of the payment of 1%, that is $10,900, the buyer was granted an option to purchase the property for $1,090,000.
 12.The deal was rescinded by the buyer when he discovered that the `built in` area was only 1,195 sq ft and not 1,500 sq ft.
 13.On 2 April 1996, a potential buyer was referred to Stephen Pang. He was not one of the first six potential purchasers in Stephen Pang`s list. So the commission, less the 20% to Louis Yeap Realty, would have to be shared equally among Stephen Pang, plaintiff and defendant. Unknown to the plaintiff, Stephen Pang had kept in touch with the owner after his appointment as the marketing agent had lapsed.
 14.While on the way to meet his potential buyer to collect the 1% option fee, Stephen Pang called the defendant seeking his help to draw up an option and requesting the latter to meet him at Burnfoot Terrace with the option. The defendant refused. Stephen Pang then called the office of Louis Yeap Realty. The call was picked up by the plaintiff`s son, Paul Yeap, who immediately rushed down to Burnfoot Terrace with the option for the owner`s signature and the deal was thus secured. According to the plaintiff and Stephen Pang, for the part played by Paul Yeap, Stephen Pang suggested in the presence of the defendant that 10% of the commission be paid to Paul Yeap. They both said the defendant did not object to the suggestion. This however was disputed by the defendant.
 15.On completion, Louis Yeap Realty received 1[lowbar]% commission amounting to $16,500. This was divided equally among the plaintiff, defendant and Stephen Pang. On 20 July 1997, the defendant was handed a cheque for $3,520 arrived as follows:
 
(1)
1/3 of $16,500
$5500
(2)
Less 20% to Louis Yeap Realty, ie
$1100
$4400
(3)
Less 10% of that to Paul Yeap
$ 440
(4)
Less 10% to the referrer who referred the buyer to Stephen Pang
$ 440
(5)
Nett amount
$3520
 16.The defendant was unhappy with the 10% fee each paid to Paul Yeap and Stephen Pang`s referrer. So, on the instruction of the plaintiff, Louis Yeap Realty reimbursed the defendant the $440 paid to Paul Yeap. The cheque was enclosed with the plaintiff`s letter of 22 July 1996 setting out the sequence as follows:

Dear Pete,
 
RE: 26 BURNFOOT TERRACE,
 
SINGAPORE 459818
 
I refer to our meeting on 19 July 1996 regarding your objections raised concerning payment of a 10% referral fee paid to Paul Yeap. Because Paul is my son, it is necessary that this matter be placed on record to avoid distortion and misinterpretation in view of his relationship with the company.
 
The following sequence is on file. You are welcome to correct any events which are inaccurate:
 
(1) Stephen Pang was the first LY Agent to market subject property. The internal Co-broking Agreement with Stephen expired on 11 March 1996. 
(2) You became the second LY Agent as per our Co-broking Agreement dated 12 March 1996 which expired on 18 April 1996. 
(3) You commenced marketing the property as of 16 March 1996 and through another agent, Ms Sylvia Ng of REB, secured a buyer Mr Lai Kam Yew on 25 March 1996 at the sale price of S$1,090,000.00. This would be a co-broking arrangement between Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd and REB based on a 3-way Co-broke. However, this sale did not materialise as the deposit payment was withdrawn. 
(4) Sometime on 31 March 1996 or 1 April 1996, Stephen Pang contacted you as he had an interested party to view subject property. There was some miscommunication between both of you but as the buyer, Mr Ahamed Shariff bin Ana Mohd Ibrhim, was particularly keen, Stephen called Paul for help. It was a productive meeting and a 1% deposit was taken. Sale price was S$1,100,000.00. 
(5) Because of Paul`s involvement in the negotiations and completing the documentation, it was agreed that Paul would receive a 10% referral and I recall discussing and confirmed this referral with both Stephen and yourself. Collectively, there was no objection then and the subject was closed as the paperwork had been completed including the standard Transaction Form which spelt out the split in the commission. 
(6) When the proceeds of the commission were made on 19 July 1996, you expressed dissatisfaction that you had to contribute one third (1/3) of the 10% referral fee to Paul. You raised the issue on the following: 
(a) Paul initially told you that you would only receive 10% as a referral for the sale. This was quickly corrected the next day as the buyer was not on Stephen`s list and that the sale would be co-broked 3-way (Louis Yeap/Stephen Pang/Pete Choo). 
(b) If you had known that it was a 3-way co-broke, you would have preferred to meet Stephen Pang and his buyer to save the referral fee. 
(7) To avoid further dialogue on the subject, I have decided to return your share of the Singapore Dollars Four Hundred and Forty Only (S$440.00) paid to Paul. This deduction cannot come from Paul since he did his job to negotiate and complete the documentations. The company will now absorb your portion of the referral fee paid to Paul.
 
Yours faithfully
 
LOUIS YEAP REALTY PTE LTD

Louis Yeap
 There was no reply from the defendant disputing the sequence set out in the plaintiff`s letter.

The plaintiff was granted exclusive authorisation by the owner to sell the property for the period 25 February 1995 to 30 April 1995.
 18.As the exclusive lister, the plaintiff appointed one Ronny Foo to be the first marketing agent for the period 1 March 1995 to 15 March 1995. On expiry thereof, the plaintiff appointed one Chua Yu-Jin as the second marketing agent for the period 16 March 1995 to 16 April 1995.
 19.The property remained unsold at the expiry of the plaintiff`s exclusive authorisation.
 20.In May 1996, the owner contacted the plaintiff again and gave him exclusive authorisation to sell the property for the period 13 May 1996 to 13 August 1996.
 21.The plaintiff then appointed the defendant as the marketing agent for the period 13 May 1996 to 12 June 1996. At the request of the defendant the appointment was extended to 21 July 1996.
 22.The defendant secured a buyer for the property at $1,600,000. An option at a fee of $16,000 was granted. The purchaser however failed to exercise the option and his option fee was forfeited. He however indicated he would be interested to buy the property at $1,450.000.
 23.The plaintiff`s exclusive authorisation was extended to 15 November 1996. He then appointed one Terence Teng to be the marketing agent for the period 14 August 1996 to 16 September 1996. Terence Teng was unable to secure a buyer.
 24.The plaintiff then appointed one Thomas Tham to market the property. Thomas Tham is a personal friend of the plaintiff. In October 1996, Thomas Tham found a buyer for the property at $1,448,000. When this was reported to the plaintiff, he mentioned it to the defendant. The defendant thereupon insisted that his buyer who did not exercise the option should be given right of first refusal to buy the property at $1,450.000. This was only $2,000 more than what seemed to be a serious offer of $1,448,000 from Thomas Tham`s buyer. The plaintiff doubted that the defendant`s buyer was still interested since he had allowed his option to lapse more than two and a half months ago. Nevertheless, the plaintiff persuaded Thomas Tham to forego his entitlement to 50% commission as the marketing agent and agree to a three-way co-broking arrangement whereby the plaintiff, defendant and Thomas Tham would each get one third of the commission. But this was not acceptable to the defendant. The plaintiff then prevailed on Thomas Tham to delay finalizing the sale over the weekend so that the defendant could confirm with his buyer if the latter still wished to buy the property at $1,450,000. Three days later, the defendant disclosed that his buyer was no longer interested. Thomas Tham was then given clearance to proceed with the sale to his buyer at $1,448,000. By this time, Thomas Tham`s buyer was no longer prepared to buy the property at $1,448,000 as he felt that his offer had been used as a lever to persuade the defendant`s buyer to make an offer of $1,450,000. The property was eventually sold for $1,430,000 as the owner was cash strapped.

 26 Pasir Panjang Hill 
 
This property belonged to one Cho Jock Min and his wife. On being given the exclusive authorisation to sell the property, the plaintiff appointed the defendant as the first marketing agent to market the property for the period 19 June 1996 to 28 July 1996. The defendant failed to secure a buyer.
 26.On 6 August 1996, the plaintiff appointed one Tony Teo to be the marketing agent. Tony Teo secured a buyer on 27 August 1996 that is within three weeks.
 27.Cho Jock Min was appreciative of the results achieved by Tony Teo. To express his appreciation he wrote a letter dated 11 September 1996 reading as follows: 
Mr Tony Teo
 
Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
137 Market Street [num ]11-02
 
Bank of East Asia Building
 
Singapore 048943
 
Dear Tony,
 
My wife and I wish to extend our appreciation for the professionalism and sheer hard work by which you were able to secure a buyer for our house. Despite the current gloom over Singapore`s property market and the cautious attitudes of both home sellers and buyers, your press advertisements were able to attract the attention of the right group of people.
 
Once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks, and at the price we wanted.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Signed
 
Cho Jock Min
 28.Cho Jock Min`s letter of appreciation was later published along with other testimonials in Louis Yeap Realty`s brochure without the names of the agents to whom the testimonials were addressed. The rationale for leaving out the names of the addressees of the testimonials was stated in the caption which read: 
... The identity of the agents has been intentionally omitted in fairness to many other LY agents whose testimonials have not been selected for publication.
 29.
 The newsletter 
 
In November 1996, the plaintiff published in the newsletter the following article: 
An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired
 
This case happened in October 1996 between two LY associates. The management feel it is important enough to document the event openly as a learning experience so that a similar occurrence would be avoided in future.
 
First agent was marketing this two-storey Semi-D (L99) and obtained a buyer for S$1.6m. Unfortunately, the buyer failed to exercise the option and lost his 1% deposit. The owner who was anxious to save the sale had asked the buyer to propose an alternative price and the response from the buyer was $1.45m. Expectedly, the owner was not agreeable to this price and the matter was left as it was.
 
The responsibility to market this property was then passed to the second agent. After five weeks, a buyer was identified at S$1.45m. Agent [num ]2 took three days to convince the owner to accept this price which was finally agreed. The proposed options was then exchanged between the buyer`s and vendor`s lawyers and at this stage, agent [num ]1 insisted that his buyer who first made the offer of S$1.45m should be given priority. As the transaction was then at a critical stage of negotiation, agent [num ]2 was agreeable to a three-way co-broke (Lister/Agent [num ]1/Agent [num ]2). This compromise to co-broke three-way was not accepted by agent [num ]1 who claimed that he had earlier spent heavily on advertising the property and the commission proceeds would be split only between Lister and himself as a matter of policy.
 
As agent [num ]1 was confident that his buyer would take up the sale, Agent [num ]2 had to stop further discussions with his buyer and the relevant lawyers involved.
 
After three days, agent [num ]1 conceded finally that his buyer had changed his mind and wanted to negotiate for an even lower price. At this point, it was too late to go back to agent [num ]2`s buyer who felt that he was played out by agent [num ]2 in favor of another buyer.
 
The ending is obvious. No one benefited and at the expense of the owner who is still waiting for a buyer!!!
 
It would have been a win-win situation if only agent [num ]1 had not thought so much about his personal interest and let agent [num ]2 close the deal. This expensive experience has cost the relevant parties S$21,750 in commission just because of personal greed and over-confidence.
 30.
 Liberty Warehouse 
 
This property was sold by the defendant as the marketing agent appointed by the plaintiff. Completion took place on 4 December 1996. Following that, the defendant submitted his sale transaction form in which he stated: `expenses totalled $55.62`. This was apparently the costs of two newspaper advertisements inserted by the defendant. He was entitled to be reimbursed half of that by the plaintiff. But as no particulars were given as to what the expenses were and without supporting documents, the plaintiff did not reimburse the defendant pending their submission.
 31.
 Letter of 8 January 
 
It was against this backdrop that the defendant wrote the letter of 8 January addressed to the Council of ASR. It contained the offending words complained of. In order that the offending words may be construed in the context in which they appeared, the letter of 8 January is reproduced hereunder with the offending words complained of in italics:

Dear Sirs
 
Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
 I have several grievances against Mr Louis Yeap, a respected and senior member of your Association
.
 
 Generally, the level of professionalism in the industry today is rock bottom. I have no wish to report him to IRAS, the licensing body for Housing Agents at this moment in time as I believe you have the power to discipline an errant member
.
 
I sincerely hope that you can redress my grievances expeditiously, the details which I have attached herewith for your perusal. I can be reached at Pager No 9-215-9496.
 
Yours faithfully

A Deprivation of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace
 
It is well known in the market that Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd is one of the very few real estate agencies in Singapore to have Exclusive Listers and Marketing Agents. As an Agent, he is usually given a one month period to market the property assigned to him by the Lister. After the term expired, ie one month, the Lister will re-assign the property to another Agent in the event that the first Agent is unsuccessful in disposing the property.
 
The first Agent will then submit a list of maximum six (6) names of potential buyers to the company. Should a buyer in his list purchase the property subsequently after the second Agent has taken over the marketing, the second Agent would receive a maximum of 10% on the commission paid as a token referral from both the Lister (50%) and the first Agent (50%). All this is spelt out in the Company`s Operations Manual. (Please see Appendix I.)
 
In the case of 26 Burnfoot Terrace, I was appointed the second Agent after six (6) weeks of unsuccessful efforts on the part of the first Agent, Stephen Pang. Stephen is an old friend of the Lister, Louis Yeap, and they have known each other for more than 30 years. In fact, Stephen was Louis` subordinate in his salaried employment in a MNC before he joined the real estate industry.
 
When I was marketing the property after Stephen`s term expired, he brought potential buyers to the property without liaising with me, which means, in effect there were two agents marketing the property at the same time. When I reported to Louis on Stephen`s violation on the Code of Ethics, he brushed me aside saying that it was a small matter. Subsequently, he even allowed Stephen to submit a list of 13 potential buyers instead of the usual six (6) names. (Please see Appendix II.)
 
On 24 March 1996, after 12 days of marketing, I found a buyer. The option to purchase was granted on the same day and a 1% option money was received by the seller. Since the buyer was not on Stephen`s list, he would merely receive a reimbursement for his advertising costs.
 
On 1 April 1996, one week after I sold the property, Stephen found a buyer who was prepared to pay $10,000 more for it. Instead of liaising with me as I was then the Marketing Agent, he contacted the owner directly. With Paul`s, who is Louis` son, help and advice, the owner refunded the 1% option money to my buyer and granted another option to purchase to Stephen`s buyer. The second option was granted one week before the expiry of the first option.
 
When I received my share of commission on 20 July 1996, I was shocked that besides the usual 20% deduction by the company, another 20% was deducted making it a total of 40%. My commission basis as stated in the agency agreement was 80%/20%.
 
 When I tried to seek an explanation from Louis on the additional 20% deduction, he threw tantrum at me saying that I was childish in depriving his son, Paul, of his rightful share of commission. Reluctantly, he said that the 20% deduction was for the following:
 
1 
 10% to Paul for his help in getting the owner to grant the second option to purchase; 
 
2 
 10% to Stephen`s friend as referral fee for recommending the buyer. 
 
 From the above, it is clear that Paul has no role in this transaction. He was neither the first nor second agent. I was completely shut off from the second transaction even though I was then the Marketing Agent. Paul was an intruder in this instance. Is he entitled to `his rightful share` as his father claimed? I was completely unaware of Stephen`s referral. Is this ethical? I shall leave to you, members of the Council to decide.
 
B Making disparaging comments and lies against another agent
 
 Please refer to Appendix III for a photocopy of Louis` article in his November 1996 company`s newsletter in which he made disparaging comments and lies about me. The article read `An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired`.
 
Although no names were mentioned, there were sufficient insinuations and innuendo in the article to suggest that I was the agent he was alluding to (very clever on his part to avoid a legal suit for defamation).
 
There is a clear reference in the first sentence of the second paragraph to a 99-year leasehold landed property. It read...
 
`First Agent was marketing this two-storey Semi-D (L99)...`
 
For the whole of 1996, Louis listed only two 99-year leasehold landed properties. Both of them were marketed and sold by me, although one was subsequently aborted. A glance at the company property listings on 14 October 1996 (please see Appendix IV) showed only one landed 99-year leasehold landed property. This listing was accessible to all agents in the company. Anyway, reference to this listing is unnecessary as I was well known in the company as a `99 years man`.
 
I was appointed the first Marketing Agent for 7A Jalan Rindu on 13 May 1996. The property was sold on 18 July 1996 for $1.6m after two months of intensive marketing. However, it was aborted on 1 August 1996, on the option expiry date. Although the buyer refused to exercise the option, he asked to be informed should the owner decides to sell at $1.45m later. I informed both Louis and the owner of the buyer`s wish to buy at a much lower price and the property was given to a second agent to market.
 
On 18 October 1996, nearly two and a half months after the aborted sale, Louis informed me that the second agent, Thomas, found a buyer for $1.448m, a far cry from the earlier sale of $1.6m. 
 He asked me to lie to the vendor that my buyer was no longer interested as he wanted the second agent to close the deal. Coincidentally, Thomas is also an old friend of Louis. Naturally, I refused to abide by his request as I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. Anyway, which agent would give up an opportunity to close?
 
Feeling very sore at my refusal to accede to his request, he insisted on a three-way co-broke. I was totally taken aback as the Company`s Operations Manual states very clearly that the second Marketing Agent should receive only 10% as referral token should the buyer comes from my list which was submitted earlier.
 
Now we take a post-mortem at the disparaging remarks and lies in the article. The first sentence of the third paragraph reads ...
 
`After five weeks, a buyer was identified at $1.45m.`
 
Is it true that a buyer was found after five weeks? My buyer aborted the sale on 1August 1996 and Thomas found a buyer on 18 October 1996. That is 12 weeks and not five weeks!
 
The fourth sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`Agent 1 insisted that his buyer who first made the offer of $1.45m should be given priority.`
 
It strains logic to say that where both offers were of the same price of $1.45m my buyer should be given priority over Thomas`. The truth is Thomas` buyer only offered $1.448m and not $1.45m. My buyer`s offer was $1.45m.
 
The seventh sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`This compromise to co-broke three-way was not accepted by Agent [num ]1...`
 
Of course, I did not agree as the Company`s Operations Manual stated clearly that Thomas should receive only 10% and not 33% (three-way co-broke) in the event that the buyer comes from my list. (Please see Appendix I.) I was shocked that Louis refused to abide by what he spelt out in his Operations Manual.
 
The fifth sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`As the transaction was then at a critical stage of negotiation ...`
 
I spoke to the vendor and he said he was merely considering the offer at $1.448m as it was a big drop from the earlier aborted sale of $1.6m. He laughed when I told him Louis said that it was at a critical stage of negotiation.
 
The last second sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`the commission proceeds would be split only between Lister and himself as a matter of policy.`
 
This is preposterous as Thomas stand to receive 10% as the second Marketing Agent even though the buyer comes from my list. (Please see Appendix I.)
 
The last third sentence of third paragraph reads ...
 
`Agent [num ]1 who claimed that he had earlier spent heavily on advertising the property.`
 
 Again this is typical of Louis. He is always derisive of other people efforts. I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. He should be glad that I was willing to market this 99-year leasehold property when all other agents in the company turned it down. Up to today, I still failed to understand why he is helping his crony who was in his list of agents for only one month!
 
The first sentence of fourth paragraph reads ...
 
`As agent [num ]1 was confident that his buyer would take up the sale, agent [num ]2 had to stop further discussions with his buyer and the relevant lawyers involved.`
 
 This is outrageously untrue
. The vendor was merely considering the offer at $1.45m, a drop of $150k from the previous sale. Anyway, this is a $1.45m sale of a private property, not a sale of a commercial property like Paragon where the transaction is complicated and the sum involved hundreds of millions of dollars. Lawyers need not be involved at this stage!
 
The second sentence of last paragraph reads ...
 
`This expensive experience has cost the relevant parties $21,750.00 in commission just because of personal greed and over-confidence.`
 
This is one and a half per cent commission on a sale price of $1.45m. It defy logic to say that the owner was willing to pay one and a half per cent commission on $1.45m when in the earlier aborted sale, he was willing to pay only one per cent commission on a higher sale price of $1.6m. (Please see Appendix V.)
 
 Louis Yeap is a master at the art of puffery. Let us take a look at his latest colour brochure. In it there is a testimony by Mr Cho Jock Min.
 
 I quote: `Once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks and at the price we wanted.` (Please see Appendix VI.)
 
 Mr Cho was the owner of 26 Pasir Panjang Hill, a unique five-storey corner freehold townhose [sic]. His house was sold after two months of marketing not three weeks. How did I know? I should know as I was involved in marketing his property! Mr Cho had since emigrated to Australia.

 Letter of 20 February 
 
On 20 February 1997, in response to a letter from Messrs Sim Mong Teck & Partners on the retention by the defendant of certain articles belonging to Louis Yeap Realty, the defendant replied in terms of the letter of 20 February enclosing a copy of the letter of 8 January. Both letters were carbon copied to ASR, SISV and ASREA.
 33.The letter of 20 February, with the offending words complained of underlined, read: 
...
 
Dear Sirs
 
Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Mr Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd
 
I refer to your letter dated 13 February 1997 on the subject of return of the following items belonging to Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd.
 
(1) Operations Manual 
(2) Locker Key 
(3) Identification Badge 
(4) File containing real estate agreements
 
I am shocked and dismayed that your client, Louis Yeap had the audacity to threaten to file a police report and institute legal proceedings against me for the recovery of the above items.
 
Your client`s conduct and behavior made it difficult, if not impossible for me to return the above items to him.
 
It may interest you to note that I have on 8 January 1997, filed two complaints against your client to the Association of Singapore Realtors (`ASR`).
 
 Firstly, your client conspired with his son, Paul and his old friend and agent, Stephen Pang to deprive me of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace.
 
From the attached you can see that Paul clearly has no role in this transaction. He was neither the Lister or Marketing Agent. He was, to be precise an intruder in this instance. Yet a share of my commission was diverted to him for his `intruder` status.
 
 Secondly, your client resorted to making disparaging comments and lies against me in his November 1996 company newsletter. He is the writer of the Company`s Operations Manual in which he set out meticulously the Company`s policies. I was shocked (am still shocked) that he refused to abide by what he had spelt out in his Operations Manual.
 
Please see attached a copy of my complaint to ASR.
 
It seems your client is a law unto himself. Let me give you another concrete example of a situation where he stands defiant of his company`s policies as set out in his Operations Manual.
 
Here he refused to share the expenses in respect of a first-generation property (Liberty Warehouse) in which I successfully marketed.
 
Sixth paragraph Section E-1 of his Operations Manual reads:
 
`Should any referral/listing be received as a result of the publicity on the original Listing, the Marketing Agent & Lister will be Joint Listers on the property for the `first generation referral` only (ie only for one property referred through the original Lister`s listing). For this joint listing, publicity expenses & commission received will be shared equally (50:50).`
 
By the way the total expenses, to be shared equally between Lister and Marketing Agent is $55.62. (Please see Appendix 7).
 
I shall now touch on the subject of the return of the above items to your client.
 
Identification Badge - Your client insisted that I produce the receipt for the $20 deposit before he would refund the money to me. He refused to accept that I had mislaid the receipt.
 
Rank Xerox Photocopy Card - Your client refused to refund the balance on my photocopy card amounting to over $35.
 
File containing Real Estate Agreements - What Real Estate Agreements? Please specify. The only agreement I recalled signing is when I joined the Company as an agent.
 
I have made many attempts in resolving the above outstanding issues with your client, but he has up to date refused to settle the matter. I have no recourse but to resort to ASR for mediation.
 
Despite your client`s threat to file a police report and institute legal proceedings against me for the recovery of the above items, I will continue to exercise restraint and refrain from taking legal action unless I am forced to.
 
As regards the Operations Manual, your client still refused to accept that I had mislaid it. In the above instance, I quote from my ex-colleague`s Operations Manual. Please assure your client that I will return the Manual together with the other items as soon as I locate it.
 
Thank you for your understanding.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Signed

 The proceedings 
 
On 9 April 1997, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings. On the plaintiff`s claim, the issues were: (i). were the offending words defamatory of the plaintiff;
 (ii). if they were, were they true;
 (iii). alternatively, were the offending words fair comment or were they published on an occasion of qualified privilege;
 (iv). if it was, was it actuated by malice?
 On the defendant`s counterclaim, the issues were: (i). was the newsletter defamatory;
 (ii). if it was, could it be read and identified as referring to the defendant;
 (iii). if it could, were the contents in substance true?
 (iv). alternatively, was it published on an occasion of qualified privilege or fair comment.
 35.
 The plaintiff`s claim 
 
Whether the offending words are defamatory is one of construction according to their natural and ordinary meaning. See 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Ors
 
[1989] SLR 1063
 at 1080
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  at 399 per LP Thean J [as he then was]: 
I now turn to consider the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of in para 9 in the context of the article ...
 
The issue is one purely of construction of the words, but the rules of construction applicable in construing a contract or a will are not appropriate for the purpose. The proper approach is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons: ...
 36.I now give my construction of the natural and ordinary meaning of the offending words in the context in which they appeared: 
`Breach of code of conduct and ethics by Louis Yeap Beng San of Louis Yeap Realty Pte Ltd.
 
I have several grievances against Mr Louis Yeap, a respected and senior member of your Association.
 
Generally, the level of professionalism in the industry today is rock bottom. I have no wish to report him to IRAS, the licensing body for the Housing Agents at this moment in time as I believe that you have the power to discipline an errant member.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was unethical in his conduct as a licensed housing agent and had breached the code of conduct and ethics for housing agents.
 37.
`When I tried to seek an explanation from Louis on the additional 20% deduction, he threw a tantrum at me saying that I was childish in depriving his son, Paul of his rightful share of the commission. Reluctantly, he said that the 20% deduction was for the following:
 
1 10% to Paul for his help in getting the owner to grant the second option to purchaser. 
2 10% to Stephen`s friend as referral fee for recommending the buyer. From the above, it is clear that Paul has no role in this transaction. He was neither the first nor second Agent. I was completely shut off from the second transaction even though I was then the Marketing Agent. Paul was an intruder in this instance. Is he entitled to `his rightful share` as his father claimed? I was completely unaware of Stephen`s referral. Is this ethical? I shall leave to you, members of the Council to decide.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff conspired with Stephen Pang and his son Paul Yeap to deprive the defendant of his rightful share of the commission and also that the plaintiff had lied to the defendant in order to give Paul Yeap the 10% commission which the latter was not entitled to.
 38.
`Please refer to Appendix III for a photocopy of Louis` article in his November 1996 company`s newsletter in which he made disparaging comments and lies about me. The article read ""An example of over-confidence and greed that backfired"".`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was a liar and had unjustifiably disparaged the defendant in the newsletter.
 39.
`He asked me to lie to the vendor that my buyer was no longer interested as he wanted the second agent to close the deal. Coincidentally, Thomas is also an old friend of Louis. Naturally, I refused to abide by his request as I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. Anyway, which agent would give up an opportunity to close?`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff resorted to unethical means to ensure that his old friend Thomas Tham close the deal in place of the defendant who had incurred close to $2,000 in advertisements.
 40.
`Again this is typical of Louis. He is always derisive of other people`s efforts. I spent nearly $2,000 marketing this property. He should be glad that I was willing to market this 99-year leasehold property when all other agents in the company turned it down. Up to today, I still fail to understand why he is helping his crony who was in his list of agents for only one month!`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff never gave credit when it was due and that he favoured his crony Thomas Tham.
 41.
`This is outrageously untrue.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff had published lies in the newsletter about the defendant`s conduct in the sale of 7A Jalan Rindu.
 42.
`Louis Yeap is a master at the art of puffery. Let us take a look at his latest colour brochure. In it there is a testimony by Mr Cho Jock Min.
 
I quote: ""once again, our thanks to you for selling our house in a remarkably short period of three weeks and at the price we wanted."" Mr Cho was the owner of 26 Pasir Panjang Hill, a unique five-storey corner freehold townhouse. His house was sold after two months of marketing not three weeks. How did I know? I should know as I was involved in marketing his property! Mr Cho had since emigrated to Australia.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff is a master in exaggeration and had been deceitful in the publication of the testimony of Cho Jock Min.
 43.
`Firstly, your client conspired with his son, Paul and his old friend and agent, Stephen Pang to deprive me of approximately $900 in my share of commission on the sale of 26 Burnfoot Terrace.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff conspired with his son Paul Yeap and his old friend Stephen Pang to deprive the defendant of his full share of the commission.
 44.
`Secondly, your client resorted to making disparaging comments and lies against me in his November 1996 company newsletter.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff is a liar and made disparaging remarks against the defendant in the newsletter.
 45.
`He is the writer of the Company`s Operations Manual in which he set out meticulously the company`s policies. I was shocked (am still shocked) that he refused to abide by what he had spelt out in his Operation Manual.`
 In their natural and ordinary meaning these offending words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiff was a hypocrite and did not practise what he preached.
 46.I was therefore of the view that the offending words were defamatory of the plaintiff.
 47.Against the factual background of the sale of the four properties, the offending words are not true in substance and in fact. Accordingly the defence of justification failed.
 48.On the defence of fair comment, the comment must be based on a correct substratum of facts. Statements like `Again this is typical of Louis`; `This is outrageously untrue`; `Louis is a master at the art of puffery` could be comments but they were not based on a correct substratum of facts. The defence of fair comment therefore failed.
 49.On qualified privilege, 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) p 329, para 14.5 states: 
The occasions (of qualified) privilege can never be catalogued and rendered exact` but most privileged occasions under the common law may be very broadly classified into one of two classes: where the maker of the statement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receive it; or where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interest of his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement or where he is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient. `It may be accepted as a well-established rule that some duty or interest must exist in the party to whom the communication is made as well as in the party making it. The duty or interest may be common to both parties, but this is not essential. It is enough if there is a duty or interest on one side, and a duty or interest, or interest or duty (whether common or corresponding or not) on the other.`
 It is not clear as to what interest ASR and its members, SISV and ASREA have in the letter of 8 January and letter of 20 February addressed to them by the defendant. The licensing body for real estate agents is the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. In any case, although the plaintiff is a member of ASR and ASREA, he is not a member of SISV. SISV therefore can have no interest in the publication.
 50.Additionally `malice defeats the defences of qualified privilege and fair comment.` See 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
, p 424, para 16.1. See also p 427 at para 16.4: 
 Malice as `improper` or `indirect` motive
. The plaintiff will succeed in proving the existence of express malice if he can show that the defendant was not using the occasion honestly for the purpose for which the law gives protection. But was actuated by some indirect motive not connected with the privilege.
 51.The publication was clearly actuated by malice on the part of the defendant. This was what the defendant said under cross-examination: 
Q: You said you cc this letter addressed to us [referring to plaintiff`s solicitors] to ASR, SISV and ASREA because we threatened to lodge a police report for loss of items belonging to the company which were in your possession or custody? 
A: Yes. That is one of the reasons. Another reason is plaintiff is petty. See PBD/87. He refused to refund me my $20 unless I produced the deposit receipt. Another reason is Rank Xerox photocopy card. He refused to refund my money for the stored value card which card was returned to him. Another reason he refused to pay me $27.81 for plaintiff`s share in some advertisements.
 52.Accordingly I found for the plaintiff and awarded him $40,000 by way of damages and costs.
 53.On the defendant`s counterclaim, the newsletter was an in-house publication. Circulation was confined to the agents of Louis Yeap Realty. It was based on the abortive sale of the leasehold property at 7A Jalan Rindu. The defendant was not named. He was one of the five agents who had marketed this property unsuccessfully. With such a limited circulation and with five marketing agents involved in this property, only those with knowledge of the facts would have read the newsletter as published of the defendant. See 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (9th Ed) p 163, para 7.3: 
 Statement capable of referring to the plaintiff.
 The statement must `identify` the plaintiff, that is to say, it must be capable of referring to him. The issue of identification is to be decided on principles similar to those which govern the question of whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning. Where the plaintiff is expressly identified by name, it is not necessary to produce evidence to prove that anyone to whom the statement was published did identify the plaintiff. The question is not whether anyone did identify the plaintiff but whether persons who were acquainted with the plaintiff could identify him from the words used. Thus if a local newspaper in Cornwall publishes a false story to the effect that `John Smith of 24 Acacia Avenue, Carlisle, has been convicted of fraud` that is actionable by John Smith even though there is no evidence that anyone who knew him read the story. Where the plaintiff is referred to in an indirect way or by implication it will be a question of degree how far evidence will be required to connect the libel with him. At one extreme, if there is a libel on `the Prime Minister` that officer does not need to produce witnesses to testify that they know who he is. 
 At the other extreme, the plaintiff may only be identifiable by reason of extrinsic facts which are not generally known, in which case there is no actionable publication unless it is shown that the words were communicated to persons with such knowledge. Even in the latter type of case, however, it is not enough that the recipients of the statement did understand it to refer to the plaintiff: the issue is whether reasonable people with their knowledge would so understand it
. [Emphasis added.]
 54.In 
 Consolidated Trust Co Ltd v Browne 
 (1948) 49 SR(NSW) 86, a cyclostyled statement prepared by the defendant headed `Things I hear. For the confidential information of subscribers, a privately circulated digest for busy people.` The only persons defamed were identified as `the new owners of a block of flats, 57 Darlinghurst Road, who owned Birtley Towers as well.`
 55.The plaintiff`s action was dismissed. In dismissing the plaintiff`s appeal Jordan CJ stated at pp 91-92: 
The article complained of contained matter capable of being regarded as defamatory of persons of whose identity the only indication given in the article is that they are `the new owners (of 57 Darlinghurst Road) who own Birtley Towers as well`. It was proved in evidence that one of the plaintiffs owned 57 Darlinghurst Road and the other owned Birtley Towers. But the only evidence of publication was an admission that the defendant published the matter complained of, it not being stated how or to whom. This was evidently not intended, and in argument has not been treated, as an admission that the article came to the notice of someone who knew that one plaintiff was the owner of 57 Darlinghurst Road and the other the owner of Birtley Towers (and therefore allegedly also the owner of 57 Darlinghurst Road). It was treated as an admission only that the article came to the notice of at least some one person. The argument submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs is that so long as it is a legitimate inference from the facts that some people must have known that the plaintiffs were the owners of these premises respectively, it was unnecessary to prove that the article came to the notice of at least one of these people. In the absence of anything in the evidence to suggest that the identity of the owners of the buildings in question was a matter of such general notoriety that it could fairly be presumed that anybody to whose notice the article came would know who it was that was referred to as the owner, I am of the opinion that this argument is unsound. The position then is that the article is incapable of being regarded as defamatory of the plaintiffs except by persons who had knowledge of special circumstances, namely, that one of them owned one block of flats and the other another, and there is no evidence that it was published to anyone who possess that knowledge.
 There is no evidence that the newsletter was circulated to persons with knowledge of the facts relating to the abortive sale of 7A Jalan Rindu and that reasonable people with knowledge of the facts would understand it to refer to the defendant.
 56.Alternatively, the contents of the newsletter are true and the plaintiff is entitled to rely on the defence of justification. There was a slight inaccuracy in the statement that the second agent, that is Stephen Pang, found a buyer at $1,450,000. He found a buyer at only $1,448,000. Such slight inaccuracy does not disentitle the plaintiff to the defence of justification. See Gatley supra at p 239, para 11.8: 
 Inaccuracy of detail.
 Again, if the defendant can prove that the main charge or gist of the libel is true, a slight inaccuracy in one or more of its details will not prevent him from succeeding in a defence of justification.
 57.It was my view that the publication was also protected by the alternative defence of fair comment and qualified privilege.
 58.Accordingly, I dismissed the defendant`s counterclaim with costs.",1999-02-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
 
 
KARTHIGESU JA
 (delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 18 years and caning with 24 strokes for the offence of robbery punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) by Choo Han Teck JC. He appealed against the sentence. We reduced the term of imprisonment to 12 years and confirmed the imposition of the punishment of caning with 24 strokes. We now give our reasons.
 2.
 The facts 
 
The appellant, Roslan bin Abdul Rahman, had an accomplice, Ali bin Abdullah. The deceased victim was one Chia Siew Hiew, a 74 year old woman. Prior to her demise, she resided alone in Blk 45 Bedok South Road [num ]10-791.
 3.Sometime in June 1997, the appellant was in desperate need of cash. The accomplice suggested to the appellant that he should steal from the deceased. He informed the appellant that the deceased would water her plants outside her flat at a particular time every morning and that the appellant could sneak into her flat at that time. The appellant then observed the behaviour of the deceased and found that there was indeed such a pattern.
 4.On 23 June 1997, the appellant, acting on the accomplice`s suggestion, sneaked into the deceased`s flat whilst she was watering her plants and hid in her bedroom. When the deceased returned to her bedroom, she spotted the appellant and started screaming. She tried to escape but the appellant grabbed her. The appellant then used his hands to cover her mouth and dragged her back into the room.
 5.When the appellant released her, she attempted to escape from the room again. A struggle ensued and in the course of the struggle, the deceased fell and hit her face against the edge of the bed and the floor. She suffered bruises on her cheeks and forehead, as well as some fractures around the area of her right eye and her nose. She lost consciousness but was (according to the appellant) still alive.
 6.The appellant took a small towel and stuffed it into her mouth to stop her from screaming when she regained consciousness. He ransacked the room and stole about $4,000 in cash, two gold rings and a gold bracelet. The appellant then wiped everything he had touched with one of his socks before leaving the flat.
 7.On 24 June 1998, the adopted son of the deceased discovered her and called the police. The deceased was subsequently pronounced dead. On 25 June 1998, a post-mortem revealed the cause of death was asphyxia due to gagging.
 8.On 6 July 1998, the appellant was charged as follows: 
That you, Roslan bin Abdul Rahman, on 23 June 1997, at or about 6am, at Block 45, Bedok South Road [num ]10-791, Singapore, did commit robbery of the following properties:
 
(i) cash of $4,000, 
(ii) two gold rings valued at $50 each, and 
(iii) one gold bracelet valued at $150,
 
with a total value of $4,250, in possession of one Chia Siew Hiew, and whilst committing the said robbery, did cause grievous hurt to the said Chia Siew Hiew, to wit, by causing her to suffer fractures around the area of her right eye and on her nose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 The appellant pleaded guilty to the above charge.
 9.
 The decision below 
 
The appellant was not represented by counsel at the trial below. The appellant admitted the offence and the statement of facts which was read out. He pleaded for leniency. The deputy public prosecutor then addressed the court and pressed for a deterrent sentence. In his address the deputy public prosecutor drew the court`s attention to the appellant`s antecedents, all of which related to the consumption of drugs and detentions at drug rehabilitation centres. He drew attention to the particular facts of this case where the appellant had preyed on a very old woman who was quite helpless in defending herself and referred to police statistics which showed that property offences involving victims of 60 years and above were on the increase. Finally, the deputy public prosecutor submitted that there was a correlation between an accused person`s drug background and the crime committed by them. He referred to certain statistics in support and after referring in detail to the appellant`s `long history of drug abuse` and detentions at drug rehabilitation centres which went as far back as 1977, concluded his address to the court on sentence with these words: 
The accused has therefore maintained his drug activities throughout the last 20 years and because of the correlation between such a background and the commission of property offences ..., offenders like him must be deterred effectively by meting out a harsh sentence.
 The appellant was then sentenced to imprisonment for the term of 18 years and caning with 24 strokes in accordance with s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 10.
 The appeal 
 
On appeal, the appellant, who appeared in person, contended that the trial judge erred in taking into consideration his drug-related antecedents and that the sentence pronounced was manifestly excessive.
 11.The applicable laws are s 394 and s 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). For easy reference, we have set out the provisions below.Section 394 of the Penal Code reads: 
Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery.
 
394 If any person, in committing or in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and any other person, jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit such robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 stokes.
 Section 397 of the Penal Code reads: 
Robbery when armed or with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.
 
397 If at the time of committing or attempting to commit robbery, the offender is armed with or uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, such offender shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes, in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable under any other section of this Code.
 12.The offence of committing armed robbery with hurt, with which the appellant was charged, carried the punishment of a mandatory minimum caning of 24 strokes under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code. The combined effect of these two provisions effectively removed the court`s discretion to decrease the number of strokes of the cane. It followed that this part of the appeal naturally failed. In passing it will be remembered that under s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code the maximum number of strokes of the cane permitted is 24. Hence in this case the minimum number of strokes was also the maximum.
 13.The next issue was whether we should reduce the term of imprisonment. In the present case the learned trial judge was right to regard the offence of armed robbery with hurt as a very serious offence meriting a deterrent sentence due to the prevalence of this type of offence.
 14.The learned trial judge gave no reasons in support of the sentence he imposed. The appellant`s final plea was that this was his first criminal offence as the others were drug-related offences. This plea was ignored. It seemed to us that the learned trial judge was influenced by the prosecution`s submission and took into account the appellant`s drug-related antecedents. The learned trial judge had proceeded on wrong principles. The appellant`s drug-related antecedents should have no bearing on the present trial as it was completely unrelated to the offence the appellant was charged with. The appellant had no antecedents of offences related to the type of offence he was charged with. The fact that the appellant was a drug addict did not necessarily imply that he was more prone to commit the offence of armed robbery with hurt.
 15.Bearing this in mind, we considered the sentence of 18 years` imprisonment to be inappropriate and unduly excessive. We therefore quashed that sentence and substituted for it a sentence of 12 years` imprisonment. Accordingly, the sentence was reduced to 12 years` imprisonment and caning with 24 strokes.",1999-02-01 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant claimed trial in the district court to 23 amended charges of abetment of cheating under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one amended charge of abetment of attempted cheating under s 420 read with ss 109 and 511. At the close of the trial, he was convicted by the district judge. He also elected to plead guilty to a charge of affray under s 160 of the Penal Code, which had been stood down during the trial of the cheating charges. Having heard his mitigation plea, the district judge sentenced him to nine years` preventive detention. The appellant appealed against this sentence as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed his appeal and, further, exercised my discretion under s 256(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code to enhance the sentence to one of 20 years` preventive detention. I now give my reasons in writing.
 2.
 The background facts 
 
By way of background, I set out below the first of the 24 cheating charges to which the appellant claimed trial. This first charge serves as a sample of the other charges, as all 24 charges alleged largely similar acts: 
You, Heng Jong Cheng, M/57 years, NRIC No S1091887A are charged that you, on or about 25 October 1997, at about 10am, at Blk 846, Yishun Ring Road, [num ]01-3667, M/s First Pawnshop Pte Ltd, Singapore, did abet one Chua Mei Chern by instigating her to cheat one Wong Ngiam Khong by taking a silver bracelet plated with gold and pawning it as a gold bracelet to the said Wong Ngiam Khong for the value of $1,550, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced the said Wong Ngiam Khong to deliver to the said Chua Mei Chern the said sum of $1,550, which he would not have done so had he not been so deceived, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 3.The other charges differed mainly in terms of the particulars as to the date and place of the offence, the identity of the victim and the amount of money involved. In committing these offences, the appellant had two accomplices, one Chua Mei Chern and one Loy Hui Huat. Both Chua and Loy were approached by the appellant to assist him in the scam. The scheme called for Chua and Loy to visit various pawnshops with silver bracelets which had been gold-plated and which they represented to the pawnshop operators as solid gold bracelets. The proceeds received from the pawnshops were apparently turned over to the appellant who then paid off Chua and Loy for their pains.
 4.The appellant, for his part, denied any involvement in the whole scam and claimed to have been `wrongfully` accused. At the close of the trial, the district judge found the evidence against the appellant `overwhelming` and convicted him accordingly.
 5.As for the affray charge, to which the appellant pleaded guilty, this involved a fight between the appellant and the male accomplice Loy at a void deck.
 6.
 The appellant`s mitigation and antecedents 
 
In making his mitigation plea after his conviction, the appellant referred to his age as well as the poor health of his wife. He also said that he had not committed any offence since his last conviction in court in 1993 and added that he had `turned over a new leaf`. This attempt to portray himself as a reformed character was somewhat hampered by the revelation of a lengthy list of antecedents to which he himself admitted. These antecedents indicated an illustrious career in crime, spanning over three decades and encompassing, in particular, numerous offences involving dishonesty. As an example, I need set out only those convictions sustained in the 1990s. In February 1991 the appellant was convicted of two charges of housebreaking and theft by night. A third, similar charge was taken into consideration and he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 24 months` imprisonment each. Shortly after having completed these terms of imprisonment, the appellant made another appearance in the district court in 1993, charged on this occasion with 15 counts of assisting in the concealment or disposal of stolen property. He was eventually convicted of three out of these 15 counts, with the remaining charges being taken into consideration during sentencing. Three terms of imprisonment were imposed, each of a duration of two years and six months; and two of these terms ran consecutively. This meant that the appellant had been out of prison for only a short period of time before he took to the cheating scam described in the preceding paragraphs.
 7.
 The appeal 
 
On appeal before me, despite this being an appeal against sentence only, the appellant repeated the same allegations he had made in the trial below: namely, that he had not committed any of the cheating offences; and that he had been `fixed up` by Loy who owed him money over horse-racing bets. I had no hesitation in dismissing these allegations. They were considered by the district judge in the course of a three-day trial in which the appellant was afforded every opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, including Loy. The district judge eventually concluded that the appellant`s allegations of a `fix-up` were baseless and I found nothing at all in the evidence to suggest otherwise. If anything, the appellant`s continued protestations of a `fix-up` demonstrated an obstinate refusal to accept responsibility for the offences committed. The only other thing he had to say in support of his appeal was that he would `turn over a new leaf`, which claim I found difficult, if not impossible, to believe.
 8.I was faced, then, with an offender who had evinced a complete lack of remorse and whose record indicated that he was highly likely to return to a life of crime once he was released from detention. His various encounters with the criminal law since 1958 appeared to have taught him nothing. Even on occasions where he was merely fined for offences such as the dishonest receipt of stolen property, he failed to take advantage of the `second chance` given: indeed, if his record was anything to go by, he went on to thumb his nose at the law by committing almost exactly the same kind of offences in an even greater number. Having attained the age of 57 years, he had apparently managed to avoid learning any useful skills other than those of a habitual criminal. Shortly before the perpetration of the cheating scam in 1997, he was (on his own evidence) operating as an illegal bookmaker.
 9.Having regard to the above factors, I found the appellant`s appeal against sentence to be without merit. In fact, far from being manifestly excessive, a term of nine years` preventive detention appeared to me to be manifestly inadequate to protect the public from the menace constituted by the appellant. Given the average life expectancy of an adult man these days, even if the appellant is released from detention at age 66, he would have a good number of years left in which to make mischief; and if, after a lifetime spent in and out of the criminal courts, he had made no effort to quell his criminal inclinations at age 57, I had grave doubts that he would do so even after being released at age 66. Moreover, one could scarcely affect a dewy-eyed optimism about the sort of opportunities which would be available to the appellant on re-entering society at age 66. As I have pointed out, he appeared to have no useful skills with which to support himself; and once released at age 66, with his record of previous convictions, it was highly improbable that he would find a foothold in the competitive workplace of today. Left to his own devices, it seemed to me he might well find himself floundering in poorer conditions than those prevailing in detention; and this, in turn, would only fuel his tendency towards unlawful means of livelihood.
 10.In the circumstances, I considered a protracted period of preventive detention to be in the best interests not only of the public but also of the appellant himself. Accordingly, I dismissed his appeal and enhanced the period of preventive detention to the maximum term of 20 years.",1999-03-16 00:00:00,SG High Court

This was an appeal against the decision of the assistant registrar given on 9 March 1987 in which, on an application under O 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court by the plaintiffs for judgment, he gave the defendants unconditional leave to defend the action.
The plaintiffs` claim is for a sum of $340,818.67, being the balance of the price of diamonds and gems sold and delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendants. There was no dispute on the amount owing, as the defendants admitted the claim. However, the defendants contended that the contracts for the sale of diamonds and gems to them were tainted with illegality and the illegality arose in this way. The plaintiffs were well aware that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants were meant for sale in Peninsular Malaysia and that they were to be taken there without any declaration and payment of customs duty due to the Malaysian authority. The defendants maintained that the modus operandi in the sale and delivery of the diamonds was `a joint illegal enterprise` and a director of the plaintiffs, Pradip Ramanlal Shah, `knew and was privy to this joint illegal enterprise`. That was the only defence raised and it was submitted on behalf of the defendants that that was a triable issue. The learned assistant registrar, who heard the application, gave unconditional leave to the defendants to defend the action and against that decision, the appeal was brought. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, I varied the decision of the learned assistant registrar and ordered that leave be given to the defendants to defend the action on condition that the defendants furnished a bank guarantee for the sum of $340,818.67 within 21 days from the date thereof, in default of which the plaintiffs would be at liberty to enter final judgment against the defendants for the sum claimed with interest and costs.
In seeking to set up the defence of illegality, Mohamed Yusoof s/o Mohamed Dawood, a director of the defendants, in his affidavit affirmed on 4 November 1986 said, inter alia, as follows: 
 
9 The plaintiffs were well aware that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants were meant for sale in Peninsular Malaysia.
 
 
 
 
(10) The plaintiffs were well aware that the said diamonds and gems were being taken into Peninsular Malaysia without declaration and payment of the customs dues due to the Malaysian authorities. 
 
(11) The modus operandi of the sale and delivery between the plaintiffs and defendants was a joint illegal enterprise. The said Pradip Ramanlal Shah knew and was privy to this joint illegal enterprise.
  
 
 
Mohamed Yusoof then proceeded to show how he took delivery of the diamonds and gems from the plaintiffs. He said that he went to the plaintiffs` premises, collected the diamonds and gems under consignment notes, and then brought them to Malaysia and sold them there, and that those, which were unsold were returned to the plaintiffs, who would then invoice and bill the defendants only for those diamonds and gems which were sold. That was the modus operandi in the sale of all the diamonds comprised in the 13 invoices set out in para 1 of the statement of claim, except for five lots of diamonds, in respect of which, he said this: 
 
21 As suggested and advised by Pradip Ramanlal Shah these lots were exported legally from Singapore into Peninsular Malaysia in order to give an air of legality to the entire transactions. When they were so exported the packing was done in the plaintiffs` office under the supervision of Pradip Ramanlal Shah. The preparation of all the documents for the export was also done by the plaintiffs but on the defendants` invoices. This was done by the plaintiffs` clerk named Nadirah.
 
 
 
He then said that the plaintiffs were fully aware of the entire transaction and that the diamonds and gems were smuggled into Peninsular Malaysia for sale there.
An examination of the allegations contained in the affidavit does not really show that there was `a joint illegal enterprise` and that the plaintiffs were `privy to this joint illegal enterprise`. The defendants admitted there were sales of diamonds and gems to them and that the sales were on consignment: the plaintiffs billed for only those items sold by the defendants. The sales and delivery took place in Singapore. They were exported by the defendants to Malaysia for sale by them, and in taking them across to Malaysia the defendants committed the illegal acts under the laws there: they smuggled the diamonds and gems into Malaysia without payment of customs duty. There was no suggestion that the plaintiffs` servants or agents in any way took part in the smuggling or assisted in the smuggling. The plaintiffs might be well aware of such illegal acts of the defendants, their servants or agents. But mere knowledge on the part of the plaintiffs that the diamonds and gems sold to the defendants would be exported illegally by the defendants to Malaysia does not constitute a defence to the claim by the plaintiffs.

The defendant, on an application under O 14, claimed that it was an express term of the contract that the goods would be invoiced as `parts for a rolling mill`, and the purpose, as the plaintiffs well knew, was to cause a false invoice to be put up so as to enable the press extrusion plant to be imported to Lebanon contrary to Lebanese law. The defendant therefore claimed that the contract was tainted with illegality. This defence was dismissed on an application under O 14 and leave to defend on this point was refused. The refusal on this ground was confirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal. Lord Denning said that in order for such a defence to succeed, the d efendant must show two things: he must show, firstly, that the contract contained a term that the English manufacturers were to give a false invoice, and, secondly, that the English company were implicated in illegality in that they had knowledge of it and actively participated in it. He said, at p 362: 
 
In the second place, even if it were a term, the defendant would have to show that the English company were implicated in this illegality, that is, that they had knowledge of it and were actively participating in it: see

 referred to by Lord Denning, is as follows: 
 
... In my view the present position of the law is that the mere fact that a vendor of goods knows that the purchaser proposes to run them into a country where they are prohibited by some revenue law is not sufficient to render the contract of sale illegal, but if beyond mere knowledge the vendor actively engages in an adventure to get the goods into such country, the Court will not assist the parties to the adventure by entertaining or settling any dispute between the parties arising out of the contract.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, having examined the allegations made by Mohamed Yusoof s/o Mohamed Dawood in his affidavits, there was really little or no substance in the suggested defence. The allegations by him of the `joint illegal enterprise` and of the plaintiffs being `privy to this joint illegal enterprise` were merely bald statements without any facts or evidence to support them. This is almost one of those cases where summary judgment should be ordered. However, in order not to shut the defendants out from such defence, I gave to the defendants conditional leave to defend.
As regards the condition I imposed, I do not think it is unfair or unreasonable to the defendants. They are still carrying on a diamond business and they or their directors should be able to arrange for a bank guarantee. There was no evidence that they could not do so. They had taken the diamonds and gems from the plaintiffs and had sold them, and had the benefit of such sales.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This was an appeal from the decision of Rajah J wherein he found the appellants wholly liable for the injuries suffered by the respondent while at work in the course of her employment in the laundry room at the appellants` hotel. At the end of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal for the reasons that appear below. 
 The facts 
The facts of this case may be stated shortly. The respondent had been educated in a Chinese school which she had left after completing her secondary four education. She then went through a series of jobs, none of which required much skill, before joining the appellants in July 1977 as a laundry operator. At the date of the accident on 17 June 1983 she was about 34 years of age.
The appellants` hotel employed about 40 laundry operators who were divided into two sections, namely, the washing and the ironing sections. The respondent was employed in the latter and her duties included the ironing of bedsheets, pillow cases, towels and clothes. The laundry operators were also divided into senior and junior operators and at the time of the accident the respondent was considered a senior operator. The operators were supervised by a laundry supervisor who in turn reported to the manager in charge of the laundry room. The laundry manager was assisted on the technical side by an assistant engineer who in turn was assisted by two laundry technicians.
The respondent did her ironing work on pressing machines and there were several different models in the laundry room and they were all operated differently. According to the respondent, she did not receive any formal training when she joined the appellants. She was not placed on any training course nor was she given any instructions by the supervisor as to how to operate the machines. She learnt on the job from her fellow operators and this method of training workers continued right up to the date of the accident, with the respondent, as a senior operator, having some responsibility for training new operators. The allegation of the lack of formal training for laundry operators was denied by one Baldev Singh who was the laundry manager at the material time. He had joined the appellants in 1973 as a trainee supervisor and had been promoted to an assistant laundry manager by 1975. He then left to join another hotel before rejoining the appellants in 1981 as a laundry manager. According to him, all new operators who joined the appellants in 1977 were placed on a two-week training programme conducted by the supervisor or the manager. The learned judge did not indicate which version he believed. In view of the fact that Baldev Singh was not employed by the appellants when the respondent joined the hotel in 1977, we were inclined to prefer the respondent`s evidence as to the lack of formal training for operators. We also found it crucial, for reasons that appear below, that, even if the version given by Baldev Singh was true, the formal training was sadly lacking in the important aspect of educating the laundry operators on the safe operation of the pressing machine. Baldev Singh said in his evidence: 
 
... We normally do not highlight the safety features of the machines because they come with safety features. Because of the presence of safety features we do not tell them what not to do. We teach them to operate the machine.
 
 
 
The accident occurred when the respondent was pressing a T-shirt on a hot steam press machine made by a company known as Ibis Hoffman (`the laundry press`). In order to press a T-shirt, the respondent would normally have placed it on the top of the ironing board and then lowered a cover piece known as the head buck on to the ironing board. As designed by the manufacturer, the head buck would be lowered when two black buttons on the right side of the laundry press were simultaneously depressed together with a green button on the left side. This simultaneous action kept both of the operator`s hands away from the ironing board as the head buck was lowered and prevented any possibility of the operator`s hands coming into contact with the head buck. This was important as the head buck was heated and it was not disputed that the three button system was the safety feature of the laundry press machines. After the head buck was lowered, the operator would then release steam by using either a hand pedal or a foot pedal or both. After pressing the garment, the operator would release the head buck by depressing a red button on the side of the machine.
Unfortunately, as we shall see later, this system as designed by the manufacturer had been altered and, on the day of the accident, when she had placed the T-shirt on the top of the ironing board and was smoothening out the material with her right hand, the head buck came down suddenly. The heat of the head buck scalded her right hand badly. Her efforts to raise the head buck by pressing the release button failed as that button would only work if the head buck was flat on the top of the affixed piece. As a result, the respondent`s hand was stuck under the head buck for around ten minutes and the consequential injury has substantially reduced the function of her right hand. It was also said that the respondent was self-conscious of the disfigured hand and suffered from reactive depression and a severely restricted social life as a result.
The respondent subsequently brought this action against the appellants for damages for the injuries suffered, alleging that the injuries were caused by an unsafe system. This unsafe system was said to have been brought about by an alteration to the original two-handed operation (described above) of the laundry press and this alteration was alleged to have been in breach of the appel` common law duties as employers in that they had:
 
 
(a) failed to take any or any adequate precautions for the respondent`s safety at work; 
 
(b) exposed the respondent to a risk of injury they had or ought to have foreseen; 
 
(c) caused the alteration that resulted in an unsafe system; 
 
(d) allowed the laundry press to be operated when it was unsafe to do so; or 
 
(e) failed to provide a safe or proper system of work.
  
 
 
Further, or alternatively, the respondent alleged that the appellants were in breach of the statutory duties imposed on them by the equivalent of the present ss 20, 21 and 22 of the Factories Act (Cap 104) (`the Act`).
In their defence, the appellants denied that the system of work they provided to the respondent was unsafe. They also denied all knowledge of the alteration and alleged that if the system of work had been altered, it had been altered without their authority, and the respondent was one of the workers who caused or consented to the alteration. Further, or alternatively, the appellants contended that the respondent had been contributorily negligent and/or in breach of her statutory duty under the present ss 80 and 81 of the Act. The appellants also pleaded the defence of volenti non fit injuria.
The evidence as to the alteration to the laundry press was that sometime in February 1983, several of the laundry operators had approached one Michael Tan, one of the laundry technicians, to see if he could alter the laundry press to make it work faster. He complied but reverted to the original system a few days later when the pneumatic compressor on the modified press did not work properly. Subsequently, two or three months before the accident, he again altered the laundry press at the request of several operators by rewiring it so that the head buck would be lowered by depressing only the red button, thus enabling the laundry press to be operated with only one hand, leaving the other hand free. Under the altered system, the head buck would be released when one of the black buttons was depressed. The laundry press was operated by this altered system at the time of the accident. The evidence also showed that although the respondent was not one of the workers who requested the alteration, she knew of it and had worked the altered operation on many occasions before the accident without any discomfort.
The learned judge found the appellants to have been in breach of their duty to maintain a safe system of work. In his view, they could not delegate their duty to Michael Tan and they would have discovered the alteration had they exercised proper care and supervision. In the learned judge`s words: 
 
The alteration to the safe system had taken place two or three months before the accident. There were two or three supervisors and yet they were not aware that the machine had been tampered with. They did not stop the plaintiff [the respondent] from operating [the] machine. I think they ought to have known that the machine was defective.
 
 
 
The learned judge rejected the defences of contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria and accordingly found the appellants wholly liable and gave the respondent interlocutory judgment, with damages to be assessed if the parties could not agree on the quantum of damages. The appellants appealed to this court.
 Contributory negligence
At the hearing before us, the appellants did not seek to dispute the question of liability. Their appeal was solely against the learned judge`s rejection of their claim that the respondent was in some way contributorily negligent. Counsel for the appellants contended that a reasonable person in the respondent`s position would have acted differently in that a reasonable person would have reported the alteration by Michael Tan to the manager of the laundry room. Counsel also sought to show that because the respondent had continued working on the laundry press despite knowing that the altered operation was dangerous, it was an inevitable conclusion that she had been contributorily negligent.
We were unable to accept the assertion that the respondent knew that the modified operation was dangerous. The relevant portion of the evidence as to her state of knowledge occurred in her evidence in cross-examination and this read: 
 
After the modification in February 1983 I had used the modified machine. Except for the modification the functions of the machine were the same. I just carried on with the work. I did not feel discomfort operating the modified machine. As the machine was working well, I was happy to use it. My other colleagues were also operating the machine. We had no complaint about the modification ... The safest method is to use both hands before the head buck could come down or be released. Under the first [ie unmodified] system I would have to use both hands to release the head buck. Under the modified system I did not have to use both hands simultaneously. So it was unsafe and dangerous ... I did not find out why the modification was done. I did not then know it was dangerous not to work on both hands.
 
 
 
It was our view that a fair reading of the quoted passages showed that it was only on hindsight that the respondent knew that the modified operation was dangerous. In addition to the language of the quoted passages, it was also significant that the safety feature of the laundry press had never been highlighted to the operators in general and the respondent in particular. This was clear from the lack of formal training or, alternatively, from the failure of the appellants, as shown by the evidence of Baldev Singh, to educate the operators on the safety features of the machines on which they did their work. Since the respondent had never known the safety feature of the machine, she could not possibly have realized that it had been removed. We should further add that there was a particular feature of the workings of the laundry press which was not explained to and therefore not within the knowledge of the respondent. It was that the head buck could not be released at all unless it was resting on a completely flat surface. This feature was responsible for the respondent`s hand being stuck against the head buck and burnt for ten minutes.
Since the respondent did not subjectively know that the altered operation was dangerous, we considered whether a reasonable person in her position would have recognized the danger. The answer to such a question naturally depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Here, the modification was made by a technician in the appellants` employ. This was a person who was responsible for the machinery in the laundry room and it would have been reasonable for the respondent to have relied on his judgment as to the operation of the machine. This was especially so given the education level of the respondent which could be taken as fairly representative of the average education level of the laundry operators. In view of this, we thought that it would not be reasonable to have expected her to have known of the danger posed by the altered system. We were also of the view that it would be unrealistic to expect an operator in the respondent`s position to have dissented vigorously and have stopped work or have complained to the laundry manager or assistant engineer. We did not think that it was reasonable to expect an operator to make an adverse report against someone higher than her in the hierarchy of the organization, least of all when the subject matter of the report was a mechanical matter in which even the laundry manager was assisted by the technician. We found the principle set out by the House of Lords in the well-known case of 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, cited on behalf of the respondent, helpful with regard to this aspect of the appeal. The decision concerned whether an employer could rely on the defence of volenti non fit injuria where the employee knew of the danger involved in the work undertaken. The principle is well summarized in the headnote to the report: 
 
When an employee undertakes to do work which is intrinsically dangerous notwithstanding that reasonable care has been taken to render it as little dangerous as possible he voluntarily subjects himself to the risks inevitably accompanying it, and, if he suffers, the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria is open to his employer in defence to any claim made by him. But where a risk to the employee has been created or enhanced by the negligence of the employer in not providing a safe system of work the mere continuance by the employee in his service with knowledge of the risk does not preclude the employee, if he suffers from such negligence, from recovering in respect of the employer`s breach of duty. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employee undertakes, among them is not to be numbered the risk of the employer`s negligence and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered, unless the employee specially agrees to take that risk.
 
 
 
The latter part of the principle was relevant here and the rationale for that part was stated by Lord Herschell in the following terms (at p 88): 
 
Where, then, a risk to the employed, which may or may not result in injury, has been created or enhanced by the negligence of the employer, does the mere continuance in service, with knowledge of the risk, preclude the employed, if he suffers from such negligence, from recovering in respect of his employer`s breach of duty? I cannot assent to the proposition that the maxim volenti non fit injuria applies to such a case, and that the employer can invoke its aid to protect him from liability for his wrong. It is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employed undertakes, among them is certainly not to be numbered the risk of the employer`s negligence, and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered. If, then, the employer thus fails in his duty towards the employed, I do not think that because he does not straightaway refuse to continue his service, it is true to say that he is willing that his employer should thus act towards him. I believe it would be contrary to fact to assert that he either invites or assents to the act or default which he complains of as a wrong, and I know of no principle of law which compels the conclusion that the maxim volenti non fit injuria becomes applicable.
 
 
 
We agreed with the rationale stated and were of the view that, although it was stated in the context of the defence of volenti non fit injuria, the rationale was of value, in most cases, to the defence of contributory negligence as well. In our view, the mere continuance in a dangerous situation created by the employer after the commencement of employment does not require of an employee an alertness out of proportion with the status of his job. It would not be fair to expect him to assume the responsibility of supervision which rightfully falls on the employer. The obligation cast upon the employee is to take such degree of care as a reasonperson in his position would take for his own safety and in determining what a reasonable person would do, a court has to look at the average level of education of an employee in that particular job and the status of that particular job. Where the status of the job imposes no duty of supervision, and the employee has neither the educational qualifications nor the training to appreciate the dangers of his work, the law does not impose upon him the obligation which counsel for the appellants argued for.
Counsel for the appellants argued that the decision in 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, was decided at a time when the employee was not knowledgable about machines and work procedure and that the decision in 
 Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd v Shatwell 
, indicated an acknowledgment by the same court that workers have to bear a certain amount of responsibility for their own safety. The decision in 
 Shatwell 
, was, of course, a significant development, as it recognized that the defence of volenti non fit injuria could be successfully raised, in certain circumstances, against a claim based on a breach of statutory duty when it had been thought that the defence was not applicable to such a claim. The circumstances were, however, very limited: an employer could rely on the defence where his liability was vicarious and the plaintiff employee had combined with the employee at fault to deliberately disobey the statutory rule. It ought to be observed that, in 
 Shatwell 
, the employees were of the same employment status and it was perfectly sensible that an employer should not be liable in those circumstances. Moreover the House of Lords in 
 Shatwell 
, did not disapprove of 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
; in fact, their Lordships quoted from the judgments in the latter with approval and did not indicate that they were in any way departing from the decision in that case. Counsel for the appellants was also unable to cite any authorities criticising or departing from 
 Smith v Baker & Sons 
, and we were not convinced that the economic realities of work have changed significantly enough to undermine the basis of the principle.
Counsel for the appellants also drew our attention to the fact that about a month before the accident, the laundry manager, after discovering that someone had stuck a comb to one of the buttons on a machine in the laundry room, had warned the technicians not to alter the machines. We did not find this fact of much relevance in considering whether the respondent was contributorily negligent, simply because it did not show that the respondent knew that the technicians had been warned not to alter the machines nor did it show that she knew of the dangers of tampering with the machine. If the incident was at all of relevance, it would have been adverse to the appellants as it clearly emphasized the need for constant and proper supervision.
Counsel for the appellants also cited the cases of 
 Stavely Iron and Chemical Co Ltd v Jones 
, and 
 Williams v Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Co Ltd & Ors 
, in support of his submissions. We did not find them of much assistance. In 
 Stavely Iron and Chemical Co Ltd v Jones 
, the House of Lords doubted if the principle set out in the case of 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd 
, that `... it is not for every risky thing which a workman in a factory may do in familiarity with the machinery that a plaintiff ought to be held guilty of contributory negligence ...` applied to a simple case of common law negligence as it did to a breach of statutory duty. We did not doubt that the policy reasons for applying the defence of contributory negligence narrowly in the case of a breach of statutory duty do not apply with the same force in a case of common law negligence, but we did not find that consideration of much help in this appeal since the evidence did not show that a reasonable operator in the respondent`s position would have appreciated the risk created by the altered operation. Moreover, as stated above, we did not think that it would have been reasonable to have expected a reasonable operator in the respondent`s position to have stopped working.
Counsel for the appellants relied heavily on the case of 
 Williams v Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Co Ltd 
. Reference need only be made to the headnote to the report which reads: 
 
The plaintiff was one of a gang of six men of equal status employed by the first defendants, a stevedoring company, in unloading bags of sodium carbonate from a barge. The gang were directed by the hatch foreman who was in charge of the operation and was also an employee of the stevedoring company to follow the usual and safe method of unloading, which at first they did. When the hatch foreman left to attend to other duties, however, the gang adopted a different and dangerous method of unstowing the bags. This they continued despite further direction from the foreman on his return to level off bags to avoid danger. Subsequently the foreman gave a direct order to the plaintiff to take bags off the top tiers which the plaintiff said that he would do. He did not do it. Other warnings by the master and the mate of the barge were disregarded. Eventually a pile of the bags collapsed and injured the plaintiff. In an action by the plaintiff against the stevedoring company for damages for personal injuries caused by the negligence of the company,
 
 
 
Held: (i) each member of the gang owed a duty to the other members to take reasonable care in the work of unstowing and in the method of work employed; and for the negligence of the members of the gang other than the plaintiff in adopting an unsafe method of work the stevedoring company as their employers were vicariously liable, although the plaintiff tacitly consented to the method of working and that method was contrary to orders given to him and the other members of the gang ...
 
 
(ii) the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and, as the plaintiff`s consent had been essential to the carrying out of the work by the dangerous method, his share of the responsibility was one-half and the damages recoverable would be reduced accordingly.
  
 
 
It is quite clear that the learned judge in that case found that it was the deliberate disobedience of a direct order from a superior to the plaintiff that was the basis of the holding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. This was far removed from the facts of the present case as the evidence in this case did not show that there had been any express order conveyed to the respondent or any of the operators that the operation of the laundry press was not to be tampered with. In fact, the evidence of Baldev Singh (quoted above) showed that there had been no attempt even to draw the operators` attention to the safety features of the machines in the laundry room.
 Other matters
These considerations were sufficient to dispose of this appeal. There were, however, two other points raised by counsel for the appellants that we wish to address. First, he submitted, somewhat surprisingly in view of his concession that the appellants were to some extent liable for the injuries suffered by the respondent, that the alteration by Michael Tan was outside the scope of his employment with the consequence that the appellants could not be liable for his negligence. While the submission may have had some force in view of the warning by the laundry manager after the discovery of the comb pressed into the button of one of the machines, we were of the view that, on the facts of this case, the appellants` duty to provide and maintain a safe system of work would have made the appellants liable even if the alteration was outside of the scope of his employment. We were of the view that the learned judge was right to hold that the appellants would have been aware of the alteration had they had a proper system of supervision. The fact that there was a person who was supposed to ensure that the machines were operating safely cannot relieve the appellants as the duty to maintain a safe system of work is clearly non-delegable. Counsel in support of his argument cited the cases of 
 O`Reilly v National Rail and Tramway Appliances Lt 
 d 
, and 
 Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Co Ltd 
, which established the proposition that an employer cannot be held vicariously liable for horseplay or isolated acts of wilful misbehaviour by one of his employees. We would agree with the general proposition but it was simply not applicable here as it was shown that the appellants knew of the previous interference but yet did not take any steps, beyond warning the technicians not to do it again, to prevent a reoccurrence. The matter would have been different if the appellants had either dismissed or disciplined the technician at fault and at the same time made it plain to the operators what the safety features of the machines were and that they were not to interfere with them.
Secondly, counsel also argued strongly that the learned judge had acquitted the appellants of any breach of statutory duty. We were unable to accept that this was so. The judgment of the learned judge made no reference to breach of statutory duty even though that had been pleaded as an alternative cause of action and this was regrettable. However, it did not equate to a finding that there had been no breach of statutory duty. In fact, on the facts before us, we were of the view that the appellants were clearly in breach of their absolute duty under s 22 of the Act (it being agreed that the laundry press was a machine within s 3 of the Act) which provides:
 
 
(1) Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced; 
 
(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the dangerous part of any machinery is made safe for persons employed or working on the premises by other equally safe means.
  
 
 
While the two-handed operation of the laundry press existed, the appellants had satisfied sub-s (2) as this was as safe as fencing the machine. The removal of this safety feature clearly put the appellants in breach of their s 22 duty. That being the case, the defence of contributory negligence to this breach had even less merit. We accordingly dismissed the appeal with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In the early evening on 31 January 1987, the deceased was a pillion rider on a motor cycle ridden by the defendant along Old Jurong Road in the direction of Hong Kah Road when the motor cycle went off the road and collided into a tree. The deceased was killed.
Arising from this accident, the plaintiff, who is the father of the deceased, brought an action as administrator of the estate of the deceased for the benefit of the estate under s 7 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) (`the Act`) and for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased under s 11 of the Act.
 Liability
When the claim came on for hearing, the court was informed that the plaintiff would not proceed on the claim for the benefit of the dependants, and would only pursue the claim for the benefit of the estate. The court was also told that the parties had agreed on the figure of $7,000 as general damages for loss of expectation of life. Agreement had also been reached on special damages for funeral expenses of $2,500 and for costs of letters of administration of $2,200.
Apart from the defendant, there were no other witnesses to the accident. An investigating officer with the Traffic Police, who arrived at the scene at 9.10pm, reported that he found no brake marks or skid marks on the road surface. There were scratch marks on the grass verge, but he could not say how long they were. He made a sketch plan of what he saw, but the defendant had already been sent to hospital by the time he arrived at the scene, and he was unable to interview him until 17 days later.
In this case, there were no witnesses for the plaintiff, but the mere fact that the accident occurred spoke for itself and, in applying the maxim res ipsa loquitur, the court could draw an inference of negligence against the defendant so as to establish a prima facie case against him. The motor cycle was at all times under the defendant`s control and management, and the accident which involved the motor cycle going off the road and colliding into a tree could not have happened in the ordinary course of things without negligence on his part. A burden is therefore cast upon the defendant, and he must show how the accident actually occurred, and how this was consistent with due care on his part. In other words, he must rebut the inference of negligence raised against him: 
Ooi Han Sun & Anor v Bee Hua Meng
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 219
 
In his evidence, the defendant said that he was a technician in the Singapore Armed Forces with the rank of Staff Sergeant and the deceased was a clerk who worked under him. On that fateful day he had met the deceased at a mutual friend`s birthday party and was giving him a lift home when the accident occurred. Although a blood sample test showed that the deceased had a blood alcohol concentration of 79mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood (almost reaching the presumed incapability limit of 80mg under s 70 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276)), the defendant claimed that he could not remember having drunk anything at the party. According to him, he had been travelling along Corporation Road and had just turned right into Old Jurong Road. He was riding a powerful 1100cc motor cycle and, as there were no vehicles ahead of him, he had accelerated from a speed of 20 km/h to 50 km/h. When he had gone about 100m along Old Jurong Road, he saw a lorry travelling about another 100m ahead of him. The lorry was moving very slowly and, within another 100m or so, he had caught up to within three to four car lengths behind it, travelling close to the white centre line.
At that moment, a motor pickup suddenly came up to him on his left at a fast speed. It went past him `just by my left knee`, but did not touch him. The pickup then cut across him and squeezed into the space between him and the lorry. To avoid colliding with the pickup, he swerved to his right, and also applied both front and back brakes by pumping them. When he braked and swerved in this manner, he felt the deceased who was on his pillion pulling his T-shirt at the waist, and at the same time the deceased `pulled and pulled my left arm`, a movement which he demonstrated to the court. As a result, the motor cycle went off onto the grass verge on the right and collided into a tree. The pickup did not stop.
This then was the account of the accident by the defendant who was the only witness to it. It was also the basis of the claims in the defence which he filed, that the accident was caused or contributed to, first, by the negligence of the driver of the pickup; and, second, by the negligence of the deceased in `clutching and pulling violently at the defendant`s torso`. This was when he braked and swerved to avoid a collision with the pickup, and which, at the same time, foiled his attempt to keep control of his motor cycle and caused it to wobble, so that it moved to the right and collided into a tree.
At the hearing, the allegation of contributory negligence against the deceased was wisely not pressed by the defendant`s counsel. The fact was that the defen`s account of the deceased`s actions, coupled with his demonstration of the defendant`s pulling on his left arm, was totally unconvincing. Even if this had happened, it would have been a reflex or instinctive action on the part of the deceased which was brought about by the action of the defendant in braking and swerving and could not have amounted to contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.
The question which then remains is whether the accident was in fact caused by the negligence of the driver of the unknown pickup, as alleged by the defendant. In circumstances such as these, the answer must necessarily depend on whether the solitary evidence of the defendant is accepted. The account which he gave of how the pickup overtook him on his left was an unusual one, as he himself readily admitted in cross-examination. There was no conceivable reason for the pickup to have squeezed through on his left and into the restricted space between him and the lorry, when it had the whole of the right-hand side of the road to use. This would have been so if it was going to overtake both the motor cycle and the lorry; it would have been just as inconceivable if it was not going to do so.
The version which the defendant told about the pickup was broadly what he had reported to the police some 17 days after the accident when he was discharged from the hospital. I watched him carefully while he gave his evidence, and came to the conclusion that here was an otherwise honest person who, for some unknown reason, had decided while in hospital to concoct a story and, having done so, had to stick to the same silly story which did not do justice to himself and his counsel. The result was that in the witness box he could not remember simple facts which he should have remembered and was unnecessarily hesitant when he could. In my opinion, having heard his evidence and having watched him giving it, there was no pickup and there might even have been no lorry. For some reason which we do not know, the defendant simply lost control of his motor cycle and went off the road and collided into a tree. In my judgment, the defendant was wholly to blame for the accident.
 Damages
The deceased was born on 26 June 1962 and at the time of his death on 31 January 1987, he was 24 years old. He was a regular serviceman on contract service with the Singapore Armed Forces, holding the rank of corporal. His gross monthly salary was $793.97. Evidence was given on his employment and prospects by an SAF representative, Mdm Koh Ai Kim, which was accepted by both counsel. This showed that it would be reasonable to suppose that he would have been promoted to the rank of Sergeant in July 1987 and would have received his vocational upgrading to Clerk NCO Class 2 in March 1988. But because of his limited qualifications and experience, no further promotions would be likely. The contract which he was serving at the time of his death would have expired on 13 October 1989. He would probably have had a renewal of the contract, but each time the question of renewal came up, his chances of renewal would depend on his performance and on the need by the SAF for his skills. Also, non-combat clerical staff like the deceased who were originally classified as `Military Other Ranks` could be reclassified as `Non-uniform SAF staff` (NUSAF) with an appreciably lower pay-scale.
A lot of evidence was given by the plaintiff, the father of the deceased, about the deceased`s exemplary life, but all this appeared to me to be totally irrelevant. For a period of one year and four months before his death, he had in fact moved out of his father`s house which was his home, and stayed in the army camp, because he had differences with his wife who had remained behind in the house. He hardly ever went home after that, probably no more than once or twice in all; he had long ceased to pay anything to his mother, there was practically nothing in his savings account, and a few months before his death, his father had to pay for him the $400 premium on his life insurance policy.
At the conclusion of the hearing, I agreed with both counsel that they could make written submissions on quantum. The submissions, with detailed calculations, were later received from them, and have been the bases of the awards set out below.
 Pre-trial loss of earnings
In this case, the SAF representative`s evidence that the deceased would in all likelihood have been promoted to the rank of Sergeant in July 1987 was not seriously disputed, and she was also able to give evidence on the salaries which he would have received as a Sergeant up to the time of the trial. Based on this data, counsel for the plaintiff took the estimated gross salaries including the employers` CPF contributions and the increments and bonuses which would have been paid, less the income tax in each year, before arriving at a 40% available surplus of $30,964.13. Counsel for the defendant used the same data, but preferred in her calculation to work on median or average figures for the five years before trial. She omitted the bonuses on the ground that no evidence at all had been adduced on bonuses, and she contended that the available surplus should be 35% instead of the more conventional 40%, as the CPF rate in the SAF was considerably less. In the result, she arrived at a total award of $22,998.00 for the pre-trial loss. In my opinion, a court would be justified in including the known bonuses in calculating pre-trial loss, notwithstanding that no evidence was given on this during the hearing, just as income tax liability is deducted in the calculation even if no evidence is given of this. There should be no tax relief for the father, however, and in view of the considerably lower CPF rate applied in the SAF, the average surplus in this case should be 35% instead of 40%. All this would result in a rounded figure for pre-trial loss of $27,000.
 Loss of future earnings
As in the case of pre-trial loss, both counsel took as a base figure the deceased`s estimated salary at the time of the trial of $1,208.22, and employers` CPF contributions at 13.5%. The plaintiff`s counsel took into account an average of two months` bonus, together with tax relief for both parents of $2,000 before calculating the after-tax income. He also applied a multiplier of 15 from the date of the trial and an available surplus of 40% to arrive at a total claim of $109,653.84. The defendant`s counsel omitted the bonus element and the tax relief for parents. She also applied a multiplier of 15, but from the date of death, and arrived at a net multiplier of ten and an available surplus of 35%. In my opinion, it would be fair to allow for two months` bonus, but there should be no tax relief for parents, and the available surplus should be 35% for the reasons which I have given above. In the case of death claims, the relevant date for the assessment of the multiplier is the date of death: 
Cookson v Knowles
 
[1977] QB 913
[1979] AC 556
 In the present case, therefore, the net multiplier should be ten, which would leave a final figure for loss of future earnings of $63,500.
Damages to be awarded should therefore be as follows:
 General damages
 
 
(1) Loss of expectation of life $ 7,000 
 
(2) Loss of future earnings $63,500
  
 
 
 
 Special damages
 
 
 
(1) Funeral expenses $ 2,500 
 
(2) Costs of letters of administration $ 2,200 
 
(3) Pre-trial loss of earnings $27,000
  
 
 
There will be interest from the date of the writ to the date of judgment at the rate of 3% for pre-trial loss of earnings, and at 6% for loss of expectation of life, funeral expenses and the costs of letters of administration. There will also be costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.

The first appellant, Sim Ah Cheoh (Sim), a woman, was charged in the High Court under s 5(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) with trafficking in a substantial quantity of drugs, namely, ten packets containing not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine, on 26 April 1985 by transporting them from Hotel Negara at Claymore Drive to Changi Airport. The second and third appellants, Tan Chong Ngee Ronald (Tan) and Lim Joo Yin (Lim), were jointly charged under s 5(1) read with s 12 of the Act with abetting Sim in committing that offence. All three of them were tried jointly and were each found guilty of the charges and were convicted. Against the convictions, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution which is not in dispute is this. Sometime in February 1985, Tan enquired of one of his friends, Loo Lian Seng, whether the latter knew anyone who might be willing to engage in smuggling `precious stones`. In the following month, Loo furnished Tan with the name and telephone number of Sim and informed Tan that Sim might be interested. Sim at that time was heavily in debt due to excessive gambling and had indicated that she was so interested. As a result of the information given by Loo, Tan got in touch with Sim. Thereafter, Tan and Lim made all necessary arrangements for Sim to travel from Singapore to the United States of America: Tan assisted her in obtaining a visa to travel to the United States and Lim made a booking for her for the `West Coast Panorama` tour of the United States organized by Sino-America Travel Corporation Pte Ltd (SATCO) and paid for the cost of the tour. The tour was scheduled to depart from Singapore on 26 April 1985 at 3pm on Singapore Airlines flight SQ 2.
On 25 April 1985, Tan reserved a single room at Hotel Negara in his name. He checked into the hotel that evening and early in the following morning he left in a taxi for Pearl Bank Apartment. Sim lived in one of the flats in Pearl Bank Apartment. There was no evidence that Tan met Sim there that morning; but there was evidence that soon after his arrival at that block of apartments he took a Chinese woman in a taxi from there to Hotel Negara. There was evidence that on that morning Sim and Tan had breakfast at the Chinta Manis Coffee House in Hotel Negara. There was also evidence that soon after 10am, the same morning, a waiter, Ng Cheng Bye, served a plate of pork chop to Tan in his room. At about 12 noon, Tan checked out of the hotel. Again there was no evidence that Sim left the hotel with Tan. There was evidence, however, that Tan and a Chinese woman at the hotel took a taxi to the airport, and on arrival at the airport the Chinese woman alighted at the departure hall, while Tan remained in the taxi and returned to the city.
At the airport departure hall, at about 12 noon on 26 April 1985, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau led by Chief Narcotics Officer Teo Ho Peng (`CNO Teo`) were keeping a lookout for Sim. On the previous day, CNO Teo acting on information had been to SATCO and spoken to one Joanne Lam Yoke Chan, an employee of SATCO, who was to lead the `West Coast Panorama` tour to the United States. He enquired about Sim and was informed that Sim was one of the 12 persons joining the tour and he was given a copy of the list of passengers. He instructed Joanne Lam to identify Sim and her luggage to him at the airport on the following day. Joanne Lam, on 26 April 1985, arrived at the airport at about 12.45pm. She had with her her passengers` flight tickets and passports, including those of Sim. At the airport, Joanne Lam met CNO Teo again and also a woman assistant narcotics officer Wong See Joon (`WNO Wong`) and was reminded by CNO Teo of the arrangement. Joanne Lam was also instructed to check in Sim`s luggage but ensure that it was not placed on a conveyor belt as the luggage would be searched.
Passengers for flight SQ 2 were to check in at counter 3 in the departure hall, and accordingly Joanne Lam proceeded to counter 3 with WNO Wong. In the vicinity of that counter, she saw Sim with her luggage and she approached Sim who identified herself as Sim. Joanne Lam then nodded to CNO Teo thus indicating that the person she spoke to was Sim. Joanne Lam then took Sim`s luggage and checked in the same as instructed.
Among the narcotics officers who were at the departure hall was Senior Narcotics Officer Lim Chei Yoo (SNO Lim); he was the investigating officer with direct responsibility in the case, reporting, however, to CNO Teo. He took up his position close to counter 3 and saw CNO Teo and WNO Wong speaking to Joanne Lam. Subsequently, he saw CNO Teo signalling to him thus indicating Sim to him. Later, he saw Joanne Lam approaching Sim and handing her passport and boarding pass to her, following which Sim walked to the departure gate and passed through the immigration counter. SNO Lim and other narcotics officers trailed her. Sim proceeded to departure gate C32 and entered the screening room. In the screening room, SNO Lim approached her, identified himself and took possession of her passport. Other narcotics officers came and Sim was brought outside the screening room. There, another woman assistant narcotics officer, Lim Peck Yan, was present. SNO Lim instructed WNO Lim Peck Yan to act as an interpreter in Mandarin and told Sim that he was a narcotics officer. He asked Sim through WNO Lim Peck Yan whether she had any drugs in her possession, to which Sim replied, pointing to her chest, in Mandarin: `Yes, few packets inside.` Later, Sim told SNO Lim that she did not know what the packets contained.
CNO Teo arrived at the departure gate soon afterwards and gave instructions for Sim to be searched. She was escorted to the search room and was searched by the two woman assistant narcotics officers, Wong See Joon and Lim Peck Yan, and was found to have cloth bags strapped or otherwise attached to her person. She was wearing an abdominal binder, a panty girdle and a thigh guard on each thigh. Two long cloth bags and three smaller bags were held in place under the abdominal binder. Under the panty girdle were two long cloth bags, one against each hip. A third bag was held by the girdle against Sim`s abdomen. There was a long cloth bag under each thigh guard. Each of these bags, wrapped in masking tape, held a plastic packet containing white powder. In total there were ten packets.
Later, Sim was taken to the Central Narcotics Bu. At the Bureau, Sim told SNO Lim that when she reached the United States she was to hand the drugs she was carrying to a person who would hand her a HK$100 note, the last digit of the serial number of which would be in a sequence to that of a HK$10 note in her possession. She handed the HK$10 note to SNO Lim.
Later in the afternoon, arrangements were made for a statement to be recorded from her under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The recording officer was Senior Narcotics Officer S Vijakumar and the interpreter was Wu Nan Yong. The woman assistant narcotics officer, Wong See Joon, was also present. A statement was recorded from her, to which we shall revert in a moment.
Meanwhile, instructions had been given to narcoofficers to arrest Tan and Lim. They were arrested the same evening and brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau. When they were brought to SNO Lim`s office at about 8.45pm, Sim was there, and on seeing Tan and Lim, she identified them to SNO Lim as being the persons who had assisted her. Sim was then escorted out to another room. Tan and Lim were searched and among the items found in Lim`s person were (i) a slip of paper bearing the full name and identity card number of Sim and (ii) another slip of paper with Sim`s full name on it, some figures and the legend `S & USA` and two copies of a document containing flight details and an itinerary issued by SATCO. It was subsequently ascertained that the slip of paper described in (i) was written by Tan to Lim.
On the following day, arrangements were made for statements to be recorded from Tan and Lim under s 122(6) of the CPC. The recording officer was also SNO Vijakumar and the interpreter was Wu Nan Yong. Statements were recorded from both of them respectively to which we shall refer in a moment.
The contents of the ten packets found on Sim`s person were analysed and were found to contain not less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine.
At the trial, the admissibility of the statements made by the appellants respectively was objected to by their respective counsel on the ground that they were in each case not made voluntarily. A trial within a trial was held, and the trial judges at the conclusion found that each of the statements was made voluntarily. They were therefore admitted in evidence. The material part of the statement of Sim was as follows: 
 
I was made use by a male Chinese whose name I don`t know. About a month ago he told me to smuggle diamonds and I agreed. About two weeks ago he told me to smuggle `peh hoon` and the amount will only be one packet. I agreed as I thought the quantity is small. He also told me that even if I were to be arrested in US I would be jailed for a few years only. This morning at about 5am he fetched me from my home to a hotel in Orchard Road. Inside the hotel room another male Chinese took out and showed me ten packets of `peh hoon` which were already packed. The first male Chinese asked me to strap them to my body. I told him I could not carry the ten packets of `peh hoon` because it would be difficult to strap all to my body. He then told me that he has already promised someone in US to deliver ten packets of `peh hoon`. Then I strapped the ten packets to my body. After strapping he gave me a piece of Hong Kong dollar note stating that the person who`s to take delivery of the ten packets of `peh hoon` will produce another Hong Kong dollar note, the last digit of the serial number being consecutive to that of mine.
 
 
 
The statement of Tan was as follows: 
 
On 26 April 1985 at 6.45am, `Ah Hai` rang me up and told me to call `Sum Ku Leong`. I then rang her and told her to come down to the ground floor of her Pearl Bank apartment. She came down and I brought her to Negara Hotel Room No 202. Here I received Ah Hai`s telephone call and told him `Sum Ku Leong` was with me. After a short while Ah Hai came into the room holding a black plastic bag in his hand. Ah Hai then took out some packets from the bag and I helped him to strap the packets onto Sum Ku Leong`s body. After the strapping `Sum Ku Leong` put on her suit and blouse and walked around to see whether the packets would drop or not. Then `Ah Hai` told her to remove the strapping and re-strap the packets so that she would be able to remove it herself. `Sum Ku Leong` did as told and when `Ah Hai` was satisfied he left the room. Sum Ku Leong and myself then boarded a taxi to go to Changi Airport. At the airport she alighted while I left in the same taxi for home.
 
 
 
After the statement was taken, the recording officer, SNO Vijakumar, asked Tan certain questions which Tan answered, and the questions and answers were as follows:
 
 
Q1: In line 1 you mentioned `Ah Hai`. Who is Ah Hai? 
 
A: Ah Hai was the male Chinese who was arrested with me on 26 April 1985. I do not know his real name. 
 
Q2: In line 2 you mentioned `Sum Ku Leong`. Who is Sum Ku Leong? 
 
A: She was the woman arrested before I was arrested. I also do not know her real name. 
 
Q3: In line 9 you said Ah Hai took out some packets from the plastic bag. What do you think was inside the packets? 
 
A: I do not know but from the softness of the packets, I guessed it was `peh hoon`.
  
 
 
The statement recorded from Lim was as follows: 
 
A male Chinese known to me only as `Lau Tah` asked me once to get a person to deliver something. I then went to look for Ronald about getting someone for delivering something. Later Ronald told me he had found a female Chinese who is willing to deliver. When `Lau Tah` rang me I told him I have a person who is willing to deliver. `Lau Tah` then gave me money to buy clothing and air ticket to USA for the female Chinese whom Ronald and I called `Ah Che`. At about 8am on 26 April 1985 `Lau Tah` handed me a plastic bag outside Negara Hotel and he left. I took this bag and went to a room in Hotel Negara where Ronald and `Ah Che` were waiting for me. I then took out the packets from the plastic bag which `Lau Tah` had given me earlier on and asked `Ah Che` to strap them to her body. When I took the packets out I felt something soft inside them. All the packets were prepared and ready for strapping. Ronald and I helped `Ah Che` to strap the packets. After this I left them.
 
 
 
The recording officer also asked Lim certain questions which Lim answered, and they were as follows:
 
 
Q1: Who is `Lau Tah` as mentioned by you in line 2. 
 
A: `Lau Tah` is in his 40`s but I don`t know his real name. I think he`s a Singaporean. 
 
Q2: How long do you know `Lau Tah`? 
 
A: I know `Lau Tah` for about four months. 
 
Q3: How did you come to know `Lau Tah`? 
 
A: A Malaysian friend of mine `Ah Tee` introduced me to `Lau Tah` at a coffee-shop. 
 
Q4: In lines 2 and 3 you said `Lau Tah` asked you to get someone to deliver something. What`s the `something`? 
 
A: At first I did not bother about the `something`. Later on I guessed it would be something illegal. 
 
Q5: Who is Ronald as mentioned in line 3 by you? 
 
A: Ronald is my friend who was arrested on the same day as myself, that is on 26 April 1985. 
 
Q6: You said in lines 17 and 18 that when you took the packets out from the plastic bag, you felt something soft inside them. Did you know what was inside? 
 
A: I guessed it was `peh hoon`.
  
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the appellants respectively submitted that no case had been made out against the appellants, which, if unrebutted, would warrant their convictions on the charges against them. These arguments were rejected by the trial judges who held that a case had been made out and called upon the appellants to enter upon their defence. Each of the appellants elected not to give evidence or to call any evidence in their defence. The trial judges held that in the circumstances they `had no alternative but to convict all three accused as charged`.
Before us, counsel for the appellants mounted three main arguments in support of the appeal. First, it was argued by counsel for Sim, who advanced this argument on behalf of all the appellants, that the prosecution had failed to prove an essential ingredient of the charge against Sim, namely, that Sim transported the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport (as described in the charge); that there was no evidence at all of such transportation, save for the statements recorded from the appellants, and that the finding of the trial judges that the ingredient of transportation had been established was based on an inference they drew and on the statements. It was not safe, so counsel submitted, to draw such inference of transportation, because there were competing rational inferences, and as for the statements they could not be relied upon as a foundation of the conviction of Sim. There was therefore a fatal gap or break in the evidence against Sim, and the charge against her had not been proved. In consequence, the charge against Tan and Lim for abetting Sim in trafficking in drugs could not stand.
There are two limbs in this argument. The first was directed to the proper inference that could be drawn from the evidence adduced as there was no direct evidence that Sim transported the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport. The direct relevant evidence which was not challenged or disputed established the following: that Tan had recruited Sim to smuggle `precious stones`; that both Tan and Lim made all the necessary travelling arrangements for Sim to travel from Singapore to the United States; that early in the morning of 26 April 1985, Tan, who had on the previous night checked into Hotel Negara, went to Pearl Bank Apartment where Sim stayed, and from there he brought a Chinese woman to Hotel Negara; that in that morning a waitress at the coffee house in Hotel Negara served breakfast to Tan and Sim; that at about 10am a waiter served a plate of pork chop to Tan in his room; that at about 12 noon Tan checked out of the hotel and took a Chinese woman in a taxi to the airport where the woman alighted; that at the departure hall of Changi Airport Sim was identified by Joanne Lam to CNO Teo who then identified her to SNO Lim; that thenceforth Sim was under surveillance and was trailed to the departure gate C32 and the screening room where she was arrested, and that upon arrest she was found to have strapped to her person the ten packets, each containing white powder, which upon analysis were found to contain no less than 1,370.3g of diamorphine. From these primary facts the only proper inference that one can draw is that Sim was the woman who was brought from Pearl Bank Apartment to Hotel Negara, that she was also the woman who travelled with Tan in a taxi from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport and that she had with her during this journey the ten packets of white substance which were subsequently found strapped to her person. Counsel did not show us what other competing inference could sensibly and reasonably be drawn from these facts; when asked, his riposte was that it was for the prosecution to fill this gap in the evidence. In our opinion, these primary facts do not admit of any other inference; any other inference would, in the words of the trial judges, be wholly fanciful.
The second limb of the argument was directed to the three statements made by the appellants respectively under s 122(6) of the CPC. It was argued that the only evidence which proved the essential ingredient of the charge against Sim, ie the transportation of the drugs from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport, consisted of the three statements and that each of these statements was a confession made by a co-accused which affected himself or herself (as the case may be) and the other accused and could not be relied on solely as a basis or foundation for sustaining the conviction of Sim and consequently the convictions of Tan and Lim. Where the other evidence adduced was insufficient to establish the charge or was wholly unsatisfactory there was no scope for a conviction of an accused on the sole basis of the confession of a co-accused. The basis of counsel`s submission is s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which provides as follows: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court 
 may take into consideration
 such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
This section is in pari materia with s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, and it has been decided in a series of Indian cases that under that section a confession of an accused implicating himself and his co-accused may be taken into consideration along with other evidence and a conviction based only on such confession cannot stand. These cases have thus given a narrow construction to the words `may take into consideration` in that section. Counsel referred us to numerous cases, among which were: 
 Bhuboni Sahu 
 
 v 
 
 The King 
 1949 AIR 36 PC 257 and 
 Kashmira Singh 
 
 v 
 
 State of Madhya Pradesh 
 [1952] SC 526. In 
 Bhuboni Sahu, 
 which was an appeal to the Privy Council, the evidence consisted of mainly the confession of a co-accused which implicated the co-accused and the appellant and the Privy Council held, among other things, that this confession was not sufficient to sustain the conviction of the appellant of murder and the conviction was set aside. Sir John Beaumont in delivering the judgment of the Board said, at p 260: 
 
Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of `evidence` contained in s 8, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. Clearly there must be other evidence. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. The Lordships think that the view which has prevailed in most of the High Courts in India, namely, that the confession of a co-accused can be used only in support of other evidence and cannot be made the foundation of a conviction, is correct.
 
 
 
In 
 Kashmira Singh, 
 the Supreme Court of India held that the evidence for the conviction of the accused of murder, which was based substantially on the evidence of a confession of a co-accused implicating himself and the accused, was insufficient and set aside the conviction of murder. Vivian Bose J said, at pp 529-530: 
 
In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in 
 Emperor
 
 v
 
 Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty
 [1911] ILR 38 Cal 559 at 588 where he said that such a confession can only be used to `lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused` or, to put it in another way, as Reilly J did in 
 Re Periyaswami Moopan
 [1931] ILR 54 Mad 75 at 77:
 
 
 
`the provision goes no further than this - where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in s 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence.`
 
 
 
Translating these observations into concrete terms they come to this. The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, 
 if it is believed,
 a conviction could safely be based on it. If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid. But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, 
 if believed,
 it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction. In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.
 
 
 
Similarly, the courts in Malaysia have also adopted the same construction of the words `may take into consideration` in the corresponding provision, namely, s 30 of the Malaysian Evidence Act 1950. In 
 Yusoff & Anor 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 47
  at pp 48-49 Mathew CJ said: 
 
... even accepting the confession of the second appellant as being both voluntary and true, there is the question whether the confession was sufficient to establish the guilt of the first appellant. Section 30 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:
 
 
 
`When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court 
 may take into consideration
 such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.` (The emphasis is ours.)
 
 
 
The effect of the words `may take into consideration` is well set out in 
 Woodroffe and Ameer Ali`s Law of Evidence
 (9th Ed) at pp 312 and 313, as follows:
 
 
 
`These words do not mean that the confession is to have the force of sworn evidence, but such a confession is nevertheless evidence in the sense that it is matter which the court, before whom it is made, may take into consideration in order to determine whether the issue of guilt is proved or not. The wording, however, of this section (which is an exception) shows that such a confession is merely to be an element in the consideration of all the facts of the case; while allowing it to be so considered, it does not do away with the necessity of other evidence.`
 
 
 
The other evidence is of little, if of any, value and merely shows that the two appellants were seen together about midnight on 19/20 September 1955. In fact, the convictions rest entirely on the confession of the second appellant which we have already pointed out is wrong.
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by the Federal Court of Malaysia in 
 PP 
 
 v 
 
 Nordin bin Johan & Anor 
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  at p 222.
These cases are undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 of the Evidence Act and we respectfully agree with the views expressed in these decisions. However, on the evidence before us, this argument on behalf of the appellants must fail. We revert again, very briefly, to the statements made by the appellants respectively. Sim`s statement was evidence against herself as to possession of the heroin and of the preparatory steps taken to carry them to the United States. Tan`s statement was evidence against (i) Sim as to possession and transportation of the heroin by Sim from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport and (ii) himself as to abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person and in transporting them. Lim`s statement was evidence against himself as to possession of the heroin and abetting Sim in strapping the heroin to her person with a view to transporting them. These statements were not the only evidence against Sim as to transportation of the heroin. There was a preponderance of other evidence against Sim on that point. As we have demonstrated, there were primary facts which had been established by direct evidence and which, in our view, led inescapably to the inference that she carried the heroin from Hotel Negara to Changi Airport. Accordingly, in our judgment, these statements were not the foundation of the conviction of Sim of the offence with which she was charged. They `lent assurance to the other evidence`. In so far as the convictions of Tan and Lim are concerned their statements as against them respectively were evidence of the parts they played respectively in assisting Sim in the transportation of the heroin and can be relied upon. Again, there was also other evidence that they assisted Sim. We accordingly rejected the first argument submitted on behalf of the appellants.
The second argument mounted by counsel for Sim, who again advanced this argument on behalf of all the appellants, was that there was a miscarriage of justice in that the trial judges failed to consider whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. After the appellants were called upon by the trial judges to enter upon their defence, they elected not to give evidence or to call any evidence in their defence. The trial judges in their grounds of decision said: 
 
Accordingly, we found that a case against all three accused had been made out which, if unrebutted, would warrant their conviction. They were called upon to make their defence, and were given the standard allocution. Counsel then asked for an adjournment, which was granted. Upon resumption of the trial counsel for Sim, speaking for himself and for counsel representing Tan and Lim, informed us that each accused had decided not to give evidence, and not to call other evidence, all the accused standing on the submissions of their respective counsel that the prosecution had failed to prove transportation beyond reasonable doubt.
 
 
 
In the result, we had no alternative but to convict all those accused as charged. We did so, and sentenced them to death.
The criticism made by counsel on the last paragraph of the grounds of decision was that the trial judges at that juncture did not proceed to examine and assess the evidence adduced and consider whether the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt; the test which the trial judges applied in deciding to call upon the appellants to enter on their defence is not the same as that in deliberating on the guilt of the appellants at the end of the trial. In support, counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  at p 52: 
 
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s case what has to be decided remains a question of law only. As decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
 
 
 
Technically and in so far as the last paragraph of the grounds of decision of the trial judges is concerned, the point made by counsel is valid. In a criminal trial there are two critical stages at which the court has to make a decision. Under s 189(1) of the CPC, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the court has to decide whether the prosecution has made out a case, which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the accused. In deciding this question or issue, the court ought not to consider whether the possession has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 said, at p 51: 
 
The crucial words in s [189(1)] are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s [189(1)] the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.
 
 
 
At that stage, what the court has to decide is whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If the court so decides that each essential element in the alleged offence has been established he must call for the defence. At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence. After the defence has been called and evidence, if any, of the accused and other witnesses has been tendered and counsel for both sides have made their respective closing submissions, the court must, at that stage, proceed to examine the evidence adduced, assess the veraand accuracy thereof and consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
In the instant case, the trial judges did not spell out in the last paragraph of their grounds of decision that at the second or final stage of the trial they had considered all the evidence and found that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, at the trial in making their findings on the guilt of the appellants they said: 
 
Please tell the first accused that we find her guilty as charged and we accordingly convict her of the offence with which she has been charged. Similarly, please tell the second accused Ronald Tan Cheng Ngee that we are again satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged and we convict him accordingly. And thirdly, please tell the accused Lim Joo Yin that we are also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged and we convict him accordingly.
 
 
 
Therefore, having regard to these findings and the evidence before them, the trial judges must have found that on the evidence the prosecution had proved its case against the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt, though they did not explicitly say so in the concluding part of their grounds of decision. That they had reached the conclusion that a case beyond any reasonable doubt had been established by the prosecution was also evident from the following passage of their grounds of decision: 
 
In our judgment, the objective facts established by the evidence allowed of only one sensible inference. The statements of all three accused established that the packets containing the drugs were strapped to Sim`s person in a room at Hotel Negara. Tan and Lim assisted in the strapping operation. Tan`s statement made it clear that after the packets had been strapped on for the first time, Sim dressed and walked about the room to ensure that the packets were secure. Lim then instructed her to remove the packets, and restrap them onto herself so that she would be able to unstrap them on her own. Sim did as she was told, and only when Lim was satisfied did he leave the room. Tan`s statement went on to say that he and Sim `then boarded a taxi to go to Changi Airport`. At the airport, Sim disembarked and Tan proceeded back to his house in the same taxi.
 
 
 
To suggest, in the face of that evidence, that the packets having been strapped onto Sim for the second time to Lim`s satisfaction in Hotel Negara, they were then removed, were not transported by Sim in the taxi, but re-materialized at the airport for her to have strapped them on there, was in our view wholly fanciful.
Having reached that conclusion and in view of the fact that the defence had not tendered any evidence by the appellants or any other witness the trial judges probably considered that it would be tautologous to repeat the same exercise. It seems to us that for that reason they said they had no alternative but to convict the appellants.
Assuming that there was an error made by the trial judges, as contended on behalf of the appellants, in our judgment, no miscarriage of justice at all has occurred in this case. The evidence against Sim was overwhelming, and so also was the evidence against Tan and Lim. Apart from the admissibility of the three statements of the appellants, there was substantially no dispute on the evidence adduced by the prosecution in any material respect. As for those statements, their admissibility was challenged but the trial judges, after the trial within a trial, were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were made voluntarily, and, accordingly, they were admitted in evidence. In our judgment, on such evidence, the trial judges could not have reached any other conclusion than that the guilt of the appellants had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Plainly, this is a case where the proviso to s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) is applicable.
Finally, counsel for the appellants sought to impeach the findings of the trial judges that the statements recorded from the appellants respectively under s 122(6) of the CPC were given by them voluntarily. These are purely findings of fact. The trial judges had considered the evidence given by the appellants and also the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses. They rejected the evidence of the appellants and accepted the evidence of SNO Lim, SNO Vijakumar and Wu Nan Yong, and found that the statements were made by the appellants voluntarily. The trial judges, on the evidence before them, were justified in coming to such findings. There is, however, one argument advanced by counsel for Tan and Lim which merits consideration.
In recording the statements from Tan and Lim respectively, SNO Vijakumar asked them several questions on the statements and the answers were given by them respectively. It was argued by counsel that SNO Vijakumar cross-examined them on the statements recorded, and such cross-examinations were improper and rendered the statements inadmissible. The trial judges considered the evidence and the explanation given by SNO Vijakumar for asking the questions, and held that the questions were not put to them by way of cross-examination. We are unable to agree with the views of the trial judges on this point. In our opinion, the questions asked were more than those truly required for clarification. They were asked with a view to eliciting answers from the maker of the statement which would be evidence favourable to the party questioning. SNO Vijakumar need not have asked, and ought not to have asked, those questions. The purpose of s 122(6) of the CPC is to inform the accused of the charge he is facing and to give him an opportunity of stating any fact on which he intends to rely in his defence in court and further to warn him that if he does not state it then, his silence may give rise to an adverse inference against him. The role of a recording officer is spelt out in s 122(6): to prefer and read out the charge to the accused or to inform him officially of the charge, to serve on him a notice in writing in terms as prescribed in that subsection, to explain the notice to him, and thereafter if the accused wishes to say anything, to record accurately what he says. It is no part of the duty of such recording officer to ask the accused any question in relation to what he said. In our opinion, any cross-examination conducted by a recording officer on the statement taken from the accused under s 122(6) is improper, and we disapprove it. Any other form of questioning, unless it is absolutely necessary, is wholly inadvisable and is to be discouraged.
The next question is whether by reason of such cross-examination the statements made by Tan and Lim are admissible. The trial judges appeared to take the view that where an accused person makes a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC, questions asked by the recording officer by way of cross-examination are improper and render the resultant statement inadmissible and accepted the case of 
 Cheng Seng Heng & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 175
  as the authority. That was a case decided by the Court of Appeal of the Federation of Malaya on the basis of reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations 1948, and Spenser-Wilkinson J in delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to some English and local authorities, said, at p 178: 
 
On the principles enunciated in the above-quoted authorities we hold that under reg 33 of the Emergency Regulations the police have no right to elicit statements from accused persons by means of cross-examination or anything in the nature of cross-examination. The only safe rule to be followed when statements are being taken from accused persons by the police under reg 33 is r 7 of the Judges` Rules set out above and any departure from this rule will render the statements inadmissible in evidence.
 
 
 
The Judges` Rules referred to in the judgment are the Judges` Rules then in force in England, and r 7 thereof was identical with r 8 of Sch E to proviso (b) of sub-s (5) of s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code then in force. But sub-s (5) (which was the precursor of the existing sub-s (6) of s 122) and Sch E were introduced to the Criminal Procedure Code by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1960. Section 121 (now s 122) by sub-s (5) thereof for the first time allowed a statement made at any time by a person who is charged with an offence in the hearing of a police officer of or above the rank of inspector to be admissible in evidence at his trial, but such admission was expressly made subject to two provisos, namely: (i) proviso (a) which was in pari materia with the proviso to the existing s 122(5), and (ii) proviso (b) which is as follows: 
 
in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the rules set out in Schedule E to this Code.
 
 
 
And r 8 of the Rules as set out in Sch E to the Code provided: 
 
A prisoner making a voluntary statement must not be cross-examined, and no questions shall be put to him about it except for the purpose of removing ambiguity in what he has actually said. For instance, if he has mentioned an hour without saying whether it was morning or evening, or has given a day of the week and day of the month which do not agree, or has not made it clear to what individual or what place is intended to refer in some part of his statement, he may be questioned sufficiently to clear up the point.
 
 
 
By the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1976 (which came into force on 1 January 1977), among other things, the proviso (b) to the then s 121(5) and Sch E were repealed, and the present sub-s (6) of s 122 was introduced. Hence, with the repeal of those provisions, there is nothing in s 122 to say that a statement recorded from an accused under s 122(6) is inadmissible in evidence if in the course of or after recording the statement the accused is cross-examined thereon by the recording officer. In our opinion, cross-examination per se does not render the statement inadmissible, if it is otherwise admissible. The admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is not governed by that subsection but, in the case where a statement is made to a police officer, is governed by s 122(5) of the CPC: see 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
 , and in the case of a statement made to a narcotics officer, as in this case, by the Evidence Act: see 
 PP 
 
 v 
 
 Tan Boon Tat 
 
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
 
 . 
 In 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
, Wee Chong Jin CJ, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said, at p 266: 
 
Section 122(6) itself does not provide for the admissibility of statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation.
 
 
 
That s 122(5) governs the admissibility of statements made under s 122(6) is confirmed by s 122(7), which reads: 
 
`No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice served on him pursuant to sub-s (6) shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to sub-s (5), if it is otherwise voluntary.`
 
 
 
In our judgment, a statement whether or not it is purported to have been made under s 122(6) is admissible in evidence so long as s 122(5) is satisfied. There is no doubt that an inculpatory statement so admitted is evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
 
 
However, cross-examination could in certain circumstances render the statement or the answers to the questions inadmissible, eg if the questioning is so vigorous or prolonged that it becomes oppressive with the result that a doubt arises as to whether the statement or the answers have been caused by any fear or threat. Such, however, was not the case.
In the result, all the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants failed and the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

On 2 December 1991 at about 10.45am, the vessel Hudson Bay was anchored at the Eastern Special Purposes Anchorage and receiving fuel oil from a bunker barge into its tank No 15. The fast pumping rate caused a sudden overflow of oil from the air vent of the tank onto the deck, and over the side of the Hudson Bay into the sea. The resulting oil slick measured about 300m by 5m in broken patches, covering an area of some 1,500m2. Cleaning operations were carried out by the anti-pollution sea unit of the Port of Singapore Authority. The costs of these operations amounted to $12,859 and were paid in full by the appellants, the agents of Hudson Bay.
The appellants were charged in the subordinate courts with an offence under s 7 of the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act (Cap 243) (`the Act`). So far as is material, s 7(1) provides: 
 
... if any discharge of oil or an oily mixture occurs from a Singapore ship into any part of the sea or from any ship into Singapore waters, the master, the owner and the agent of the ship shall each be guilty of an offence and shall each be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both.
 
 
 
The appellants pleaded guilty to the offence. In mitigation it was said that pollution had been caused accidentally, and that as soon as the spill had been discovered the pumping had been stopped and detergent immediately sprayed. The appellants had no antecedents.
The learned district judge imposed a fine of $10,000, which the appellants appealed against as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal.
Before me, the thrust of the submissions of counsel for the appellants was that a fine of $10,000 was manifestly excessive, being significantly higher than the usual range of fines for this offence. He pointed out that in PSA Summons No 737 of 1989 which involved a slick covering some 300m2 and cleaning-up costs of $11,456, the accused was only fined $4,000 despite seven similar previous convictions. The learned DPP also provided statistics on the various fines imposed in 1990 and 1991 for convictions for this offence, which ranged from the bare minimum of $500 to $5,000. The highest fine for this offence which counsel were acquainted with was a fine of $10,000 imposed by the district court in another case, which was subsequently reduced to $7,500 on appeal to the High Court.
Counsel for the appellants contended that this case could not be distinguished from the others, either on the ground of moral culpability or on the ground that the consequences of the spillage were more serious, such as would justify the imposition of a fine significantly higher than those within the usual range. Further, the appellants had pleaded guilty, and according to the usual principles of sentencing, as enunciated for example by Cumming-Bruce LJ in 
 R v Boyd 
 ,1 this should have proved a mitigating factor as regards the severity of the fine imposed.
The learned DPP, however, contended that notwithstanding the statistics a fine of $10,000 could not be excessive, having regard to the obvious legislative intention of keeping the sea free of oil pollution. I agreed with him and dismissed the appeal.
The range of fines permitted by the Act is very wide, ranging from $500 to $500,000, and it would in my opinion be useful to make some comments on the sentencing guidelines to be applied in such cases.
It was common ground between the parties that the offence under s 7 was one of strict liability, in their case merely requiring proof of a discharge of oil from a ship into Singapore waters. It was not necessary to prove fault on the part of the master, owner or agent of the ship to render any of them liable. In the present case, the appellants contended that the spillage had been caused through no fault of theirs or of the master or crew of the Hudson Bay. They said that the unlawful discharge had occurred because the bunker barge supplying the fuel oil had done so at a faster rate than that requested by the Hudson Bay crew, which the ship`s tanks were unable to handle.
The presence or absence of fault on the part of the defendant is generally a relevant consideration when it comes to sentencing. Similarly, that a defendant is a first-time offender and that he has pleaded guilty to the offence would normally also constitute mitigating factors in this context. However, the principles which apply to sentencing for an offence of strict liability are different. The usual objectives of sentencing and the penal system as a whole, of individual deterrence, general deterrence and reformation, as enunciated by Keith Devlin in his book 
 On Sentencing Offenders In Magistrates` Courts 
 (1970 Ed), can have little bearing in the case of an offence which may be committed without fault on the part of the offender, or even against his active wishes. The nature of strict liability offences is such that they may be committed even when all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that they are not committed. Therefore, no fine which could be imposed would necessarily prove a deterrent to the commission of such an offence.
Thus the only objective for the most part that there could reasonably be behind sentencing for a strict liability offence is that the sentence be, in the words of Keith Devlin, retributive: that the sentence imposed should be measured by the disapproval of society regarding the nature of the offence committed. A high sentence, therefore, would reflect the gravity of the offence. The maximum penalties should be reserved for the most serious cases in terms of consequences as well as conduct. The presence of fault and of previous convictions can only be relevant in this context.
It is beyond question that environmental concerns have become an important issue on both the national and global platforms. Only now are we beginning to realize the true extent of the long-term damage that may be caused to our immediate environment by oil pollution, to our sea resources and marine life. Also, as was pointed out by the learned DPP, Singapore has enacted the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil in the Act, and is a signatory to the 1982 Convention for the Law of the Sea. Further, Singaporean Ambassador Professor Tommy Koh chaired the recent UN Conference on Environment and Development. It is evident from this that Singapore has undertaken obligations under international law to ensure that her seas and environment be kept clean and free of pollution. In the light of growing awareness of the damaging effects of oil pollution on a national as well as a global scale, and in order to combat this, it is imperative that the courts regard offences of pollution with the utmost gravity. Parliament has evinced its concern for the seriousness of these offences by making them ones of strict liability. As far as sentencing for these offences go, I am of the view that the fines previously imposed for offences under s 7(1) taken in today`s context do not accurately reflect the strong public interest in preventing oil pollution as discussed above. I am certain that similar considerations were in the mind of the district judge in this case at the hearing below, when he imposed the fine that was outside the range previously imposed.
In this case, the appellants were carrying out an activity which was potentially hazardous: they must have been aware of the pollution that would result had something gone wrong in the process. That they would be liable to a high fine even if the pollution had not been caused through their culpability, in the words of Lord Salmon in 
 Alphacell Ltd v Woodward 
 2 at p 848, `may be regarded as a not unfair hazard of carrying on a business which may cause pollution on the banks of a river`. The consequences of their commission of the offence, a slick of some 1,500m2, cannot be said to be trivial. Accordingly, I felt that the $10,000 fine imposed by the learned district judge was not manifestly excessive but perfectly reasonable.
Keith Devlin writes that in sentencing for strict liability offences, except where the offence is either trivial or extremely serious, one ends up with a fairly standardized fine, and that the task of the court is to draw a distinction between the `normal` offence where normal penalties should assist, and the relatively unusual case where special considerations ought to apply. I have already stated that in the case of an offender with a series of previous convictions, or one who has committed the offence with complete disregard for any safeguard measures or even intentionally, or one who has managed to create a devastatingly large oil slick resulting in the death of countless marine life, a more severe penalty should be imposed: the maximum penalty provided for in the Act is a fine of $500,000. On the other hand in the case, such as the one before me, of a breach where there have been no such aggravating factors, I am of the view that it would be instructive to standardize the penalty at a fine in the region of $10,000.

This was an appeal against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner Mr Amarjeet Singh convicting the appellant on a charge of trafficking in not less than 24.97g of diamorphine under s 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
On the morning of 19 June 1991, a team of narcotics officers mounted a surveillance operation in the vicinity of a bus-stop along Woodlands Road. The officers took up their respective positions around the area at about 8.45am. Narcotics Officer Juahir bin Ismail (`NO Juahir`) was stationed at the second storey of a deserted shophouse about 20m behind the bus-stop and had a clear view of the bus-stop. Woodlands Road was divided by a fenced barrier with two lanes on either side. Diagonally across from the bus-stop, on the other side of Woodlands Road in the direction of the city, was a community centre. Corporal Wong Chong Yeo (`Cpl Wong`) and two other officers were stationed at different points in the community centre. Cpl Wong had a clear view of the bus-stop some 30-40m away across Woodlands Road. Narcotics Officer Ho Thiam Huat (`NO Ho`) was cruising in his car along this two-way stretch of road. Traffic was light; there were few pedestrians on the road.
At about 10.30am, NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho all saw the appellant walking along the pavement towards the bus-stop in the same direction as the traffic, carrying a white plastic carrier bag which had some sort of markings by its cut-out handles. NO Ho was at the time driving along the extreme left bus lane at about 50kph, and was some 50m away from the bus-stop; he spotted the appellant when the latter was some 5m away from the bus-stop. NO Juahir and Cpl Wong saw the appellant when he was some 10-15m away from the bus-stop. All three of them saw him putting the plastic bag on a seat of the bus-stop, and then going to sit on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop.
When the three officers spotted the appellant at the bus-stop, they alerted their leader, Inspector P Senthilnathan, who then ordered the team to move in to effect arrest. The officers arrested and handcuffed the appellant. From that moment onwards, the appellant did not touch the white plastic bag. When questioned, the appellant denied that the bag was his and any knowledge of its contents. The appellant was brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) at around mid-day. Inspector Alan Moh (`Insp Moh`) took charge of the case as the investigating officer.
The white plastic bag seized from the bus-stop was found to contain a bundle wrapped in a page of the `
 China Press 
` newspaper (dated 18 June 1991). Inside the wrapping was a translucent packet containing some 452g of a granular substance. This was analyzed and found to contain not less than 24.97g of diamorphine. The white plastic bag was dusted for fingerprints. Three latent prints were lifted. The expert evidence showed that one of these prints had been made by the impression of the appellant`s left thumb.
On the afternoon of 19 June 1991, a statement was taken from the appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 122(6) statement`). The appellant was subjected to medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement; the reports of the examinations were negative. The s 122(6) statement was not sought to be admitted in evidence at trial. Instead, the prosecution sought to admit a long statement under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 121 statement`), which, on the face of it, was taken from the appellant by Insp Moh two days later, on 21 June 1991, between 12.15pm and 3.40pm. The appellant was not medically examined before and after he had made this statement.
The appellant disputed the admissibility of the s 121 statement and a voir dire was held. It is necessary to deal with the voir dire in some detail as the main arguments before us were centred essentially on the admission of this statement in evidence by the trial judge at the conclusion of the voir dire.
Insp Moh gave evidence that on 21 June 1991, at 11.50am, he took the appellant from the lock-up to his office and began the recording of the s 121 statement. This was done by him alone without the service of an interpreter. Insp Moh stated that he had offered an interpreter to the appellant, but the appellant refused, and that as both of them were conversant in Cantonese, the recording of the statement proceeded in that dialect, with Insp Moh translating it into English for the purposes of the recording. After five pages of the statement had been recorded and read back to the appellant in Cantonese, the appellant signed on every page, and both of them had lunch. Afterwards, the appellant asked to make a further statement extending over three pages, and, after this second recording the appellant was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Insp Krishnan, NO Porter and NO Lim admitted to having taken the appellant from the lock-up in the evening of 19 June 1991 for an interrogation session. They said, however, that the purpose of interrogating the appellant was to gather intelligence about other drug traffickers which the appellant might have knowledge of, and not to extract a confession from the appellant. They denied that they had assaulted the appellant to make him confess and had fabricated the s 121 statement.
The evidence of the appellant at the voir dire was this. On 19 June 1991, NO Porter had taken him from the lock-up at about 6.35pm before he could have dinner. He had not eaten since breakfast on the morning he was arrested. He was taken to an office with his hands handcuffed behind his back, and interrogated by the three officers in Hokkien and was urged to confess. When he denied that the drugs were his, NO Porter and NO Lim assaulted him continuously for 15-25 minutes, punching him in the stomach and kicking his legs. He was severely assaulted and the pain was unbearable. He was very hungry and asked for food, saying that if they gave him food he would do whatever they wanted. One of them went to fetch food and it was given to him an hour later.
NO Porter then typed the statement in the appellant`s presence, making reference to a small piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5"". Although NO Porter kept asking him questions while typing the statement, he merely replied that he would sign whatever NO Porter typed. NO Porter then read the statement out to him in Hokkien, and he signed on every page. In cross-examination, he stated that the s 121 statement before the court was the same document as the statement he had signed, except that, when he signed it, some space on the first page of the statement had been left blank.
The appellant further testified that, as a result of the assault on him, he sustained a huge bruise of some 10-12cm in diameter on the right side of his rib cage. He said that it caused him intense pain that came and went. He did not report this to the officers-in-charge on his return to the lock-up because he was in pain. He reported it to an officer the next day but nothing was done. He informed a cell-mate, Ong Kee Kwok (`Ong`), of the assault and showed him his bruise. The appellant also said that on his remand at Queenstown Remand Prison two weeks later, he still felt the pain, and asked to see a doctor there, but, again, nothing was done.
The appellant explained that at 11.50am on 21 June 1991, Insp Moh took him out from the lock-up to his office not to take the statement as alleged by the prosecution, but to have the statement, which had already been typed by NO Porter, read over to him. There was no interpreter present, and both of them spoke in Cantonese, which Insp Moh had elected to use. He told Insp Moh that there was no need to read the statement to him as he knew what it said. Thereafter, Insp Moh gave him tea and cakes and they chatted about inconsequential matters until he was returned to the lock-up at 3.40pm.
Ong was called as a defence witness and gave supportive testimony for the appellant. He said that, at the material time, he shared a cell with the appellant in the lock-up at the Central Police Station. The appellant told him that he had been assaulted by the CNB officers and showed him the redness and bruise in his stomach. He called the police and, thereafter, he retreated to leave the appellant to talk to the police. He did not hear the conversation. The police did nothing.
At the end of the voir dire, the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the prosecution and defence in great detail and evaluated it thus. First, on the alleged deprivation of food and assault by NO Porter and NO Lim, he found inconsistencies in the appellant`s evidence. He held that if it were true that the appellant was assaulted continuously for 15-25 minutes, a reasonable reaction from the appellant would have been that he would sign anything if they stopped assaulting him. That was not what the appellant said; the appellant said that if they gave him food he would sign whatever they wanted from him. The trial judge accepted NO Porter`s evidence that he recorded in his diary that food was provided to the appellant at 7.00pm and this was not challenged. The only meal the appellant missed was lunch and that, the trial judge held, in the rush of an on-going investigation was of no significant consequence.
Secondly, on the question of assault, the trial judge held that the appellant had failed to complain to PC Abdul Nazir and W/CP Ong Peck Geok, the officers-in-charge at the Central Police Station`s lock-up, on his return to the lock-up although he claimed he was in great pain; one would reasonably expect him to complain and seek medical attention if the assault and pain had been as severe as he had made it out to be. The trial judge also found his other evidence relating to the assault incongruous and that he was not telling the truth. As for the evidence of Ong, the trial judge found that, save for supporting `the main strands` of the appellant`s allegations, Ong`s evidence was very thin on details and differed from the appellant`s on several material points and in one material point there was a sharp contradiction between the two. The trial judge was of the view that there was little doubt that the medical staff of the prison would have allowed the appellant to see a doctor if he had alleged assault at the police station and was in pain. The trial judge said: 
 
I was of the opinion, in the circumstances, that the accused was untruthful 
 in alleging the assaults
 at the eleventh hour and the contradictions in his evidence and his conduct and behaviour after the alleged assault and the evidence of his witness totally lacked credibility and his allegations did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind of their truthfulness in respect of the said assault.
 
 
 
On the alleged fabrication of the s 121 statement, the trial judge stated that he was thoroughly unimpressed with the appellant`s allegations. The most damning piece of evidence against the appellant, the trial judge held, was the appellant`s own allegation that the statement had been completely fabricated by NO Porter, as he had told NO Porter to type what he wanted and that he would sign it. It was a fact that the statement contained detailed information about the appellant`s personal background which he later admitted to be true, and which were thus incapable of fabrication by NO Porter. The trial judge was of the view that the appellant had realized this in cross-examination and had come up with the story that NO Porter, when typing the statement, referred to the `piece of paper, 8.5"" by 5""`, which must have contained details of his personal particulars that he had revealed to Insp Moh when giving his s 122(6) statement earlier that afternoon, and with which Insp Moh must have provided NO Porter. The trial judge accepted the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim as being frank and truthful and disbelieved the appellant`s version of the events.
The trial judge rejected the appellant`s allegation that the document typed by NO Porter which he had signed had blanks in the spaces for date, time and name of recording officer, which had since been filled in falsely, since the appellant had admitted he could not read English, and when he was shown the statement at the trial, he said that all he could recognize on the document was his name, `Lim`.
The trial judge further rejected the appellant`s allegation that Insp Moh had taken him out from the lock-up merely to read the statement over to him; if the statement had been made earlier and had already been signed by the appellant as alleged, then obviously there was no need for further co-operation from the appellant. Equally unlikely was the appellant`s account of his spending the length of time between 11.50am until 3.40pm merely chatting with Insp Moh, and eating cakes and drinking tea.
The trial judge accordingly held that the s 121 statement was made voluntarily and admitted it in evidence. The content of the statement, so far as material, was as follows. The appellant admitted to agreeing with one Seow Kia to smuggle drugs into Singapore from Johor Bahru for $4,500 per pound. Seow Kia had contacted him through a pager which his friend Ah Seong (a Singaporean drug purchaser) had given him. The appellant met Seow Kia at Beauty World in Upper Bukit Timah at 8pm on 18 June 1991, and agreed to meet him with the drugs at the bus-stop in Woodlands at 10.30am the next day. The appellant then returned to Johor Bahru to look for a heroin supplier he knew by the name Seow Chern. He found Seow Chern at the Cathay Cinema shortly after 9 pm; Seow Chern had heroin wrapped in newspaper stored behind the driver`s seat of his car, and was able to meet the appellant`s request for heroin. The appellant left with the drugs for Singapore the next morning at 9am. He took a lift down to the Woodlands checkpoint from a fellow lorry driver, and then took a taxi from there to the bus-stop where he had arranged to meet Seow Kia. He put the bag containing the drugs on the bus-stop seat `as a precautionary measure` and sat on the railings at the rear of the bus-stop. Ten minutes later, he was arrested by the CNB officers.
In his defence, the appellant maintained that he had nothing to do with the drugs found at the bus-stop and that he merely happened to have come upon them there. He testified that, on the morning of 19 June 1991, he left his home in Kulai for the Nam Hong Plywood Factory (`the factory`) in Jurong, Singapore, to make enquiries as to whether the factory needed sawdust. His employer had been supplying the factory with sawdust for seven years, but had since stopped; the appellant claimed that he had in view the setting up of his own business and supplying the factory himself. He said he drove from Kulai but parked his car in Johor Bahru and hitched a ride from across the Causeway to the factory from a fellow lorry driver known as `Ah Pui`.
When the appellant reached the factory, he spoke to an employee known as `Ismail`, although he did not go to see the factory manager, `Gan`. He first said that it was too early; then he said that it was pointless to see Gan as he had not bought his lorry yet. He stated he left the factory at 9.30am and had a cup of tea at a canteen next door. There, he met a pick-up driver who gave him a lift to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road so that he could take the Service 170 bus back to Johor Bahru.
As the appellant approached the bus-stop, seven or eight passengers were boarding a bus. When he reached the bus-stop, the appellant noticed a white plastic bag had been left on the middle seat. He thought that it had been left behind by one of the passengers who had got onto the bus, which had since moved off, leaving him alone at the stop. Out of curiosity he touched and then opened the bag, thinking it contained a ladies` wallet; inside, he saw a newspaper wrapped bundle which he also opened and saw something like salt. He said that he had replaced the bag on the seat and was sitting on the bus-stop railings when he was arrested by CNB officers. He maintained that, instead of immediately handcuffing him, the officers first insisted that he pick up the plastic bag and take a look inside; they told him it was drugs.
The appellant denied having had at any time possession of the bag; he asserted that the inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement were fabricated and untrue. He denied knowing the persons Seow Kia, Seow Chern and Ah Seong.
The defence called one Sheo Poh Hong who had given the appellant a lift from the factory to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road. This witness testified that the appellant did not carry a white plastic bag when he met the appellant at the canteen. However, his account of the circumstances surrounding the meeting that morning was regarded by the trial judge as being `highly improbable`, differing from the appellant`s at material points. He also admitted to meeting the appellant next at Queenstown Remand Prison, and admitted that he recognized the appellant and remembered the incident when he was reminded by the appellant.
The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant`s possession of the white plastic bag containing the drugs had been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the following: the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, the fingerprint evidence, and the main inculpatory parts of the s 121 statement, in which the appellant admitted to possession of the drugs and to transporting them from Johor Bahru to the bus-stop at Woodlands Road to deliver them to Seow Kia. He said: 
 
Having thus reviewed and assessed the whole evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case in respect of the basic ingredient of possession by the accused of the plastic bag with the diamorphine in it beyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the presumed facts under the Misuse of Drugs Act that the accused had knowledge of the diamorphine in the plastic bag and additionally, the presumed facts that the accused, having more than 2g of diamorphine, was presumed to be trafficking in it, in combination with the proved facts, amongst which was the offer of delivery by the accused as stated in the charge, had not been rebutted by the accused.
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant took issue with the admission of the s 121 statement and contended that the trial judge erred in finding that the s 121 statement had been made voluntarily. He advanced two main arguments against such finding. First, he submitted that that part of the judgment in which the trial judge held that the appellant had been `untruthful in alleging the assaults at the eleventh hour`, ie only at trial, was unfair to the appellant, since a copy of the s 121 statement was given to defence counsel only three days before the commencement of the trial, and the appellant could not have raised the allegations of assault earlier; the appellant did not know, and would not have known, whether the prosecution intended to rely on the s 121 statement until the trial itself.
We think that counsel had misunderstood that part of the judgment. The trial judge in holding that the appellant raised the allegation of assault at the `eleventh hour` was not referring to the fact that the allegations had not been made earlier in the proceedings, such as at the preliminary inquiry, but the fact that the allegations or complaints had not been made to the officers on duty at the lock-up at the Central Police Station immediately after the alleged assault or soon thereafter at any time as would have been reasonably expected of a person so assaulted in police custody. The trial judge was fully aware that a copy of the s 121 statement was given to the defence shortly before trial commenced. At the commencement of the trial, defence counsel asked for an adjournment on the ground, inter alia, that a copy of the s 121 statement was furnished to him shortly before the trial and he required time to take instructions from the appellant. This request received sympathetic consideration from the trial judge and an adjournment was granted to defence counsel to take instructions from the appellant. In our judgment, this argument had no merit, and we rejected it.
We now turn to the second main argument advanced on behalf of the appellant. It was contended that adverse inferences should have been drawn from the failure of Insp Moh (i) to ensure that an interpreter was present while he was taking the s 121 statement from the appellant, and (ii) to send the appellant for a medical examination both before and after the making of the statement. Counsel pointed out that both these safeguards had been taken by Insp Moh when the appellant made his s 122(6) statement. Under cross-examination, Insp Moh explained that medical examinations before and after the s 122(6) statement were `a procedural requirement ... but not [for] s 121`. Counsel submitted that this was an arbitrary distinction, as s 121 statement carried the same evidentiary weight as s 122(6) statement, and as, particularly, the purpose for having the requirement of pre- and post-statement medical examinations was to ensure that an accused had not been assaulted and compelled to give the statement. Counsel accordingly urged us to draw the inference, to the extent that a reasonable doubt would be raised, that Insp Moh, who was an experienced and prudent officer, failed to ensure the presence of an interpreter (who would have been an independent person) at the time the statement was recorded, because the statement had already been prepared, and that he failed to send the appellant for medical examinations before and after the taking of the statement, because the examinations would have revealed the assaults on the appellant. Counsel submitted that the explanations given by Insp Moh of his behaviour, taken with the corroborating evidence of Ong, were sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the trial judge`s mind as to the voluntariness of the statement.
Although we could see the force of counsel`s argument, we are not persuaded that the trial judge`s finding was in error. The evidence before him was not solely that of Insp Moh. There was also the evidence of NO Porter, Insp Krishnan and NO Lim. The trial judge had considered with great care the evidence of NO Porter, Inspector Krishnan and NO Lim, and found that their evidence was frank and truthful; he disbelieved the evidence of the appellant on the alleged assault and fabrication of the s 121 statement. The trial judge had also considered carefully the evidence of Insp Moh, who had been vigorously cross-examined as to why there were no pre- and post-statement medical examinations and why there was no interpreter around at the material time, and he had accepted Insp Moh`s evidence. The trial judge had seen and heard these witnesses and he had evaluated their evidence. In our judgment, the trial judge was well entitled on the evidence before him to reach the conclusion that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement had been made voluntarily.
We revert to the facts in the instant case. Although the trial judge considered that possession had been made out by the evidence taken as a whole, we were of the opinion that, even without the s 121 statement, the evidence of NO Juahir, Cpl Wong and NO Ho, who had seen the appellant carrying the bag and placing it on the middle seat at the bus-stop, and the expert evidence of the appellant`s fingerprint on the paper bag - all this evidence was unassailable - would have constituted sufficient evidence to raise a strong inference that the appellant knew the contents of the paper bag and, therefore, had possession of the drugs found there, and he had not given any explanation as to the contents of the bag which was accepted by the trial judge. On this point, we would refer to the oft-quoted passage of the speech of Lord Pearce in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
1 at pp 305-306: 
 
... If a man is in possession of the contents of a package, prima facie his possession of the package leads to the strong inference that he is in possession of its contents. But can this be rebutted by evidence that he was mistaken as to its contents? ... Thus the prima facie assumption is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents.
 
 
 
More apposite to the facts in this case is the following passage of the judgment of this Court in 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
, at p 52, where Wee Chong Jin CJ said: 
 
With regard to the question of possession of the contents of the plastic bag, it is submitted that the trial judges should have drawn the inference from her evidence that she did not in fact know what was contained inside the plastic bag. In our opinion there was no plausible evidence before the trial judges to require them to draw the inference that she was an innocent custodian of the contents of the plastic bag. Indeed, even if there were no statutory presumptions available to the prosecution, once the prosecution had proved the fact of physical control or possession of the plastic bag and the circumstances in which this was acquired by and remained with the second appellant, the trial judges would be justified in finding that she had possession of the contents of the plastic bag within the meaning of the Act unless she gave an explanation of the physical fact which the trial judges accepted or which raised a doubt in their minds that she had possession of the contents within the meaning of the Act.
 
 
 
That precisely was what had happened in this case. The appellant was in physical possession and control of the plastic bag; he was found carrying the plastic bag on the way to the bus-stop and then placing the bag on the middle seat at the bus-stop and his left thumb print was found on the plastic bag and drugs were found in the plastic bag. A strong inference irresistibly arose that he knew the contents of the bag, and he had not given `any explanation of the physical fact` which the trial judge accepted or which raised a doubt in his mind. His evidence that that was not his bag and that he had nothing to do with it was rejected, and the trial judge was justified in rejecting it. Once possession was proved, as, in our opinion, it had been proved in this case, the presumption of trafficking in the drugs under s 17 of the Act arose which the appellant had to rebut on a balance of probabilities, and he had failed to rebut it.

Cur Adv Vult
 
Before the High Court the respondent, Victor Rajoo (the accused), faced five charges, namely: (i) a charge of abduction of a lady, whom we shall call `AB`, with intent that she might be forced to illicit sexual intercourse, an offence punishable under s 366 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (the Code); (ii) a charge of having carnal intercourse with AB against the order of nature, an offence punishable under s 377 of the Code; (iii) a charge of rape of AB and putting her in fear of hurt to herself, an offence punishable under s 376(2)(b) of the Code; (iv) a charge of robbery of $6000 from AB, an offence punishable under s 392 of the Code; and (v) a charge of theft of other items belonging to AB under s 379 of the Code. The accused claimed trial to the first four charges but pleaded guilty to the fifth charge, namely, that of theft. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge acquitted him of the first and third charges, but convicted him of the second charge and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of six months and a fine of two thousand dollars. In respect of the fourth charge, the accused was acquitted of the charge of robbery but was convicted on an amended charge of theft under s 379 of the Code and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run consecutively to the term of six months. In respect of the theft charge to which the accused pleaded guilty, he was convicted and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run concurrently with the term of imprisonment passed on the amended fourth charge.
The Public Prosecutor now appeals against the decision of the learned trial judge in acquitting the accused of the first and third charges and in amending the fourth charge to one of theft and convicting the accused of that charge. It is necessary in this appeal to set out in some detail the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence respectively and to deal with it at some length.
 The prosecution case
We turn first to the evidence of AB, the complainant. She is an Indian national, aged 44 years, and was at the material time in Singapore on a social visit pass. She is married with two children and does trading business for a living. She came to Singapore to purchase goods for her business sometime in January 1995, but that was not her first visit. During that visit, she stayed at a lodging house at No 28, Veerasamy Road. She bought some hair clips and sunglasses to sell them in Sri Lanka.
On 22 January 1995 at about 11am, AB was walking along Hampshire Road carrying two plastic bags which contained her various personal effects and other items. A motor van driven by the accused, who was dressed in a long sleeved sports shirt and bermuda shorts, came and stopped next to her. The accused asked AB whether she was from India and also where she had just come from, and she replied that she had gone to see someone to collect some money. The accused asked whether she had a visa, to which she replied in the affirmative. He then asked to see her visa and also demanded her passport. In response she asked who he was, and he replied that he was a police officer. When she said that he did not look like a police officer, he claimed that he was from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). She did not believe him and asked him to show his identification card. He flashed a card to identify himself but quickly put it back into his pocket. She then believed the accused`s claim that he was a police officer and handed over her passport as demanded, and told him that she would be returning to India the following day. He examined the passport and claimed that he had checked her at the airport police station two weeks ago, and that she had come to Singapore on a different passport. The accused then asked her to board his van so that he could bring her to the airport police station for an investigation. He said that after the investigation he would release her. When she refused to board the van, the accused threatened to handcuff her. On hearing this, she was frightened and boarded the van.
The accused drove the van along Serangoon Road, passed Sim Lim Towers and drove all the way towards the Changi Airport. After having travelled for about half an hour, the accused stopped the van. He then pointed to a building and told AB that that was where the police station was located. The accused told AB to go and sit in the rear compartment of the van, and explained that when police officers were bringing in someone for questioning, they were not supposed to have the person seated in the front cabin. AB left her two plastic bags in front and went into the rear compartment.
After AB had gone into the rear compartment, the van travelled for a short distance and went over a very bumpy road. At this point AB was concerned and she asked the accused in sign language after tapping at the window separating the two compartments where he was heading. The accused pointed his index finger at her and she assumed that he was going to answer a call of nature. When the van stopped, she noticed that there were a lot of trees around. It was `like a jungle area`.
The accused then went into the rear compartment, sat near the side door, removed his shoes and told AB that he had to check her. She told him to bring her to the police station and have a female officer to check her. The accused refused. AB became frightened. The accused then pulled at her saree, and as a result the saree came off. She pleaded with the accused. The accused abused her and instead pulled off her petticoat. He then ordered her to remove her blouse and brassiere. When she refused, the accused placed his hands on her neck and told her that he would kill her and throw her into the bushes. AB became frightened and therefore complied. The accused then undressed himself and went towards AB. She sat on the floorboard to avoid him and at this stage, the accused stepped on her ankle and repeated that he would kill her if she resisted. The accused then forced AB to submit to performing an act of fellatio on him (the subject of the second charge). AB accordingly did what she was told. Following that the accused raped her.
Thereafter, the accused handed AB her clothes and as she was dressing he noticed a knot at one end of her saree. He took the saree, untied the knot and found S$6,000 in it and took the money. AB tried to snatch it back but he pushed her away, and as a result she fell. After they had dressed, he went back to the driver`s seat and she followed him. He asked her to shut the rear compartment door. She went into the rear compartment. She then saw a card and delivery order attached to a flower basket in the van. She took the card and delivery order. When she alighted from the van, she went to the rear of the van and noted the vehicle number, `YG 1496M`. She then went to the front of the vehicle to confirm the number. By this time the accused had started to drive off with AB`s two bags still in the van at the front. She then went out to the main road and flagged for help from passing vehicles. Eventually, a car driven by one Simon Tay Seong Chee, a lecturer with the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, came along. With Simon Tay in the car were his wife, Siow Jin Hua, and a friend. They found AB in distress and brought her to the nearest police station, the airport police station. Inside the car, she borrowed a pen and scribbled `YG 1496M` on a piece of paper.
Simon Tay and his wife both gave evidence. Simon Tay testified that at the material time he was driving his motor car SBA 2180X from Changi Village with his wife seated next to him and a friend on the rear seat. Whilst travelling along Changi Coast Road, a short distance from the SIA hangars and somewhere near the entrance leading to a construction site, he saw a female Indian standing on the road `waving her arms in the air, using her hands to beat her chest` and trying to flag the passing vehicles. At first Simon Tay drove past her but immediately slowed down and observed from the rear mirror that she was in distress. After a brief consultation with his wife and his friend he turned around, drove up to her and stopped beside her. He noticed that AB was distressed and emotional, and uttered some words in broken English to the effect that someone had taken her passport, money and air ticket. She said that she was from India and needed help. She kept repeating `police` as she could hardly speak English. Realizing that she needed help Simon Tay asked her to board the car. She boarded the car and sat on the rear seat. She asked for a piece of paper and pen. Siow Jin Hua gave her a pen and she wrote down several numbers on a portion of a newspaper which was in the car. Throughout the journey she kept on talking in broken English and Simon Tay came to understand that the culprit had taken her things and had identified himself as a policeman. On reaching the police station, Simon Tay referred her to some police officers. She became more distressed and started crying.
Siow Jin Hua confirmed in substance what her husband said. She also said that AB was very upset, spoke very incoherently and cried and gestured a great deal.
At the Airport Police Division Headquarters on that day the police officer, Abdul Karim bin Senin, was on duty when AB was brought in by Simon Tay. According to Abdul Karim, AB upon entering the report room started to cry, and `due to her emotional state`, he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her. He therefore sought the assistance of Staff Sergeant AR Rajagopal and contacted the latter, who was then on duty at Changi Airport Terminal 2. S/Sgt Rajagopal spoke to AB over the telephone and interviewed her. After that, S/Sgt Rajagopal briefed Abdul Karim on the facts of the case and the latter transcribed in the station diary what S/Sgt Rajagopal had told him. The information as recorded was as follows: 
 
... She was raped and robbed by a male Indian, aged 28 to 30 years old. Dark complexion, hair touching collar and wearing white T-shirt with bermuda shorts, black sandals and left ear with two studs. She was picked up by him at Sim Lim Tower and brought her to Changi Coast Road, raped and robbed. Cash $6,000, luggage and a passport. The subject was in a white van No YG1496M ...
 
 
 
Abdul Karim then referred AB to ASP Teo Chor Leng of Bedok Police Station Headquarters.
S/Sgt Rajagopal testified that when he interviewed AB on the telephone in Tamil she was emotional and was crying. AB actually mentioned the robbery first. He asked her to be forthcoming and not to hide anything. She was very emotional and was crying and hysterical. He managed to gather from her that an unknown male Indian in a van YG 1496M had raped her and then robbed her of $6000, her passport and luggage. After the interview he briefed Abdul Karim of the facts. Later on the same day, S/Sgt Rajagopal went to Airport Police Division Headquarters to act as an interpreter to ASP Teo Chor Leng, when the latter interviewed AB. At that time, she handed to ASP Teo the delivery order and congratulatory card from Noel Gift International Ltd, which she took from the rear compartment of the van.
ASP Teo confirmed that on that day he interviewed AB with the assistance of S/Sgt Rajagopal, and gathered from her that she had been raped and robbed at Changi Coast Road and that the culprit was a male Indian and had escaped in a motor van YG 1496M. AB handed to him a Noel Gift International Ltd delivery order and a congratulatory card. ASP Teo said that AB was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
The investigating officer was Inspector Deep Singh, attached to the organized crime branch of the CID. He took over the investigation from ASP Teo. On 24 January 1995 he recorded two statements from the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (s 122(6) statements) in answer to the charges of rape and robbery respectively. These statements were admitted in evidence after a voir dire held to determine that the accused had made them without any inducement, threat or promise. The s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape was as follows: 
 
I admit that I brought her. We went in a vehicle. I do not frighten her but I told her that I was a policeman. When she heard this she became frightened. I asked her for her passport. I then told her to go behind the vehicle. When I told her this, she told me that she knew why I told her this. I do not know why she said this. It may be because I told her that I am a policeman. I did not force her or persuade to do this. I wanted to have sex with her that is why I told her to go behind the vehicle. The reason she agreed to follow because I told her I am a policeman. I did not beat or threatened her.
 
 
 
The s 122(6) statement in answer to the charge for robbery was a short one, which was as follows: 
 
I admit committing the offence of robbery. I plead for leniency.
 
 
 
For the purpose of this appeal only the following parts of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh are relevant. He testified, inter alia, that on 31 January 1995 the accused led him to the scene of the crime, off Changi Coast Road. The accused also led him to a spot at the side of the road which is about 70m from Changi Ferry Road. There, he told Inspector Deep Singh that that was where he stopped his van and asked his victim to alight from the front cabin and board the rear compartment of the van. He also told the inspector that that was where he (the accused) pointed the SIA Engineering Building to the victim as the building where Changi Airport Police Station was located, which was their destination.
Inspector Deep Singh also made an investigation concerning AB. He went to No 28 Veerasamy Road and ascertained that AB at that time was staying in a room there. He found an assortment of hair clips and sunglasses in her room. He also ascertained that goods had indeed been bought by AB from several shops in Singapore. At two of the shops, the staff recognized her and confirmed she had made purchases from them regularly. In fact, he also managed to obtain copies of two receipts of those purchases from one of the shops. One of the receipts bore her name.
One, Terrence Tan Choon How, the manager of a company or firm Pacific Polythene, testified that the accused was one of the company`s employees at the material time. The accused`s job was to deliver goods of the company and had been entrusted the company`s van No YG 1496M. He confirmed that on 22 January 1995 the van was in the accused`s custody, and that besides the accused Tan himself was the only person holding a key to the van.
Lim Phay Inn Suzanne, the transport supervisor of Noel Gift International Ltd, gave evidence on the delivery order and the congratulatory card which AB took from the rear compartment of the van. Lim said that her company employed Guan Delivery Services for delivery of company`s gifts and the accused was a part time staff of Guan Delivery Services. She said that on 22 January 1995 at about 10.40am the accused left her office with a gift item for delivery to one Susan Hoong of No 6 Sin Min Plaza #04-09. She also confirmed that the delivery order and gift card produced to her subsequently by Inspector Deep Singh on 16 May 1995 were the delivery order and gift card used by her company and were attached to the gift item which the accused was supposed to deliver to Susan Hoong.
 The defence case
The accused gave evidence in his defence, and his evidence was this. On 22 January 1995, as he was driving the van along Hampshire Road approaching the junction of Rutland Road, he saw AB on the other side of the road. He called out to her and signalled to her to go over to him. In response she gestured to him to go to her instead. He thereupon turned his van around and drove up to her and stopped by her side. He asked her where she was going and in reply she said that she was going to her room. He then asked whether they could go to the room. She said that her room was at Veerasamy Road. He asked her to board his van and she did so. Neither of them indicated at that point where they would be heading, but the accused drove past Veerasamy Road along Race Course Road, Serangoon Road and Kitchener Road. When the van passed Veerasamy Road, AB gave no indication that she wished to be let off. During the journey they continued chatting and the subject turned on the bags that AB was carrying with her and her selling of sarees. The accused continued driving and eventually took his van to East Coast Parkway. They were chatting casually. He asked whether she was afraid as she was selling things such as gold and sarees. She said she was not afraid and asked whether he was a policeman. He replied that he was not. Later in the course of the conversation pertaining to her trips to and from India she produced her passport and gave it to him to have a look. The accused looked at it and then placed it on the dashboard. Finally, they reached Changi Coast Road where the accused stopped the van. There he asked AB to alight and get into the rear compartment of the van and informed her that he would take her to the place where they would have sexual intercourse. He then drove a short distance to a vacant land where he parked the van. He got down and joined her in the rear compartment.
The accused said that when he entered the rear compartment, AB was seated, and she asked him: `Why come all the way here? If you have said we could have gone to a room`. To that he replied: `We are already here, we have already arrived here, we will be here`. He said that they would `sleep` there - by that he meant having sexual intercourse - to which she agreed. He then asked her to undress. AB was initially bashful, as it was bright but she was quickly persuaded by him that no one would see them. After she had undressed herself, she asked the accused why he had not similarly done so; so he too undressed himself. He asked if she would `suck`. Without saying a word, she picked up a cloth beside them, wiped his penis and performed oral sex. They then had sexual intercourse. Thereafter, while she was dressing, he noticed a knot at one end of her saree and asked to see it, and on untying it he found some Singapore currency. He took the money without counting and put it into his right pocket. She tried to snatch it back from him but failed. In the process, she ripped off part of his pocket, lost her balance, and fell into a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. He then got out and told her to go to the front passenger seat and that he would then return her the money. She indicated that she wanted to stay in the rear compartment. He then reversed his van to get out of the vacant land. While doing so he saw through the side mirror AB jumping out of the van and running to the main road. He tried to call her but when he saw her waving to passing vehicles he got frightened and drove off.
With regard to his s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape, the accused said that he did not tell AB that he was a policeman. What he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she brought in gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. In respect of the s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of robbery he said that he was guilty of theft.
 Decision below
The learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the accused as being closer to the truth. He found that the accused came across as an honest witness, and he did not believe AB when she said that she thought that the silver panelled van was a police vehicle. He was also not convinced that her business of selling mangoes for a profit of $75 justified her trip to Singapore. The learned trial judge noted, however, that on this particular trip, she brought nothing to sell, but purchased hair clips and sunglasses for sale in Colombo. He was, therefore, sceptical about the profits she could make there. He could not say with certainty if the latter was the real purpose of her visit to Singapore. AB conveyed an impression that she was not entirely forthright.
The learned trial judge also noted that no weapon was used in any way. There was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB. The only damage was to the accused`s pocket when AB tried to snatch back her money. The learned trial judge expressed surprise that AB who did not put up any resistance when she was raped as alleged, would find the courage or strength to resist when her money was being taken. Her distress when Simon Tay found her appeared to be over the loss of her money. She herself testified that she repeated `Help! Police! Cheating!` to Simon Tay and his wife. She did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. No attempt was made to flee from the accused until after her money had been taken from her. Her disposition and character before and up to the rape was in marked contrast to that displayed the moment the accused took her $6,000. The evidence as a whole, had not only created a doubt in the learned trial judge`s mind t hat AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but also convinced him that in all probability she did consent. He said: 
 
The evidence as a whole, has not only created a doubt in my mind that AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but I am convinced that in all probability she did consent.
 
 
 
The prosecution has therefore, not proved that AB was abducted for illicit sexual intercourse or that the accused had sexual intercourse with AB without her consent. Accordingly, I acquitted the accused of the first and third charges.
Turning to the fourth charge of robbery of the sum of $6,000, the learned trial judge held thus: 
 
In respect of the fourth charge of robbery of the $6,000, it was clear in the evidence that the threat of death or hurt or the wrongful restraint if at all (which I found otherwise) related only to the sexual acts. The taking of the money was an off-chance. It came about, even from the evidence of AB, when she was dressing up, the accused found the money and took it. This cannot fall within the definition of `Robbery` under s 390. In this regard, I accept the evidence of the accused that he did not push AB when she tried to snatch the money from him. It is a case of theft simpliciter under s 378. I, therefore, convicted the accused accordingly, and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for two years.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
The appeal is essentially against the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. Basically there are three main issues: first, whether AB was induced by deception on the part of the accused to travel in the accused`s van; second, whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused; and third, whether the accused put AB in any fear of hurt to herself when the accused took the sum of $6000 from her by force. The first is relevant to the charge of abduction; the second to the charge of rape; and the third to the charge of robbery.
In a case such as this, there was obviously a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and that of the accused. The learned trial judge, who had had the benefit of seeing and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the learned trial judge`s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision. In at pp 333-334, Lai Kew Chai J delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
... In a case such as the instant case, where there were two directly contradictory versions the acceptance or rejection of which significantly depended on the oral testimony of the protagonists, the role of the appellate court is clear. We have to accord to the findings of facts of the learned trial judge the greatest respect and ought not disturb them unless we are satisfied that the learned trial judge had reached a wrong decision and that in the context of this case `any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge`s conclusion`: see the speech of Lord Thankerton in 
[1947] AC 484
, at p 488, reported under the name of or .
 
 
 
Pronouncements to similar effect were made by this court in , at p 42 and , at p 5. Having said this, nonetheless, it is incumbent on us to examine the basis of the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge and his reasons therefor and consider whether the findings were against the weight of evidence and insupportable.
We turn first to the primary facts which have been established and which are not in dispute. The accused, prior to the morning of 22 January 1995, was not acquainted with AB at all. On that day, while driving along Hampshire Road he saw AB on the opposite side. He accosted her and drove up to her side. A conversation then took place, and he requested her to board the van which she did. He then drove the van all the way to Changi Coast Road. Somewhere along that road, he stopped the van and asked her to alight and go to the rear compartment, and she complied. He then drove the van further and stopped at an isolated spot and parked the van there. After that he went to the rear compartment, and there, three important events took place. First, at his request AB performed the fellatio on him; second, they had sexual intercourse; and third, as she was dressing up, he found some money of hers tied in a knot in her saree and he took the money against her will. After she had dressed up and the accused had left the rear compartment, she picked up a delivery order and a card attached to a flower basket and kept them. She came down from the van and noted the number of the van. She then went to the main road and flagged down passing vehicles for help. She was picked up by Simon Tay driving his car who had with him his wife and a friend. They took her to a police station, where she made a report.
It is now necessary to consider and test the evidence of AB and the accused respectively against the undisputed facts and other evidence before us. AB`s evidence, in substance, was that she was going about her business on the morning of 22 January 1995, and along Hampshire Road she was accosted by the accused who drove a van and stopped by her side. The accused told her that he was a police officer and asked for her visa and passport. She produced her passport and gave it to him; he inspected it and then placed it on the front dashboard and asked her to board the van as he was going to bring her in for further investigation. She believed him and under the threat of being handcuffed by him she boarded the van. On the other hand, the accused`s evidence was that he accosted her, asked her where she was going and on hearing that she was going to her room in Veerasamy Road suggested that they should go to her room. He then asked her to board the van and she did so willingly.
Considering purely the respective evidence of AB and the accused, we have difficulty in accepting what the accused said. If his evidence is tested against the primary facts which are uncontroverted, and other evidence it is even more incredible. The accused was a total stranger to AB; he accosted her by the road side. She was not at the material time standing by the road side accosting or trying to accost any man coming along, or for that matter any passer-by, male or female. She was going about in her business and was going to her destination, whether it be her room in Veerasamy Road or elsewhere. AB`s evidence, on the other hand, was more consistent with the primary facts.
Next, there was the s 122(6) statement of the accused made in answer to the charge of rape. It was not in dispute that the accused made this statement voluntarily. What he disputed was the content of the statement. He said he did not tell AB that he was a policeman and that what he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she had brought gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. Both Inspector Deep Singh, the investigating officer, and B Jeyaletchumi, the interpreter, were called and were cross-examined on what the accused had said. The learned trial judge reached the following conclusion: 
 
The interpreter, Jeyaletchumi, was cross-examined and she said she could not remember if the accused`s version in court was what he told her on 24 January 1995. I have noted that the statement was translated by her `sentence by sentence`. However, she appeared to me to be unsure and was not prepared to say categorically that the accused`s version was not true or wrong. The accused impressed me as an honest witness and I am, therefore, giving him the benefit of the doubt. Furthermore, he did say explicitly, that he did not `force her or persuade` AB to have sex nor did he `beat or threaten` her. It is to be remembered that the charge (in P53) to which this statement relates alleges that he `put the said [AB] in fear of hurt to herself`.
 
 
 
With respect, we have difficulty in accepting this conclusion. First, Jeyaletchumi`s role was only that of a translator: translating what the accused said in Tamil into English, and vice versa. That statement was recorded on 24 January 1995. It is not possible to expect her to remember and testify in court some five months later whether the accused`s version in court was what he said to her in January 1995. Nor could she testify whether `categorically` or otherwise `that the accused`s version was not true or wrong`. All she could say, and did say, was that she translated what the accused said in Tamil into English. She said that the statement was recorded sentence by sentence and she translated sentence by sentence. She further testified that the statement was read back and translated to the accused and he did not indicate that he wished to make any correction. It is obvious to us that she relied on that statement to refresh her memory. We can find no basis for saying that the s 122(6) statement did not correctly record what the accused had said. Secondly, with regard to that part of the s 122(6) statement, which said: `I did not beat or threatened (sic) her`, it is an exculpatory statement, and the learned trial judge appeared to have accepted it presumably on the basis that the accused impressed him as an honest witness. Again, such evidence must be tested against the primary facts and other evidence before the court.
There is one aspect of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh which corroborates the fact that the accused had misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman. After his arrest, the accused led Inspector Deep Singh to the spot at Changi Coast Road, where he said he pointed to AB the SIA Engineering Building as the building in which the Changi Airport Police Station was located and to which they would be going. The truth of this evidence had never been denied by the accused at any stage of the trial. If the accused had not misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman, it is irrelevant whether that building is where the police station is located and there is no purpose of their going there.
We now turn to another aspect of the evidence of AB and the accused. It was not disputed that AB had handed to the accused her passport and that the accused placed or kept it on the front dashboard on his side. The material question is when did this take place and the circumstances in which the passport was handed to the accused. AB`s evidence was that at the first encounter the accused said he was a police officer and demanded the passport and she handed it to him. The accused`s evidence, on the other hand, was that during the journey while they were travelling along East Coast Parkway, in the course of their conversation pertaining to AB making trips to and from India, AB on her own volition produced the passport and showed it to him; he looked at it and then placed it in front of the dashboard. If those were the circumstances in which the passport was produced the natural thing for him to do would be to return the passport to AB. There is no reason why AB in the midst of that conversation should on her own volition show him her passport and there is equally no reason why he should keep her passport. We again find the accused`s evidence difficult to accept and that AB`s evidence was more consistent with the uncontroverted facts and the other material evidence.
With great respect to the learned trial judge, on the whole we find AB`s evidence much closer to the truth. Our conclusion is that the accused at the first encounter must have told her that he was a policeman or an officer authorized to inspect her passport and must have demanded the production of her passport and that was the time when she handed her passport to him. Secondly, he must have ordered her to board the van on the pretext that he was a police officer and that he was bringing her in for further investigation, and in consequence she was compelled to do so by reason of the apparent authority held out by him.
We find that the accused had practised deception on her and had thereby induced her to board the van and travel with him which she otherwise would not have done so. That clearly was an act of abduction falling within the meaning of s 362 of the Penal Code, which defines abduction as follows: 
 
Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.
 
 
 
The accused had by deceitful means induced AB to board the van and brought her all the way to a spot off Changi Coast Road, to which she otherwise would not have gone.
The facts here pertaining to abduction are somewhat similar to those in . There, a young woman who had been kidnapped managed to escape and was on her way to the police station when she met the accused. The latter enquired who she was and where she was going and on hearing that she had been kidnapped and had escaped, persuaded her to go home with him saying that he was a policeman and would escort her to the 
 thana 
. He took her to his house and locked her there. He then took an earring from her and with that he went to see her mother and promised to return the girl on payment of a sum of money. It was held that the accused was guilty of abduction under s 365 of the Indian Penal Code. Broadway J said at p 160: 
 
Now when the appellant met the girl she had ceased to be a kidnapped woman in the strict sense. She was then a free agent but she would not have gone with the appellant but for his false representations to her as to his being a police constable and the inducement held out by him that he would take her to the police station. His action therefore amounted to abduction as defined in s 362 IPC.
 
 
 
Next, the accused said in his evidence that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. He abducted her with the intent that she might be compelled or be forced to having illicit intercourse with him. In our opinion, on the evidence adduced the necessary ingredients of the offence under s 366 of the Penal Code have been established beyond any reasonable doubt. We find him guilty of the first charge.
We now turn to the second main issue: whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused. We revert once again to the evidence of the accused. His testimony was that he asked AB where she was going to which she replied that she was going to her room, and he then asked whether both of them could go to the room. She said her room was at Veerasamy Road. He thereupon asked her to board the van and she did so willingly. If that was true he would have driven her to her place of abode at Veerasamy Road and would have gone to the room to have sexual intercourse with her. That was what he wanted. That, however, was not what he did. He drove the van past Veerasamy Road and brought AB to a deserted vacant land off Changi Coast Road. Next, it was his evidence that after parking the van, he went and joined her in the rear compartment of the van. He then told AB that that was where they were going to have sexual intercourse and he asked her to undress. AB willingly undressed herself and to all intents and purposes was ready and willing to have sexual intercourse with him. Indeed, AB even went further: at his mere request she willingly performed the fellatio before they had sexual intercourse. Such evidence struck us as inherently incredible. It is inconceivable that AB, a mature woman of 44 years old - that was what the learned trial judge has found - would willingly participate in such sexual activities with a man such as the accused, a total stranger, in those circumstances. Even if AB was a prostitute or a woman of loose morals, there was no reason why she would do what she did without some prior discussion or negotiation as to her reward for such services. On that aspect there was not a shred of evidence coming from him. Nor was it his evidence that during the half an hour journey from Hampshire Road to Changi Coast Road he had succeeded in charming AB, so much so that when they arrived at Changi Coast Road she had become so close and warm towards him that she was prepared at his request or on his persuasion first to perform the fellatio and thereafter to have the sexual intercourse with him. To our mind, on the evidence before us, there was no reason why she would be so willing to engage in such sexual activities with him in the rear compartment of a van, which was stuffy, warm and uncomfortable, on an isolated spot off Changi Coast Road, in broad daylight at about 12 noon. The irresistible inference is that AB was forced to submit to these outrageous indignities at his hands out of fear. True it is that there was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB, and there was no weapon used. True also that there was no struggle or physical resistance on the part of AB. However, we need hardly say that the absence of injury on the victim of a rape, though a relevant consideration, is not fatal to the charge of rape. Authorities are in abundance on this point. We need to quote only two. In at p 2169 the High Court of Orissa said, at p 2169: 
 
10 In a case of rape, consent, if any, given by the victim must be voluntary. A mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, quiescence, non-resistance, or passive giving in, when volitional faculty is either clouded by fear or vitiated by duress, cannot be deemed to be `consent`. ... But as has been observed in the case of (1980) 4 SCC 262 [1980 Cri LJ 1344], the absence of injuries on the person of the victim girl may not be fatal to the prosecution and corroborative evidence may not be an imperative component of judicial credence in rape cases.
 
 
 
In at p 162, Coomaraswamy J said: 
 
It was argued that the absence of injury tended to show consent. That is true where an accused used physical force to get the victim to submit to sexual intercourse. There was no such allegation here. [The victim] was overawed into submission by the conduct of Teo, Sim and Ng, by the whereabouts of the events, a deserted quarry on a dark night and by the presence of three men outside the cabin when the fourth was alone with her. ...
 
 
 
On the evidence before us, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that AB was overawed into submission by the conduct of the accused and the whereabouts of the crime. AB was brought to an isolated spot and was alone with the accused inside the rear compartment of the van. She was completely in his hands and was helpless. She could not possibly engage in an unarmed combat with the accused. She must have participated in all those sexual acts out of fear of the accused. The learned trial judge found AB a mature woman of 44 years old and that she is tall and heavy - a physique which the accused said appealed to him. That may be so. But the accused is no midget either. On the contrary, he too is tall and heavy (if not taller and heavier than AB), and from what we observe he is a burly young man of 27 years old with a very strong physique.
Evidence of AB`s conduct subsequent to the event was wholly consistent with and supported her evidence that she had been raped. Simon Tay`s evidence was that when he stopped his car to answer her call for help he found her to be `distressed and emotional` and that she kept uttering `police`. His wife, Siow Jin Hua, confirmed in substance what he said. Abdul Karim bin Senin, the first police officer AB saw, found her crying and he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her due to her emotional state. S/Sgt A R Rajagopal, who interviewed her over the telephone soon after she was brought to the police station, found her emotional and crying and managed to find out from her that she had been raped and robbed of a sum of $6000. ASP Teo, who interviewed her later, gathered that she had been raped and robbed and that she was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
Then there was the evidence of Dr Lai Sing Foo who examined AB some seven hours later and found her still crying during the questioning when she informed him that she had been raped and robbed. AB was apparently still in the state of anguish and distress.
If the evidence of AB is tested against all this evidence and the evidence of deception practised on her by the accused that he was a police officer and also against the incredible evidence of the accused, the conclusion is irresistible that she had been raped by the accused and had been put in fear of the accused.
The learned trial judge found it somewhat inexplicable that AB did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped at two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. With respect, we do not share that view. The explanation clearly is that until she was brought to the deserted vacant land, she was still under the impression that the accused was a police officer who had detained her passport and was bringing her in for questioning. There was therefore no reason for her to run away from a law enforcer. Indeed, on the basis of that belief to do so would be most inadvisable.
The learned trial judge`s acceptance of the accused`s evidence was based mainly on his impression of AB and the accused and the manner in which AB and the accused gave evidence. These factors are of course important and play a vital role in the determination of the veracity and credibility of their evidence. However, it is equally important to test their evidence against some objective facts and independent evidence. In at p 878 Yong Pung How CJ delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence.
 
 
 
It is also helpful to remind ourselves of what Ong Hock Thye FJ said in , at p 223: 
 
To avoid undue emphasis on demeanour, it may be well to remember what was said by Lord Wright, and often quoted, from his judgment in 
[1935] AC 243
, at p 267 of the possibility of judges being deceived by adroit or plausible knaves or by apparent innocence.
 
 
 
We now turn to the third main issue which relates to the charge of robbery. Here, we need only to revert to the evidence of the accused on how he took the money. He said that after the sexual intercourse with AB, while the latter was dressing, he noticed there was a knot tied to the saree. He had a look at it and found money in it. He took the money and put it in his pocket. AB attempted to snatch it back and in that attempt she ripped off part of his pocket and fell in a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. On that evidence, what he did was more than theft simpliciter; it was robbery. Robbery as defined in s 390(2) is as follows: 
 
Theft is `robbery` if, in order to commit theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. ...
 
 
 
Purely on his evidence the ingredients of the offence of robbery have been established. Certain degree of force must have been used by him on her to restrain her from getting back her money, which accounted for the ripping off of his pocket and her fall onto the floorboard. She did not persist in making a further attempt to get back her money and the reason was obviously that she was in fear of him. Bearing in mind that first he had forced her to submit to the sexual indignities and secondly he took her money by force the irresistible inference is that he must have caused her fear of further hurt to herself when he took her money. In our judgment, what the accused did in the circumstances amounted to robbery. We find him guilty of the charge.
In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the order made by the learned trial judge on the charges of abduction, rape and robbery. We convict the accused of the first charge of abduction under s 366, the third charge of rape under s 376(2)(b) and the fourth charge of robbery under s 392.

This was an appeal from a decision of the district judge convicting the appellant on seven charges of illegal moneylending contrary to s 8(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) (the Act) and four charges of harassment contrary to s 33(1).
Section 8(1)(b) reads: 
 
If any person ... carries on a business as a moneylender without holding a licence ... he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 and for a second or subsequent offence to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
And s 33(1) reads: 
 
Any moneylender who, personally, or by any person acting on his behalf, harasses or intimidates his debtor, any member of the debtor`s family or any other person in connection with the loan to the debtor at, or watches or besets, the residence or place of business or employment of the debtor, the member of the debtor`s family or that other person, or any place at which the debtor receives his wages or any other sum periodically due to him, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both ... .
 
 
 
A total fine of $123,000 was imposed.
After hearing the appeal, this court amended the four charges of harassment to charges of intimidation. The appeal was then dismissed save for one of the charges of intimidation. The reasons are now given.
 The prosecution`s case below 
It was alleged that the appellant had lent money illegally to Chong Chew Hua (Chong) and Ling Ing Hoi (Ling) separately on various occasions in 1994. After both Chong and Ling had failed to pay off the amounts outstanding, the appellant had harassed Goh Keng Leong (Goh), Chong`s husband, and Khoo Lea Heng (Khoo), Ling`s wife.
 Chong 
Chong was an operator of a gambling den in Lorong Ah Soo with Ling and several others. In early October 1994, she borrowed $2,000 from the appellant, which was to be paid through daily payments of $120 for 20 to 30 days. However, after making payments for just about a week, Chong, who was by this time operating a den at Bedok, borrowed another $3,000, which was to be repaid by daily sums of $180 for 20 days. Another loan of $3,000 was again taken in a week`s time, on the same terms and without repayment of the earlier loan; on this occasion Chong was at Tampines. Finally, after another week`s payments, a fourth loan of $2,000 was taken with repayment of $120 per day for 20 days. At this point, Chong was operating a den in Balestier. No payment was ever made on this loan. None of the loans made were documented.
At the end of November, Chong`s husband, Goh, said that he was paged by the appellant, who identified himself as `Ah Long`. Goh was told that his wife had failed to repay a loan of $10,000. When the appellant was informed that Chong was missing, he told Goh that the latter ought to repay the money owed. In addition, the appellant also instructed him to locate Chong. In the course of the conversation, vulgarities were used against Goh. The appellant also accused Chong of committing robbery by failing to pay the loan.
Subsequently in February 1995, while Goh was outside his flat praying, the appellant, accompanied by another person, approached Goh and identified himself as `Ah Long`. The appellant asked for the wife. Even though she was actually in the house sleeping, Goh told the appellant that Chong was not at home. Upon hearing this, the appellant instructed Goh to inform Chong to contact the appellant within three days. No threats were made on this occasion.
 Ling 
As regards Ling, the prosecution`s case was that, while he was operating a Hougang gambling den in July 1994, he had borrowed $8,000 from the appellant. Of the total principal, $3,000 was to be paid back through daily payments of $60 running until the portion was repaid, while the remaining $5,000 was to be paid by daily payments of $300 for 20 days.
After completing payments for the first loan, Ling took out another loan of $15,000. In this instance, $5,000 was to be repaid over 20 days with daily payments of $300. As for the balance of $10,000, daily interest of $200 was levied until the principal sum was repaid. Payment of the $5,000 portion was completed; the interest on the $10,000 tranche was paid for a month, but the principal sum was never repaid.
In late October 1994, Ling borrowed a further $20,000. Again the amount was separated into one tranche of $5,000 and another of $15,000. Payment for the first tranche was through daily instalments of $300 for 20 days, while for the latter tranche daily interest of $300 was charged up to the repayment of the principal. For eight to nine days, Ling paid the interest on the $5,000 but eventually stopped. No interest was paid on the $15,0000. Ling went into hiding in Johore. In none of the loans were documents signed.
In November, Khoo, Ling`s wife, was visited in the early morning by someone calling himself `Ah Long`, later identified as the appellant, and at least one other person. That person got Khoo to page for Ling, who was told that there was someone looking for him. The appellant tried to speak to Ling directly, but Khoo refused him entry.
In December, the appellant, again accompanied, visited Khoo one evening. This time they spoke through the door grilles. Khoo refused to page for Ling as requested by the appellant. The appellant informed her that Ling was indebted to him, and that, if Ling failed to pay, the debt would, in his words, remain forever. Khoo did not understand what was meant by that remark, but was scared.
 The arrest 
In January 1995, Chong returned home to find, on the landing walls graffiti in Chinese which carried her address and a demand for repayment. She made a police report. On 8 February, a meeting was arranged by Chong, at the suggestion of the police, with the appellant, at a fast food outlet at Cathay Building. When the appellant met her, he was arrested by police officers.
Upon investigation, it was found that the appellant was not a licensed moneylender.
 The defence 
The appellant in his defence stated that he was indeed owed $10,000 by Chong and $15,000 by Ling, but in both cases the amounts owed were gambling debts. In his version of events, the appellant said that in October 1994, he had gambled with Chong and Ling at the den in Balestier. Chong and Ling lost to him. At first they had paid up their debts during the course of the game, but subsequently they told him that they would have to pay him at the end of the gambling session. When it came to that point though, they further postponed repayment to the next day. The appellant understood by this that payment was to be effected at the den, although no time was specified. While normally the appellant would not have allowed others to owe him debts incurred in gambling, he thought that Chong and Ling were reliable as they were den operators. The appellant alleged that no interest was to be charged on either of the amounts.
The next day though, Chong and Ling did not turn up. The appellant tried paging Ling but got no response. In February 1995, the appellant eventually managed to get Chong`s address. Late one night in that month, at about 11pm, he went to the address alone, but only found Goh, who told him that Chong was not around. Goh was asked to contact Chong, but no such attempt was made. As no useful response could be elicited from Goh, the appellant left. The appellant claimed that no obscenities were used then.
The next day, Chong had contacted him, and arranged the meeting at which the appellant was arrested. The appellant denied approaching Ling or his family concerning the $15,000 owed to him.
In several statements made to the police, the appellant denied being an illegal moneylender and harassing anyone. In all of the statements he stated that he had been merely trying to collect gambling debts.
The appellant further explained in his defence in court that he had investments in Taiwan. On several occasions in August, September and October 1994, the appellant was abroad in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.
One Tan Bee Kin (Tan) testified for the defence. She had been employed as a worker in the gambling den, and had seen the appellant, whom she had known for about nine years, gambling there. During the last occasion when she saw the appellant together with Chong and Ling, she had ceased to work and was in fact only delivering something. She said that the appellant was there occasionally. At no time did she ever see the appellant giving loans. Her testimony was that she had heard Ling saying that he owed the appellant $1,000. Her testimony was largely the same in regard to Chong.
Another witness for the defence was Lim Lai Wah (Lim), who was a gambler and had known the appellant for about seven years. She said that the appellant was an occasional gambler. According to her, the appellant gambled with a group including her as well as Chong and Ling. During this session, the two lost heavily, and eventually told the appellant that they would pay him the next day.
 Decision below 
The judge considered that the appellant`s version did not raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case. In coming to his decision, the judge was of the opinion that both Chong`s and Ling`s evidence had to be scrutinized carefully and was conscious that both of them had been engaged in illegal activities. Nonetheless, he found that their version was credible. He considered that these witnesses could have given less elaborate versions if they had merely wanted to fabricate something.
The judge also noted that counsel for the appellant had not put the appellant`s version, namely, that the debts were gambling losses wagered during a single sitting, to either Chong or Ling. Neither was it put to Ling that the appellant was owed only $15,000 instead of $43,000.
As for the evidence of the two defence witnesses, Tan and Lim, this was considered suspect, particularly since the two were friends of the appellant. The judge noted an inconsistency in the evidence of Lim, who had said that Chong and Ling had arranged payment the next day in the course of the game, even though the appellant himself had stated that the two had only made that arrangement at the end of the game. A similar difficulty was highlighted by the judge as regards the evidence of Tan.
Further, it was considered strange that the two debtors could pay off losses due to others but not to the appellant, and that the appellant was so ready to postpone payment, without adequate safeguards. Finally, as regards the harassment, the judge found the evidence of the prosecution witnesses credible and true.
The judge therefore convicted the appellant on all 11 charges. In sentencing the appellant, it was observed that there were no relevant antecedents. The appellant`s declining to put forward anything in mitigation was also noted. It was considered that a deterrent sentence depriving the appellant of his ill-gotten gains had to be imposed. In the event a total of $123,000 in fines was imposed.
 The appeal 
The appellant`s case on appeal
It was argued that the evidence of Chong and Ling had to be treated with caution and that the judge ought to have directed his mind to the danger of convicting on their uncorroborated evidence as the two witnesses had purposes of their own to serve.
It was also argued that the fact that the two witnesses were able to give the detailed mechanics of repayment, and that Ling had described an elaborate division of loans into separate tranches was not conclusive, given that the two were engaged in illegal activities themselves. Too much emphasis was placed as well by the judge on the acquaintanceship of the defence witnesses and the appellant. The inconsistencies found by the judge in the evidence of the defence witnesses were not material or significant. It was also argued that there was nothing strange in the appellant allowing Chong and Ling to owe him money. The evidence of Goh and Khoo was also suspect as there could have been collusion between them and their respective spouses. The appellant`s visit at Chong`s home, which on his evidence was at 11pm, was not harassment simply because of the time of the visit.
The appellant pointed to the fact that Chong and Ling were gambling operators and that there were no supporting documents to indicate that his defence ought to be accepted. Also, the prosecution ought to have called as witnesses other gamblers at the dens who were present during the supposed visits by the appellant to collect money; as these were not called, a presumption that their evidence would be unfavourable to the prosecution operated. Further, the appellant argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive as the fines would be crushing, while the offences committed were not of the most serious sort.
The prosecution case
The prosecution`s arguments were directed primarily towards reiterating the findings made by the trial judge. It was also argued that the sentences were not manifestly excessive in light of various precedents.
 The issues 
The following issues arose:
 
 
(1) The evaluation of the evidence 
 
(2) Sentencing
  
 
 
No argument had been taken that the appellant was not engaged in the business of moneylending.
 The evaluation of the evidence 
The basis of the discussion of this issue will be the contentions raised by the appellant in his petition. These may be grouped as follows:
 
 
(i) the effect of the evidence of a person with an interest to serve; 
 
(ii) the acceptance by the judge of the evidence of Chong and Ling, and the rejection of that of the appellant, and his witnesses Lim and Tan; 
 
(iii) whether the appellant`s first visit to Chong`s flat amounted to harassment; and 
 
(iv) the failure of the prosecution to produce certain witnesses.
  
 
 
 
 
 The evidence of a person with an interest to serve 
 
 
 
It was argued that the judge ought to have noted that Chong and Ling had their own interests to serve in giving evidence against the appellant, that is, to avoid repayment of the supposed gambling debts. He ought then, it was said, to have looked for corroboration or be cautious in accepting that evidence. The judge`s finding that the evidence of Lim and Tan was suspect was also attacked. To determine these issues, it was necessary first to examine what approach ought to be taken as regards the evidence of persons with interests to serve.
A number of local cases have identified situations in which some caution or even corroboration is required when the witnesses concerned have interests of their own to serve. One of these is 
 Teo Thin Chan & Anor v PP 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 184
 , in which it was held that the evidence of the mother of the complainant ought not be accepted without supporting evidence. In 
 Tan Kheng Ann & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 108
 , fellow prisoners of the accused, who were charged with murder, gave evidence. The direction to the jury contained the warning that conviction upon that evidence would be dangerous unless its truth was absolutely convicting. The Federal Court, on appeal from Singapore, upheld that direction. Subsequently, Raja Azlan Shah in 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 45
  said that as regards a witness with a purpose of his own to serve, the judge would have to be wary of convicting on uncorroborated evidence. In 
Ng Kum Peng v PP
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 231
  this issue was noted but not gone into.
Most of the cases were decided before the amendments removing the need for corroboration of accomplice evidence were passed. This is an important consideration since the approach in these cases mirrored that for accomplice evidence.
Some guidance may be obtained from the law on accomplice evidence. The person with an interest to serve is in many ways akin to an accomplice - the latter too has his own interest to protect, that is, the lessening of his involvement in the crime. In relation to accomplice evidence, s 135 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) states: 
 
An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is hereby abrogated.
 
 
 
Section 116 reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The Court may presume -
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
 
(b) that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution; 
 
...
  
 
 
There is thus no requirement at present for any corroboration warning, but the evidence of an accomplice may, and indeed, generally would, be treated with caution. In light of the removal of the corroboration warning for accomplice evidence, it is not necessary either for the judge to administer himself a similar warning as regards the evidence of a person with an interest to serve, in contrast to the present position as to the evidence of victims of sexual offences and children.
It is open for the judge to so treat the evidence of an interested person with caution, but this is not a general rule. Whether caution is in fact required is very much dependent on the facts of the case. No purpose would be served by the laying down of a rigid rule. Witnesses such as relatives, or persons in an antagonistic relationship with the accused, do not necessarily attract the same caution. The purpose to be served by giving unreliable evidence has to be shown to be particularly strong before such a witness can be regarded as tainted. It is for the trial judge, upon considering the circumstances of the case, to decide whether a particular witness warrants that additional care.
So long as it is apparent that the trial judge has not accepted the evidence of witnesses akin to accomplices wholesale without scrutiny, an appellate court would be slow to interfere with his findings of fact, or his preference for one witness`s testimony over that of another.
 The evidence of Chong and Ling 
Turning now to the specific contention of the appellant, it was said that the trial judge had erred in not considering that the debtors had purposes of their own to serve. In support he cited 
 Lim Boon San v PP 
.
The judge noted that the debtors were not without blemish. He indicated therefore that he knew that the evidence of these witnesses could not be accepted without scrutiny. In any event, the circumstances of this appeal do not justify such caution as argued for by the appellant. Contrary to his contention, the avoidance of a payment of money is not such a strong motive for giving contrary evidence. Indeed, the assault alleged in 
 Ng Kum Peng 
 which the appellant sought to distinguish, would be a stronger reason for giving false evidence than the mere avoidance of payment of money. An allegation of non-payment of a wager could be easily made by any illegal moneylender.
 Acquaintanceship of Lim, Tan and the appellant 
There is no rule of law that acquaintanceship with a party to a proceeding always attracts the need for caution. The judge in giving weight to the length of their acquaintanceship must have taken that into consideration alongside the other observations he would have been able to make about their credit and veracity. It would be wrong to say that the judge had in fact decided to apply anything similar to the principle in 
 Lim Boon San 
; he was merely exercising his judgement based on a number of observations, one of which would have been the length of their acquaintanceship. He did not place undue weight on it.
Furthermore, the judge did not reject the evidence of Tan and Lim simply because they were acquaintances of the appellant - he noted that there were some incongruities in the evidence given by the two, which pointed to what was described by the judge as a taint in favour of the appellant. These will be examined in the following section.
 Preference for the prosecution evidence 
The judge preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He found that their evidence was `forthright, did not appear fabricated and [the witnesses] gave details of the various transactions involved,`. He noted that Ling had testified that the sums he had borrowed were in two tranches, with different interest and repayment rates. The judge thought that this was all too elaborate for it to be a fabrication. With respect, this is not a forceful consideration - it is conceivable that Ling would have had some experience of other illegal loans, and would have known about the loan terms of illegal moneylenders.
The judge also considered it material that the appellant`s case was not put to either Chong or Ling. This pertained to the fact that the debts were in fact gambling debts incurred at one sitting, and that the loan to Ling was not $43,000, the total of the three charges involving Ling, but only $15,000. While the failure to put a case may imply the acceptance of the opposing case (
 R v Fenlon 
 (1980) 71 Cr App R 307), it must be noted that this is not the invariable consequence. In any event, the appellant`s counsel did put the case that the debts were incurred in gambling. In relation to Chong, the cross-examination was as follows: 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] won his bets when he was the banker you did not pay him but said that you would owe him the money?
A: No.
 
 
 
As for Ling: 
 
Q: When you lost the bet with the accused, you told him that you owed him the money?
 
 
 
 
A: No. I did not gamble with him. 
 
Q: Likewise when the [appellant] played banker and you lost you did not pay the [appellant] but told him that you owed him the money? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: At the end of this gambling session you owed the [appellant] $15,000? 
 
A: No 
 
Q: Put: That you promised to repay the [appellant] the next day? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
Based on the above, the appellant`s case was adequately, though barely, put to the prosecution witnesses.
Nonetheless, the judge was entitled to find that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was credible and ought to be preferred - he had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and make his own assessment of their credibility and credit.
There was some evidence of the appellant being abroad during the period of the alleged offences. This would have put into doubt the statement of the debtors that they had been able to make daily payments everyday during the period that the appellant was away. However, this did not adversely affect the prosecution evidence for the witnesses had only given approximate dates of the taking out of the loans and repayment so it was still possible for those payments to have been made.
The two witnesses for the defence will next be dealt with. A couple of incongruities were noted by the judge. The first incongruity related to the point of time when Chong and Ling had supposedly arranged for repayment the day after the game - the appellant`s case was that this was only done at the end, but his witness, Lim, who had supposedly left before then, appeared to have testified to have personal knowledge of that. The other inconsistency was of a similar nature. Tan had testified that she had left the den before the game had ended, which the judge considered odd since she was supposedly a worker there. The explanation given by Tan that she had stopped working for the operators by then, and that she was only delivering something, appeared to the judge to be an afterthought.
As regards Tan, her testimony need not be interpreted in the manner of the judge. In cross-examination, she had testified as follows: 
 
Q: Did you know how much [Chong] and [Ling] owed the [appellant] after the last gambling session?
 
 
 
 
A: I do not know. 
 
Q: You were there until the den closed? 
 
A: No. I left home before the session ended. 
 
Q: The following day did you go back to work? 
 
A: In fact when I went to Balestier on that occasion I no longer worked for them. The purpose of visit on that occasion was to send a refrigerator to them at the gambling den.
  
 
 
Her explanation then was not so much an explanation of her leaving early, but of the fact that she had not gone back the next day. If so, this was not an afterthought on her part.
The evidence of Lim was however indeed suspect. She had testified: 
 
This session started in early afternoon and I left at about 9pm to 10pm. The session was still going on. The [appellant, Chong and Ling] were still there.
 
 
 
...
In the course of the game they lost very heavy. They used rubber and told the [appellant] that they would pay him tomorrow.
But the appellant had testified: 
 
In October 1994, we gambled for about four to five hours. At the end of the gambling session, [Chong] owed me $10,000. [Ling] owed me $15,000. At first during the game, [Chong and Ling] told me that they would pay me at the end of the game but at the end of the game they told me they did not have funds and asked me to allow them to pay the next day.
 
 
 
There was thus a direct contradiction between Lim`s and the appellant`s evidence. In view of this, both testimonies were suspect, and, on this basis alone, the judge would have been entitled to reject their evidence.
As for the appellant himself, the judge found that his evidence was fabricated. The judge was led to this conclusion as he found it odd that Chong and Ling could pay up to the others but not the appellant; furthermore, the appellant hardly knew the debtors and got no acknowledgement or particulars from them; and the arrangements for repayment appeared all too uncertain. Of the three reasons identified, the latter two would appear to have some force. The appellant said that he considered the two debtors to be in a different category from most other debtors, but, notwithstanding that, it was still suspicious that all the arrangements were so scanty and uncertain. The appellant`s evidence was not convincing, and did not raise a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case.
However, as regards the finding that it was odd that Chong and Ling could pay off other players but not the appellant, there was not much weight that could be attached to this - the evidence was that the appellant wagered large amounts, and it was conceivable that the other players would not have wagered, and therefore won, similar large amounts. If so, it was possible that Chong and Ling would have been able to pay off the others. Lim had testified that the average bet was $500, with the least being about $100.
The conclusion was, therefore, that the judge was justified in coming to the conclusion that the evidence of Chong and Ling was to be preferred to that of the appellant, Tan and Lim.
Turning to the evidence of Goh and Khoo, these witnesses were adamant that they had been visited on two occasions each by the appellant, or at least a person who identified himself as `Ah Long`, which name was testified to have been used on at least one occasion by the appellant before both Goh and Khoo. The judge was entitled to prefer their evidence to that of the appellant.
 Whether the visit to Goh`s flat was harassment 
The appellant contended that the judge was wrong in finding that a visit at 11pm constituted harassment. The judge had noted: 
 
In any case the time of the visit, be it 11pm or 1am, clearly implied an intention to harass [Chong] and those living at her flat.
 
 
 
There is no definition of `harassment` in the Moneylender`s Act. Neither is there any judicial definition of the term. 
 The New Shorter Oxford 
 defines the verb `harass` as: 
 
Trouble by repeated attacks. Now freq, subject to constant molesting or persecution.
 
 
 
There is a necessary quality of repetition or persistency. The notion of harassment has to be contrasted with that of intimidation - the latter undoubtedly could include an isolated act; the juxtaposition implies therefore that the normal use of the term harassment has to be preserved. This interpretation is consistent with the decision of this court in 
PP v Tan Poh Heng
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 518
  , in which the appellant had visited the home of the debtor, and subsequently made a number of telephone calls. There was an attempt to persuade this court that a single visit could not amount to harassment. But it was found that that visit could not be isolated from a series of phone calls. It was stated at p 520: 
 
Both the visit and the telephone calls were part of a threatening course of conduct which had as its aim the demand for repayment of the debt due from the complainant`s husband and which caused alarm and distress to the complainant. In the circumstances I did not see how it could sensibly be said that there was doubt as to whether the respondent had `harassed` the complainant.
 
 
 
It must be noted that a single visit or encounter could undoubtedly amount to harassment if its intensity amounts to a persistent attack or persecution. Thus, if a loan shark were to make a single visit to a recalcitrant debtor, and remained at his door for several hours, that could amount to harassment. On the other hand, it is doubtful that a single visit of a short duration, albeit at a late hour, is sufficient to amount to harassment.
However, it could amount to an implied form of intimidation, which is the other act caught by s 33 of the Moneylenders Act. On the facts, in relation to Goh, the evidence is that there was use of vulgar language during the first visit to his flat, which would support the conclusion that there was some form of intimidation. Though the charge was one of harassment, an amendment to one of intimidation would not have caused any prejudice.
The second visit to Goh, on the other hand, did not disclose anything that would support a finding of either harassment or intimidation. It must be noted that the sixth charge against the appellant, which dealt with the second visit, stated that harassment was committed in that Goh was told to get Chong to pay up, otherwise Goh would have to settle the debt himself. This could fall within the ambit of acts of intimidation, but it would seem that that charge is not supported on the facts at all. Goh said in his examination-in-chief: 
 
On 8 February 1995 at about 1.30am, I was praying outside my unit. The [appellant] came up to my unit with another male Chinese. He identified himself as `Ah Long`. The [appellant] asked me about the whereabouts of my wife. My wife was sleeping in the flat. I was in the midst of praying and did not like being interrupted. I told the [appellant] that my wife was not at home. They told me to relay the message to my wife asking her to contact the [appellant] within three days. That was all he said. The [appellant] did not warn of any consequences if the money was not paid.
 
 
 
In fact, it was during the first visit that Goh was told to settle for his wife. Nothing in the evidence given by Goh would support the facts alleged in the charge.
An act of harassment could be made out if the second visit was taken together with the graffiti drawn at the landing, but no evidence was apparently adduced of the latter, save that Chong had come across it sometime in January 1995. In fact there was no evidence before the court that the graffiti on that occasion was caused by the appellant. Neither was it linked to him. The sixth charge was, therefore, not proven against the appellant.
As for the visits to Khoo, while neither of them constituted harassment, taken individually, they were sufficient acts of intimidation. The first visit to Khoo took place at 1am, with the appellant shouting loudly. A visit at such a time can only be taken generally to be calculated to intimidate the debtor or his family. Similarly, the cryptic remark of the appellant during the second visit, that if the debt was not repaid it would remain forever, would also in the circumstances have to be construed as calculated to intimidate as well. Again, no prejudice would have occurred if the charges were amended.
Following the recent Court of Appeal decision in 
Garmaz s/o Parkhar v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
  , it was open to this court to substitute under s 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code a conviction of intimidation for one of harassment. This was accordingly ordered to the 5th, 6th, 10th and 11th charges. The sixth charge, however, was not proven on the facts.
 Failure to call witnesses 
Counsel for the appellant raised a point that the prosecution did not call as witnesses other gamblers who were present to support their case that the appellant had visited Chong at least at the dens to get repayment of the various loans. He relied on s 116, illustration (g) of the Evidence Act which reads: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
Illustrations
 
 
 
The court may presume -
 
 
 
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.
 
 
 
The appellant`s contention was that the failure of the prosecution to adduce the evidence of those other gamblers meant that the court could presume that the evidence would have gone against the prosecution, that is that there were no such visits.
Such arguments are commonly made. Commonly too, such arguments are without merit. The court must hesitate to draw any such presumption unless the witness not produced is essential to the prosecution`s case. Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution. Where the witnesses not produced are not material, no presumption operates against the prosecution (
 Lahvinder Singh v State 
 [1988] Cri LJ 319). Neither would s 116 illustration (g) apply where the evidence to be given is largely redundant (
 Waisuddin v State 
[1991] Cri LJ 134). It was not shown that, in this appeal, the evidence of the witnesses not called was not immaterial or redundant.
It must be emphasized that s 116 illustration (g) is not mandatory. That provision merely states that the court may draw a presumption, not that it must. In determining whether or not that presumption ought to be drawn the court will have regard to all the circumstances, but particularly and importantly the materiality of the witnesses not produced. The adoption of any other approach would be to encourage the adducing of unnecessary evidence, prolonging the trial and confusing the issues.
The question that arises here is distinct from the question of whether the prosecution exercised its discretion correctly in not calling various witnesses for the prosecution. The latter was not raised in this appeal, but in view of the constant confusion between the two, it is necessary to deal with this point briefly. A number of English, Australian and Malaysian authorities have dealt with the duty of the prosecution to call witnesses. It has been thought that the failure to call witnesses may in some circumstances amount to a miscarriage of justice. This is a question of procedural fairness and justice. It has no evidentiary effect. The presumption under s 116 is evidentiary in nature - a set of facts is taken to be true upon the failure to produce a particular witness. Thus, while both the presumption and the prosecution`s duty are concerned with the same situation, the non-production of a witness, they are separate consequences. A miscarriage of justice may arise in a situation in which no presumption can be drawn; a presumption may be drawn in a situation that does not qualify as a miscarriage of justice.
The Court of Appeal in 
Lim Young Sien v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 257
  , in discussing s 116(g) had the opportunity to give its view on the duty of the prosecution. It was said at p 266: 
 
In our judgment, the law is well settled that, in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive, and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution, is offered to the defence.
 
 
 
The discretion conferred upon the prosecution cannot be fettered by any obligation to call a particular witness. What the prosecution has to do is to prove its case. It is not obliged to go out of its way to allow the defence any opportunity to test its evidence. It is not obliged to act for the defence. Only if there is an intention to hinder or hamper the defence would the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arise, requiring interference by the courts.
 Sentence 
Section 8(1)(b) has been reproduced above. The judge fined the appellant $12,000 on each of the loans made to Chong and between $15,000 and $20,000 on the loans made to Ling. The judge thought that it was necessary to strip the appellant of the gains from the moneylending. In 
 Ng Kum Peng 
, this court stated that it was necessary to protect persons from either threats of assault by illegal moneylenders or the very activity of moneylending. In that case, the trial judge had imposed the then maximum sentence of $5,000 on each of three charges of illegal loans of $3,000. That sentence was not varied on appeal. Taking those fines into account, and the increased limits, the fines imposed in the present case were not manifestly excessive.
As regards the fines imposed for harassment, $5,000 was imposed in each instance. In 
 PP v Tan Poh Heng 
 , the fine was raised from $8,000 to $12,000. In view of that, again the fines imposed were not manifestly excessive and therefore were upheld.
 Conclusion 
The convictions were correct on ten of the charges. Neither were the fines imposed manifestly excessive. The word `intimidate` was substituted for the word `harass` in DAC 4735/95, DAC 4736/95, DAC 4740/95 and DAC 4741/95. The appeal as to conviction and sentence on charges DAC 4731/95 to DAC 4735/95 and DAC 4736/95 to DAC 4741/95 was dismissed, while the appeal as to charge DAC 4736/95 was allowed, and the fine ordered to be returned to the appellant.

This was an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the deputy registrar granting an application by the second defendant under O 18 r 19(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court that the statement of claim be struck out and the action dismissed as against the second defendant with costs fixed at $6,000 (the order appealed against).
 The facts 
The first plaintiff was the wife of one Ayakanno Marithamuthu (Muthu). The second, third and fourth plaintiffs are the brothers of the first plaintiff. The fifth plaintiff is the mother and the sixth plaintiff, the sister, respectively of the first plaintiff.
On 18 December 1984, the first plaintiff made a report at the Joo Chiat Police Station stating that Muthu who allegedly had left a week ago after telling her that he was going to Genting Highlands had been missing since.
On 27 March 1987, the first, second, third and fourth plaintiffs were charged with the murder of Muthu at the caretaker`s quarters of the Orchard Road Presbyterian Church, Singapore, at about 10pm on 12 December 1984.
On 28 March 1987, the fifth and sixth plaintiffs were charged with abetment in the murder of Muthu.
On 6 June 1987, the plaintiffs were granted a discharge not amounting to acquittal. Upon their discharge, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs were re-arrested and detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67).
In March 1991, the second, third and fourth plaintiffs filed habeas corpus proceedings to challenge the legality of their detention. Pending the hearing of their application, they were released on 21 June 1991. Following their release, they discontinued their habeas corpus proceedings.
On 23 August 1993, the first plaintiff pursuant to leave of court affirmed in an affidavit that Muthu had been missing since 10 December 1984 and had not been heard of since and, accordingly, she believed him to be dead.
The police investigation, the criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs, their subsequent discharge, the detention of the second to the fourth plaintiffs and their habeas corpus proceedings were reported in 
 The Straits Times 
, a daily newspaper published by the first defendant. These publications were:
 
 
(i) 27 March 1987 - a front page report under the heading `Curry Murder Horror` stated that Muthu reported missing by his wife `was said to have been brought to the church premises on the afternoon of 12 December, a Friday, by three men whom he had been out with earlier in the day. That night he was hit on the head with an iron rod in the kitchen of the quarters, chopped up and cooked in a large aluminium cooking pot similar to the type used by Indian restaurants for 
 nasi 
 
 briyani 
.` 
 
(ii) 27 March 1987 - a write-up at p 11 under the heading `
 Diary of a bizarre killing 
` gave a summary of the police investigation that led to the arrest of the plaintiffs. 
 
(iii) 28 March 1987 - a report under the heading `Woman and three brothers [referring to the first to fourth plaintiffs] charged with murder` stated: `They allegedly killed her husband in church grounds.` 
 
(iv) 29 March 1987 - there was a report under the heading `Two [referring to the fifth and sixth plaintiffs] charged with abetting in caretaker`s murder.` 
 
(v) 4 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading 
 `Caretaker`s murder. 
Judge on lawyer`s right to see client`. 
 
(vi) 5 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `
 Caretaker`s murder 
. Women charged with abetting murder remanded again.`. 
 
(vii) 11 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `
 Caretaker murder. 
Accused [referring to the first to fourth plaintiffs] remanded another week.` 
 
(viii) 12 April 1987 - there was a report under the heading `Medical care for accused` that the fifth and sixth plaintiffs were remanded for another week. 
 
(ix) 7 June 1987 - there was a report with the heading `Judge frees six charged in curry murder case. Release for lack of proof but they don`t get full acquittal.` In the same issue appeared a write-up under the heading `five months of digging into caretaker`s murder.` It gave a chronology of the investigation, arrest of and the preferring of charges against the plaintiffs. 
 
(x) 10 March 1991 - there was a report under the heading 
 ` 
""Curry murder case"" brothers challenge detention`. Itreported the habeas corpus action taken by the second, third and fourth plaintiffs. 
 
(xi) 22 June 1991 - there was a report on the release of the second, third and fourth plaintiffs under the heading `Three held since 1987 freed. Unconditional release for brothers detained for allegedly killing brother-in-law.` 
 
(xii) 21 July 1991 - there was a report under the heading `Three drop action against government for wrongful detention`.
  
 
 
On 6 May 1995, there appeared in 
 The Straits Times 
 issue an article in the Leisure page on a serial of five crime stories under the heading `Curry murder case to be in new TCS serial`
 . 
The relevant parts of the article (the passage complained of) read: 
 
The sensational curry murder case, which took place in 1984, will soon be dramatized in the second season of a Mandarin serial by the Television Corporation of Singapore. ...
 
 
 
The case, involving the murder of an Indian man and the cooking of his dismembered body parts in curry (see box) will take up the first five episodes of the show. ...
Mr Tsang Ho Man, executive producer of the serial warned that, although all five stories in the new show are based on true cases, viewers should not expect something like 
 Crime Watch 
, which consists of actual re-enactments of past criminal cases.
`We still have to make sure that the true stories are garnished for dramatic effect,` he said.
The `box` referred to in the passage complained of contained a summary of events (the box). Under the heading `The Curry Murder` it read: 
 
The bizarre curry murder took place on 12 December 1984, at the church quarters of Orchard Road Presbyterian Church.
 
 
 
The victim was Mr Ayakanno Marithamuthu, then 37 and a father of three. He was reported missing in December 1984 by his wife, who informed the police that he had told her he was going to the Genting Highlands in Malaysia.
The victim, who was described as a wife-beater, was then a live-in caretaker of the Public Utilities Board holiday chalets in Changi.
Investigations into the murder showed that he was hit on the head with an iron rod in the kitchen of the quarters and chopped up and cooked in a large aluminium cooking pot.
His wife and her three brothers were charged in 1987 with murder. They were later released in the same year because of the lack of proof.
The three brothers were then re-arrested on the same day and detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.
But they were released unconditionally in June 1991 after spending four years in Changi Prison.
On 12 May 1995, the plaintiffs demanded of the defendants an apology for the allegedly defamatory remarks in the passage complained of. The demand was rejected by the defendants.
 The proceedings 
The plaintiffs then commenced proceedings against the defendants seeking damages for libel arising from the passage complained of read with the box and reports and write-ups enumerated herein. On being served with the writ endorsed with the statement of claim, the second defendant applied for and obtained the order appealed against. The plaintiffs appealed. The appeal came before me. I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
Order 18 r 19(1)(a) reads: 
 
(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that -
 
 
 
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
 
 
 
On the exercise by the court of its powers to strike out a statement of claim or defence under O 18 r 19, LP Thean J (as he then was) in 
 Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 505
  at p 507 stated: 
 
Striking out the whole of a defence to a claim for libel is an extraordinary step and is only allowed in a plain and obvious case. In 
 Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association & Ors
, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for libel in respect of an article published in the 
 British Medical Journal
. The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim. The application was dismissed by the master and, on appeal, by Milmo J. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed it. Lord Pearson after referring to O 18 r 19 of the English Rules of Supreme Court said, at pp 695-696:
 
 
 
`Over a long period of years it has been firmly established by many authorities that the powers to strike out a statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action is a summary power which should be exercised only in plain and obvious cases. The authorities are collected in 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1970,
 under the heading `Exercise of powers under this rule` in the notes under RSC O 18 r 19 p 284. One which might be added is 
 Nagle v Feilden
[1966] 2 QB 633
, 648, 651. Reference has been made to four recent cases: 
 Rondel v Worsley
[1969] 1 AC 191
; 
 Wiseman v Borneman
 
[1969] 3 WLR 706
; 
 Roy v Prior
 
[1970] 1 QB 283
; and 
 Schmidt v Home Office
[1969] 2 Ch 149. In each of these cases there was an important question of principle involved, and the hearing of the application under RSC O 18 r 19 was much longer and more elaborate than is usual, but the final decision was that the alleged cause of action was clearly unsustainable, and so the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was ordered to be struck out. There was no departure from the principle that the order for striking out should only be made if it becomes plain and obvious that the claim or defence cannot succeed, but the procedural method was unusual in that there was a relatively long and elaborate instead of a short and summary hearing.
 
 
 
... But, in the words of Sir Gordon Willmer in 
 Drummond-Jackson 
 at p 700, the question whether a point is plain and obvious does not depend upon the length of time it takes to argue. Rather the question is whether, when the point has been argued, it has become plain and obvious that there can be but one result.`
By para 12 of the statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that the passage complained of and the box enlarged by the news reports and write-ups referred to herein: 
 
[I]n their natural and ordinary meaning and/or by way of innuendo bore the following meanings defamatory of the plaintiffs:
 
 
 
(i) that the deceased was murdered on 12 December 1984;
 
 
 
 
(ii) that by virtue of the above, the first plaintiff made a false police report on or around December 1984 stating, inter alia, that the deceased had been missing for more than one week; 
 
(iii) that by virtue of the above, the first plaintiff made a false affidavit on 23 August 1993 to state, inter alia, that the deceased had been missing since 10 December 1984; 
 
(iv) that the deceased was murdered in the caretaker`s quarters of the Orchard Road Presbyterian Church which happened to be the home of the fourth and fifth plaintiffs; 
 
(v) that the deceased was murdered in a certain manner pursuant to the findings of the Special Investigation Section of the CID as first reported in an edition of the first defendants` newspaper dated 27 March 1987; 
 
(vi) that the deceased was murdered in a certain manner as could only have been executed by the plaintiffs; 
 
(vii) that although the plaintiffs were charged for committing and abetting to commit the murder of the deceased sometime in March 1987 and subsequently released for lack of proof, it has nevertheless been conclusively proved that the deceased was murdered by the plaintiffs; 
 
(viii) that although it has been proved that the deceased was murdered by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs cannot be prosecuted for the same because of certain legal technicalities.
  
 
 
The natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the passage complained of in the context in which they are set out is to be determined by the court according to what the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and commonsense. See 
 Bank of China v Asiaweek 
 supra at p 508 where LP Thean J stated: 
 
... The natural and ordinary meanings of the words, in the context they are set out, is to be determined by the court. In 
 Slim & Ors v Daily Telegraph Ltd & Ors
 at pp 174-175, Diplock LJ said:
 
 
 
`... where an action for libel is tried by a judge alone without a jury, it is he who has to arrive at a single ""right"" meaning as ""the natural and ordinary meaning"" of the words complained of ...`
 
 
 
He repeated this at p 176: `But where a judge is sitting alone to try a libel action without a jury, the only questions he has to ask himself are: ""Is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that which is alleged in the statement of claim?"" And: ""If not, what, if any, less injurious defamatory meaning do they bear?""
 
 
 
And at p 177 he said: 
 
`What then is this court to do? I do not think we need send it back for a retrial. No oral evidence given at the trial throws any light upon the natural and ordinary meaning of the words to readers of the correspondence columns in the 
 Daily Telegraph
. This court is in as good a position as the judge to determine what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and in so far as any action for libel can be a simple case, I think that this one is.`
 
 
 
In this case, I was in as good a position, on the hearing of the appeal, as a judge trying the action to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words.
 
 
 
What then is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of? The question is one purely of construction of the words, and the approach to be adopted in construing these words is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons: para 4.04 of 
 Duncan and Neil on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed). Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Jones v Skelton 
 said at p 958: 
 
`The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or any indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words (see 
 Lewis v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 [1963] 2 All ER 151). The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader, guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words. The test of reasonableness guides and directs the court in its function of deciding whether it is open to a jury in any particular case to hold that reasonable persons would understand the words complained of in a defamatory sense.`
 
 
 
The passage complained of does not refer to any of the plaintiffs. Neither do the words suggest in their natural and ordinary meaning that any of the plaintiffs was guilty of the murder of Muthu or that the first plaintiff made a false affidavit relating to the disappearance of Muthu as contended in para 12 of the statement of claim.
In the alternative, the plaintiffs claimed that by way of innuendo the passage complained of read in the context of the box and the news reports and write-ups in 
 The Straits Times 
 , bore the said defamatory meanings referred to in para 12 of the statement of claim.
In 
 Astaire v Campling & Anor 
 [1996] 1 WLR 34, the facts there according to the head-notes are that the plaintiff, a man well known in boxing circles and the holder of a manager`s licence, issued a writ for libel against the writer and publishers of an article which appeared in a Sunday newspaper on 3 November 1963. The article was critical of the plaintiff`s activities in the boxing world and identified him as `Mr X - a man well known in the fight game.` For some weeks prior to the publication of the article complained of extensive adverse publicity had been given to the activities of `Mr X` in a broadcast and in numerous articles in other newspapers with which the defendants had no connection. Paragraph 3 of the plaintiff`s statement of claim set out the whole of the alleged libel. Paragraph 4 alleged eight innuendoes. Paragraph 5 set out, as facts and matters relied on in support of the innuendoes, extracts from the broadcast and from 13 other articles relating to `Mr X` which had appeared in the other newspapers. The defendants applied under RSC O 18 r 19 to strike out paras 4 and 5 of the statement of claim on the ground that the facts and matters contained in para 5 were incapable of supporting the innuendoes and that therefore para 4 contained no cause of action. The Court of Appeal held that it was not permissible to impute a defamatory meaning to words which might be innocent in their natural and ordinary meaning by reason of and by reference to other allegedly defamatory statements made by other persons on other occasions, which had not been expressly adopted or repeated by the publishers of the statement in respect of which the action was brought. To give rise to a cause of action against such a publisher, the statement of fact or expression of opinion relied on as defamatory must be one which could reasonably be said to be contained, whether expressly or by implication, in the statement in respect of which the action was brought.
In delivering his judgment, Sellers LJ said at pp 38-39: 
 
Contrary to the plaintiff`s contention, the innuendoes in para 4, in my view, are not and cannot be derived from the article complained of in para 3 (which is the alleged libel) when read in the light of the extrinsic facts set out in the long para 5, but arise, if at all, in the material set out in that paragraph, sub-paras 3 to 18, for which the defendants are not responsible. A reasonable reader would not and could not attribute them or their implications to the defendants.
 
 
 
It may well be, that in circumstances where the identity of a plaintiff is not expressly referred to in an article, extrinsic evidence may be given to establish identity, but it seems to me a wholly different matter to seek to add to the alleged libel defamatory views expressed and published by somebody else. Counsel for the plaintiff relied on the decision as to identity and some of the observations in an American case in the last century, 
 Van Ingen v Mail & Express Publishing Co 
, and in his argument, and particularly in his final argument in reply, he laid stress on the following words to be found in the opinion given by Martin J, which was the majority opinion of the court. The judge said: 
 
`To determine the effect of the defendant`s article and to whom it applied, it would seem proper to show the condition of the public mind, the information the public possessed upon the subject of the article, and the consequent inference which it would readily draw from reading it.`
 
 
 
And in another passage:
 
 
 
`In other words, it seems to me that a defendant cannot publish a libel of another and shield himself by not disclosing the name of the person to whom it was intended to refer, when he knows and understands that by reason of former publications the public mind is in a condition where it would necessarily understand the article as applying to him alone.`
 
 
 
The public mind may no doubt be relevant in a case of identity, but if it has been affected by defamatory statements made by someone other than the defendant and not by the defendant, the article does not seem to me to make the defendant liable for anything more than it contains. It must be brought home by the evidence of innuendo to a reader that the article itself, which is the article complained of as the libel, has in the light of all the circumstances a defamatory meaning. In my view the facts set out in support of the innuendo do no such thing and I would dismiss this appeal.
 
 
 
The second defendant was not responsible for the publication of the news reports, write-ups and the box on `The Curry Murder` case and neither had it adopted or repeated them. Therefore no defamatory meaning should be imputed to the passage complained of by reason of and by reference to these other allegedly defamatory statements.
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed with costs.

s 268 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The petitioner under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) sought criminal revision of a decision of a district judge accepting a supposed plea of guilt by the petitioner and sentencing him to nine months` imprisonment. The revision was granted, the sentence set aside and the case was remitted for a new trial before another district judge. Since the appellant was in prison all this while, and no bail was granted, it was also ordered that an early date be set for the new trial.
 Brief facts 
The petitioner was charged with the commission of an outrage of modesty punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He appeared before the district judge on 29 January 1996. The petitioner was unrepresented then. The notes taken by the district judge were brief and are reproduced in full: 
 
Prosecutor: One charge against accused. May plea be taken.
 
 
 
Charge read explained and understood in Tamil. Pleads guilty. Understands nature and consequences of the plea. Statement of facts read (`A`).
 
 
 
Accused admits to statement of facts. Nothing known. Mitigation: Done unintentionally. Very crowded and he was pushed forward and unintentionally he touched her. 
 
Court: Why admit to the statement of facts?
 
 
 
 
Accused: I came here to work. If I did not admit it I would not have any ways of proving I did not do it. Did not want to go through the trouble.
  
 
 
 
Prosecutor: May matter be stood down so I can explain matter to him. 
 
Court: Stand down to 10.05am.
  
 
 
10.05am court resumed
Accused: Wishes to withdraw the last mitigation. Further mitigation: Remanded since 2 January 1996. Spent a lot of money in India to work here. Worked here the past three years. Family facing financial difficulties. Please impose lenient sentence and to backdate sentence. 
Prosecutor: No submission on sentencing. Confirm remanded since 2 January 1996. 
Court: Nine months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Imprisonment with effect from 2 January 1996.
 
 
 
 
 
 The petition 
 
 
 
In his petition for revision, the petitioner disclosed that no appeal was filed as he was ignorant of the procedures. That being so, he sought to challenge the decision of the trial court as being flawed. The flaws he identified were that he was unrepresented, that the trial court failed to examine him carefully, that the explanation of the effect of his first mitigation ought not to have been done by the prosecutor, that the petitioner was under duress to plead guilty, that the plea was thus made out of desperation, and finally that the petitioner was innocent and desired an opportunity to defend himself.
In his arguments before this court, counsel for the petitioner noted a number of points concerning the decision and judgment of the district judge. First, it was pointed out that the district judge failed to record any conviction before sentencing, contrary to s 180(b) CPC, which is mandatory. It was also contended that the trial court failed to ensure that the petitioner understood the nature and consequence of his plea of guilt, and whether the petitioner in fact intended to admit without qualification the charge against him. That it was the prosecutor who explained the effect of his first mitigation was irregular, and this ought to have been done by the court. Indeed, the petitioner`s first mitigation could not be regarded as an unequivocal plea of guilt, which meant that a plea of not guilty ought to have been recorded. Finally, it was also said that the court failed to explain to the petitioner that he could defend himself if he wished to plead his innocence.
 The respondent`s case 
The respondent`s case was directed to the grounds of petition. It was contended by the respondent that the fact that the petitioner was unrepresented did not impugn the proceedings. The court had also allowed the petitioner the opportunity to reassess his earlier plea, and neither was the petitioner denied a fair hearing. The act of the prosecuting officer in explaining the consequences of the petitioner`s mitigation was one done as part of her role as an officer of the court. No grievances were voiced by the petitioner then against the prosecuting officer. As for the petitioner`s allegation that the prosecutor had coerced the petitioner into pleading guilt, the respondent contended that this amounted to the adducing of fresh evidence, which required a motion to the court. It was finally said that the petitioner ought not be granted the revision as there had been a long delay.
Before this court, the respondent added that the failure to record a conviction was a mere irregularity which could be cured under s 396, CPC.
 The issues 
The crucial points which arose for determination were:
 
 
(1) Whether the failure to record the conviction was fatal. 
 
(2) The effect of the initial mitigation.
  
 
 
1 Failure to record the conviction
The primary issue in this revision was whether the failure to record a conviction as required by s 180(n)(ii), CPC - and not s 180(b) - was a fatal irregularity which could not be cured by s 396 CPC.
Section 180 reads, in its relevant portions: 
 
The following procedure shall be observed by Magistrate`s Courts and District Courts in summary trials:
 
 
 
...
(b) if the accused pleads guilty to a charge whether as originally framed or as amended, the plea shall be recorded and he may be convicted on it:
 
 
 
 
Provided that before a plea of guilty is recorded the court shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him; 
 
... 
 
(n) (ii) if the court finds the accused guilty or a plea of guilty is recorded against him, it shall record a conviction and pass sentence according to law either forthwith or on such day as the court may appoint;
  
 
 
While s 396 reads: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
(a) any error omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;
 
 
 
 
(b) the want of any sanction required by section 129; or 
 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence,
  
 
 
unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
The petitioner argued that s 396 had no application in this case for it had to be read subject to the mandatory nature of s 180. The prosecution on the other hand contended that s 396 was only to be read subject to the provision preceding it in its chapter of the CPC, namely, s 395, which reads: 
 
(1) No finding or sentence pronounced or passed shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed unless in the opinion of the appellate court a failure of justice has been occasioned thereby.
 
 
 
 
(2) If the appellate court thinks that a failure of justice has been occasioned by an omission to frame a charge it shall order a new trial shall be held.
  
 
 
The difficulty with the prosecution`s approach was that it seemed redundant to make s 396 subject to s 395. Since s 396 is a curative provision, which removes the taint of any irregularity, the plain reading of a saving clause would be that s 396 would not apply as regards specific sections, failure to abide by which would not be curable. Section 395 on the other hand is also curative, and it makes no sense to have a saving clause for such a provision.
Guidance on the subject may be derived from Indian authorities. Section 465(1) of the Indian Code is in the same terms. The interpretation of the phrase `subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained` has not been consistent. In 
 Raj Chander Mazumdar v G Chander Mazumdar 
(1895)ILR 22 Cal 176 and 
 Jogesh Chandra Bhattacharjee 
(1896)ILR 23 Cal 983, the view taken was that this refers only to the immediately preceding sections of the same chapter.
But while the majority of the court in 
 Ram Subhag Singh v Emperor 
(1915) 16 Cri LJ 641 held that s 396 was only subject to the preceding provisions of the same chapter, the minority thought that it was subject to the whole of the preceding code. Subsequently in 
 Bhajja v Emperor 
 All 238, Allsop J took an intermediate line, holding that the equivalent of s 396 had to be read subject to the preceding provisions of the chapter, unless there was a specific provision in any other part of the Code which specified that an error will vitiate proceedings despite there being no failure of justice.
The issue is thus far free from authority locally. It must be noted though that reading the Indian equivalent of s 396 as subject only to preceding provisions in the same chapter makes some sense in India when it is noted that in the Indian Code there are a number of provisions preceding s 465 in the same chapter dealing with various irregularities, some of which, as listed in the present s 461, render the decision of the magistrate void. Similarly in the Straits Settlements Code of 1910, there were two other provisions in the same chapter as the equivalents of s 396 and s 395, dealing with proceedings being held in the wrong place, and the irregular taking of confessions. However, there was in 1910 and afterwards no provision in that chapter which vitiated proceedings totally without any test of material injustice. The restricted reading is even less tenable at present when the only other preceding provision in the chapter is s 395. Thus, whatever the original intention may have been, the only way the phrase `subject to provisions hereinbefore contained` can make sense is if it were read subject to all preceding provisions in the code.
But this cannot mean that the operation of s 396 is excluded by provisions which are cast in mandatory terms. Most provisions in the code governing procedure in the courts are couched using the word `shall`. If all such provisions have to be regarded as outside the ambit of s 396 then breach of most provisions of the code would be fatal, regardless of the gravity or seriousness of the breach. This is unreasonable. Taking s 180 as an example, it may be noted that though the section as a whole is expressed in mandatory terms, the various aspects of the trial covered by it vary in their importance and the impact of infringement upon an accused person. For example, the failure to allow the accused to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution goes to the heart of the adversarial process, and breach of that would probably have to be regarded as an illegality. On the other hand, for example, the failure to record a plea of guilt would not go as far, and the effect of such failure would have to be weighed. In the view of this court, where no injustice is caused to the accused, such an error is amenable to being cured under s 396. There is nothing in s 396 itself which would restrict its application only to those provisions which are merely directory or confer a discretion upon the court.
Support for the approach adopted is derived from a number of Indian cases. The Appeals Board of the Privy Council has in a number of cases (
 Subramania Iyer v King-Emperor 
 (1915)28 IA 257, 
 Babulal Choukhani v Emperor 
 PC 30, 
 Pulukuri Kotayya v Emperor 
 PC 67) drawn a distinction between illegalities and irregularities. Though this is not reflected in the code, the distinction, which is one of degree, draws a line between those errors that go to the mode of the trial, which would be illegalities, and those which affect merely the conduct of it, which would be irregularities. Furthermore, where a mandatory provision of the code has not been adhered to, it is doubtful that that would be fatal to the trial even if no prejudice has been caused to the accused (
 Alimahomed v Kasturchand 
 (1938) 41 Bom LR 90). This is supported by 
 Pulukuri Kotayya 
 where the prosecution failed, as required by s 162 of the Indian Code, to supply the defence with statements. Section 162 was acknowledged by the Privy Council to be an important provision, but, in the view of the Board, a distinction had to be drawn between the manner or mode of trial and the conduct of it. Breach of the latter is curable by the equivalent of s 396. Sir John Beaumont, delivering the judgment of the Board, said, at p 75: 
 
When a trial is conducted in a manner different from that prescribed by the Code (as in 
 NA Subramania Iyer`s
case) the trial is bad, and no question of curing an irregularity arises; but if the trial is conducted substantially in the manner prescribed by the Code, but some irregularity occurs in the course of such conduct, the irregularity can be cured under s 537 [the equivalent of s 396], and none the less so because the irregularity involves, as must nearly always be the case, a breach of one or more of the very comprehensive provisions of the Code. The distinction drawn in many of the cases in India between an illegality and an irregularity is one of degree rather than of kind.
 
 
 
In the Federated Malay States, the Court of Appeal had to consider whether the failure to record a conviction of a person amounted to an irregularity which could be cured by s 422, the equivalent of s 396. The case of 
 S Govindasamy v PP 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 101
  involved an accused who had been convicted by the High Court, consisting of a judge sitting with assessors. The code required the judge to give judgment where he agreed with the assessors. The record failed to show that the judge gave any judgment. That record only stated as follows: 
 
Assessors without retiring both find accused guilty of murder.
 
 
 
It was thus not stated in the record that the judge agreed with the assessors, or that he convicted the accused. It was found by the Court of Appeal that this was not a mere irregularity, and could not be cured by the equivalent of s 396.
Subsequently the same court, with two of the judges who heard 
 Govindasamy 
 , heard the appeal of 
 Wong Heng v PP 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 127
 . In this case, the accused was again found guilty by assessors; the judge in this case recorded his agreement with them, but failed, as required by s 198(1) of the Federation Code, to record the conviction. Only the sentence was noted. 
 Govindasamy 
 distinguished by the Court of Appeal as involving a more serious omission, that of recording the judge`s agreement with both assessors. Unlike the earlier case, the Court of Appeal in 
 Wong Heng 
that there was no doubt that the judge had brought his mind to bear on the innocence of the accused. The court noted that the failure to record a conviction contravened s 198(i) which reads: 
 
If the Court agrees with the opinion of both assessors, or where the assessors are of different opinions with the opinion of one assessor the Court shall give judgment accordingly.
 
 
 
But in the view of the court, citing 
 Pulukuri Kotayya 
, a failure to observe s 198 could be cured by s 422. It must be noted that the court did so despite the mandatory wording of s 198.
Thus a failure to record the conviction as required by s 180(n)(ii) is an irregularity which can be cured under s 396. In the circumstances of this petition, no injustice was caused by the failure to record the conviction. The petitioner then was left only with the arguments based on whether his plea of guilt had been withdrawn.
2 Modification of the mitigation plea
While the petitioner did plead guilty, he said in his mitigation that the act of molest was done unintentionally. In the circumstances this was a disowning of both intention and knowledge.
Section 354 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any two of such punishments.
 
 
 
Sections 350 and 351 Penal Code which deal with criminal force and assault, similarly require either intention or knowledge.
The material facts to be admitted were that: 
 
When the accused [the petitioner] walked passed [sic] the victim, he used his hand and pressed her crotch.
 
 
 
It was apparent then that the mitigation plea was a denial of the admitted facts, and that the petitioner committed any wrong. Notwithstanding his earlier admission of the facts, there was then some doubt that the petitioner understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that he had intended to admit the offence without qualification.
The issue then was whether that denial ought to have been accepted without more by the district judge. The petitioner cited the case of 
 Koh Mui Keow v R 
 
 
 
[1952] MLJ 214
  for the proposition that the court had to be satisfied that the petitioner was indeed pleading guilty on his own accord. On the facts, the district judge did not contravene that principle for he had attempted to satisfy himself that the petitioner was indeed pleading guilty, asking the petitioner why he admitted to the prosecution facts if he claimed the act was accidental. This court would be reluctant to go so far as to require that a magistrate or district judge treat, without further investigation, every mitigation plea which discloses the possibility of a denial of the admitted facts as constituting a modification of a plea of guilt.
However, what happened next was that it was the prosecutor who made a request in the following words: 
 
May the matter be stood down so I can explain matter to him.
 
 
 
The petitioner then withdrew his mitigation and submitted another basis for leniency.
The petitioner contended that it was not for the prosecutor to take it upon herself to explain the matter to him. This court agreed with that. While the prosecutor is undoubtedly an officer of the court, and has a role to play in assisting the court in its deliberations, it is for the court below to be satisfied that the plea of guilt is made unequivocally. Even though this is not expressly provided for in the CPC, it arises from the stipulation in s 180(b) that the court has to be satisfied that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea. On the facts of this petition, the court below could not be said to have been properly satisfied that the accused understood the nature and consequences of his plea. And the failure to do so was not curable by s 396, for it caused an injustice since the petitioner was unrepresented. The adversarial nature of criminal proceedings was a further reason why it was not appropriate for the explanation, whatever that may have meant, to have been made by the prosecutor.
It was clear to this court that there was no evidence of any misconduct by the prosecutor, who apparently was indeed trying her best to assist the court below. Be that as it may, there was no sufficient satisfaction by the court below that the plea of guilt was not unequivocal. The irregularity in the proceedings being extant and incurable, the withdrawal of the initial mitigation and the subsequent alternative mitigation was of no effect.
 Revision and orders 
In the circumstances, the conviction of the petitioner was a palpable injustice which warranted the granting of revision. Contrary to the contention of the prosecution, there was no significant or material delay by the petitioner in taking out these proceedings.
The petitioner had sought quashing of the conviction, but this court was not minded to do so for, as the record stood, there was in fact no conviction. However, the sentence was set aside, and pursuant to s 268 the case was remitted for an early retrial in another court below.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor against an order of the district judge confiscating a sum under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A) (DTA).
 Brief facts
The respondent pleaded guilty to and was convicted of two charges of trafficking in a controlled drug contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (MDA) and one charge of consumption contrary to s 8(b) MDA. Following his conviction, the prosecution made an application under s 4 of the DTA for the confiscation of benefits derived by him from drug trafficking. The respondent did not oppose this.
In support of the application, a financial statement prepared by an officer of the Financial Investigation Division of the Central Narcotics Bureau was tendered by the prosecution pursuant to s 6, DTA, and was accepted by the respondent. The calculations were as follows. First, the net worth of the respondent on 10 February 1996, the date of his arrest, was ascertained to be $32,719.08. In contrast, his net worth on 1 October 1995, when he first started trafficking, was only $13,455.49. Thus the change in net worth was $19,263.59. Various sums spent by the respondent, including the downpayment, rent, and cooking utensils for a coffeeshop food stall run by his niece, were discovered to total some $29,736. The wealth accumulated by the respondent was thus the sum of his expenditure together with his change in net worth, and came to $48,999.59. His known sources of income throughout that period only totalled about $5,081.49. The difference between his accumulated wealth and his known income came to $43,918.10. The prosecution contended that this amount represented the benefits derived by the respondent from drug trafficking. It was further found that the realisable assets in the hands of the respondent came to about $31,944.11.
Below, the prosecution argued that, because there was a shortfall in the amount realisable compared to the amount derived from drug trafficking, there was a default in payment of the amount to be confiscated, requiring a further term of imprisonment to be imposed under the DTA.
 The decision
The district judge held the confiscation order would have to be in terms of the realisable amount and that was only $31,944.11. In his view, the object of the Act is not to punish convicted persons who for valid reasons do not have assets equal in value to the benefits derived by them from drug trafficking. Section 7(3) DTA recognises that an accused may have a shortfall in the value of the assets which would not be available for confiscation. The judge relied on an English case, 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 562, which interpreted provisions of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (UK) in pari materia with s 7 of the DTA.
 The appeal
The prosecution appeals, arguing in court that the confiscation order is not necessarily limited to the value of the actual assets known to be in the possession of the defendant in an application. It was pointed out that the definitions of `realisable property` and `the amount that might be realised` in the Act included gifts to third parties. 
 R v Horst Reiner Ilsemann 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 398, 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) and 
 R v Carroll 
 [1991] Crim LR 720 were cited. The only relevant local decision, 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
(OS 1064/94) (unreported) was also referred to by the prosecution. The prosecution further contended that what is confiscateable is not property derived from drug trafficking, but the value of the benefits however they might be represented: 
 David Dickens 
 (1990) 91 Cr App R 164 cited. Applying that proposition, the prosecution contended that the gift of money made to the respondent`s niece of about $24,000, which was used to set up the food stall, should be caught as well. It is said that the trial judge erred because he had limited the amount to be confiscated to the amount actually held by the respondent, and that he had placed the burden of proof wrongly: 
 Ilsemann 
, 
 Comiskey 
, 
 Carroll 
, and 
 R v Johnson 
 
[1991] 2 QB 249
 cited.
The respondent maintains that the district judge was correct in his decision. The submitted arguments of his counsel were directed, through no fault of theirs, to the contentions made by the prosecution below. It was said that all the assets that could have been seized had been seized. In the alternative, the court was informed that the respondent`s family would be willing to pay up any difference, should the decision go against the respondent.
 The issues
The DTA has not as yet received full consideration by the courts save for the decision of Kan Ting Chiu J in 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
. It is necessary then for this court to lay down, as guidance for the subordinate courts, the procedure to be used in determining confiscation of benefits, and the principles to be weighed in deciding whether any and what amount should in fact be confiscated. Following that, the correctness of the decision of the trial judge will be examined.
 The procedure
The starting point for confiscation is s 4(1), which reads: 
 
... where a defendant is convicted of one or more drug trafficking offences, the court shall, on the application of the Public Prosecutor, make a confiscation order against the defendant in respect of benefits derived by him from drug trafficking if the court is satisfied that such benefits have been so derived.
 
 
 
The court is thus obliged to exercise the power to confiscate the benefits derived from drug trafficking upon an application by the Public Prosecutor, but this is subject to the condition precedent that the defendant has in fact obtained benefits from drug trafficking. In determining whether the defendant has in fact obtained any benefits, the court applies a presumption, under s 4(4), that a person who holds any property or any interest therein which is disproportionate to his known sources of income which cannot be explained, has derived benefits from drug trafficking. If the court is satisfied that benefits have been derived from drug trafficking, it shall determine the amount to be confiscated: s 4(2). Such an order for confiscation should be made before the defendant is actually sentenced.
The benefits derived from drug trafficking are assessed by the court in accordance with s 5(1): 
 
... for the purposes of this Act -
 
 
 
 
(a) the benefits derived by any person from drug trafficking shall be any property or interest therein held by the person at any time, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, being property or interest disproportionate to his known sources of income and the holding of which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the court; and 
 
(b) the value of the benefits derived by him from drug trafficking shall be the aggregate of the values of the properties and interests therein referred to in paragraph (a).
  
 
 
Section 5(1) operates as a presumption - it is for the defendant to show that his property was derived from innocent sources. The quantification of the concealed income may be made by taking the sum of the assets of the defendant together with his expenditure less the sum of his liabilities and legitimate income.
In this appeal, the prosecution put forward that the benefits derived from drug trafficking totalled some $43,918.10. This was correctly obtained by determining what was termed the respondent`s concealed income, which was property or interest therein which was disproportionate to the known sources of the respondent`s income, and which they contend he could not explain satisfactorily.
In assessing such benefits, the court may have the assistance of statements tendered by the prosecution under s 6(1). If the defendant accepts such a statement or any part of that statement, the court is entitled to treat the statement as conclusive. The court is also entitled to require the defendant to indicate any disagreement that he may have, and what he will rely upon to support such disagreement.
The court having assessed the benefits derived would then be in a position to determine the amount to be confiscated under s 7. Section 7(1) reads: 
 
Subject to subsection (3), the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
It is possible that an amount different from the benefits derived will be recovered, for s 7(1) is expressed to be subject to s 7(3), which reads: 
 
If the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than the amount the court assesses to be the value of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking, the amount to be recovered from the defendant under the confiscation order shall be the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised.
 
 
 
In determining what the realisable amount is, the court will have to consider the value of the realisable property. Section 8(2) reads: 
 
For the purposes of sections 6 and 7, the amount that might be realised at the time a confiscation order is made against the defendant shall be -
 
 
 
 
(a) the total of the values at that time of all the realisable property held by the defendant; less 
 
(b) where there are obligations having priority at that time, the total amounts payable in pursuance of such obligations,
  
 
 
together with the total of the values at that time of all gifts caught by this Act.
 
 
 
Realisable property is defined by s 8(1), as covering both property held by the defendant as well as gifts made by him. It is significant that s 8(2) speaks of the value of the realisable property rather than the realisable property - this indicates that the realisation need not operate on a particular piece of property (
 R v David Dickens 
 (1990) 91 Cr App R 164, 172). Under s 6(4) the defendant may tender a statement indicating the amount that may be realised, and the prosecution may accept such a statement from the defence. The burden lies upon the defence to show what the realisable amount is. Section 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) provides that: 
 
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.
 
 
 
Here, it is the defendant who would desire the court to believe that the realisable amount is some other amount other than the value of the benefits derived. The position in England is similar (
 R v Horst Reiner Ilsemann 
, at p 403). The standard of proof required is proof on the balance of probabilities (s 46, DTA).
Where the court is satisfied that the realisable amount is less than the value of the benefits, it is obliged under s 7(2) to issue a certificate to that effect. As a matter of course, such a certificate should be issued by the court upon its decision. In contrast, if the realisable amount is larger than the benefits derived, the application of either the Public Prosecutor or a receiver appointed under the Act is required before a certificate to that effect is issued: s 7(4). That larger amount may be substituted into the confiscation order.
Thus the court would have to perform the following calculation: 
(a) benefits derived = unexplained property or interest 
(b) realisable amount = (value of realisable property - obligations) + value of gifts.
The confiscation order will prima facie be for the value in (a), but the realisable amount may be less than the amount of the benefits, and in such a situation, the confiscation order would be for the realisable amount only, rather than the value of the benefits derived from drug trafficking.
That this should be the correct approach is seen in the English Court of Appeal decision of 
 David Dickens 
, interpreting the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (DTOA). The DTOA is the legislative model for our own DTA: 
 
The provisions of this Bill are based largely on the United Kingdom Drug Trafficking Offences Act with modifications to suit local circumstances. [Minister for Home Affairs, (1992) 59 Parliamentary Debates 1375.]
 
 
 
The DTOA has been amended several times, and its provisions as well as those in, inter alia, the Criminal Justice Act 1993, are now found in the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.
In 
 Dickens 
, Lord Lane CJ, delivering the judgment of the court said at p 167: 
 
The sequence of the events as appears from the Act is as follows.
 
 
 
 
(1) ... If it is a case where the defendant may have benefited from drug trafficking, sentence must be postponed until after the necessary inquiries and determinations have been made. These are threefold: (a) whether he has benefited from drug trafficking ...; (b) the extent to which he has benefited ...; and (c) the amount the defendant shall be ordered to pay ... (2) The court determines ... the amount which represents the benefit he has received from drug trafficking. (3) The court determines the amount that the defendant shall be ordered to pay in accordance with s 4 of the Act [the equivalent of s 7 DTA].
  
 
 
Lord Lane then dealt with the assessment of the benefits, and said at p 169: 
 
The judge then hears the evidence on either side and reaches his conclusion (1) as to whether the defendant has successfully rebutted any provisional assumptions ...; (2) as to the existence of any benefit from drug trafficking; and (3) as to the value of such benefit.
 
 
 
That is however not the end of the matter. Section 4 provides that: 
 
` 
(1) Subject to subsection (3), below, the amount to be recovered in the defendant`s case under the confiscation order shall be the amount the Crown Court assesses to be the value of the defendant`s proceeds of drug trafficking ... (3) If the court is satisfied that the amount that might be realised at the time the confiscation order is made is less than the amount the court assesses to be the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking, the amount to be recovered in the defendant`s case under the confiscation order shall be the amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised.`
 
 
 
Thus, although the two exercises may overlap, where it is satisfied that the amount that might be realised is less than the value of the proceeds of drug trafficking, the court has then to carry out a further exercise to determine what the `amount appearing to the court to be the amount that might be so realised` is. If that amount is less than the proceeds of drug trafficking as found, the confiscation order will be for such lower sum.
 
 
 
The same should apply to the DTA, and in this regard, the district judge, with respect, was broadly correct in his approach. He referred for support to the case of 
 R v David Comiskey 
 (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 562. Tucker J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that the equivalent provisions of s 8(1) and (3) indicated that: 
 
what the court has to have regard to in determining the amount of the order is the actual property held by the defendant or by a person to whom he has given it [p 568].
 
 
 
However, it should be noted that in the case of 
 Re Goh Joon Tong 
 (OS 1064/94) (unreported), Kan Ting Chiu J said in the course of his grounds: 
 
... it is useful to understand what a confiscation order covers, and how the benefits are to be confiscated. When a court decides whether to make a confiscation order under s 4, it does not identify the property to be confiscated. Instead it sets out to `determine in accordance with s 7 the amount to be recovered` (s 4(2)).
 
 
 
In this determination, the court is assisted by the presumption in s 4(4) ...
The amount to be recovered is the amount which represents the benefits derived from drug trafficking. It does not relate to specific assets, eg proceeds from the sale of drugs or property bought with the money. Neither does it necessarily reflect the value of the property that the defendant has, as sub-s (4) covers property he holds or has held at any time. If a defendant cannot explain an excess of property of $1m over his known sources of income, a confiscation order for $1m will be made even if the total value of his property is only $100,000 when the order is made.
A few points have to be made about this statement by Kan Ting Chiu J. It is true that the amount to be recovered need not relate to specific assets, since the courts are concerned with only the money value of the benefits. It is also true that s 4(4) imports a presumption that assets disproportionate to known sources of income are derived from drug trafficking, and that expenditure is first met from such benefits as well. However, with respect, s 4(4) is only a presumption concerning whether benefits have been derived, and not the quantification of the benefits. It states that 
 a person who holds ... any property ... which cannot be explained to the satisfaction of the court ... shall be presumed to have derived benefits from drug trafficking. 
 The presence of the proviso to s 4(4) strengthens this interpretation. It states: 
 
Provided that any expenditure by such person (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been met out of his benefits derived from drug trafficking.
 
 
 
It is a circular proviso, assuming as it does the existence of derived benefits, but its effect is clear: it is presumed that any expenditure met by the defendant comes from money consisting of benefits of drug trafficking. It assists in the determination of whether the holding of a particular piece of property can be explained satisfactorily: in the absence of proof that the expenditure arose out of lawful income, the property acquired by that expenditure would be regarded as not being explained satisfactorily, which thus leads to the conclusion that benefits have been derived from trafficking.
It would also be strange for s 4(4) to be a presumption of quantification of benefits since it is s 5(1) which deals with the assessment of benefits derived. Indeed, the whole of s 4 is concerned rather with the precondition of a confiscation order - that is that benefits have been derived from drug trafficking.
Further support for this approach is derived from s 24 of the Act. Sections 4(4) and 5 do not apply to s 24, which deals with the position of a deceased defendant. Instead, there are ss 24(4)(a), (b) and (c). It is noteworthy that s 24(4)(a) is a presumption of derivation of benefits, corresponding closely to s 4(4). On the other hand, ss 24(b) and (c) correspond to s 5. The arrangement of the subsections of s 24 indicate that a clear line is drawn between ascertaining, firstly, whether benefits have in fact been derived, and the quantification of such benefits. Given the correspondence between s 24 on the one hand, and ss 4 and 5 on the other, it follows that ss 4 and 5 each serve different functions.
The approach in Singapore contrasts with that in England under the DTOA. In the English equivalent of s 5 DTA, s 2 DTOA, various assumptions are listed, which apply to the process of quantification unless rebutted by the defendant. These assumptions serve a different purpose from the presumptions contained in s 4(4).
The quantification of the amount to be recovered is governed by s 7. It follows then that, with respect, it is incorrect to say that: 
 
If a defendant cannot explain an excess of property of $1m over his known sources of income, a confiscation order for $1m will be made even if the total value of his property is only $100,000 when the order is made.
 
 
 
The true position is that if a defendant has property worth $1m that cannot be explained, under s 4(4) he is presumed to have derived benefits from drug trafficking. It is under s 5(1) that such property is considered to be benefits derived from drug trafficking: the benefits derived would be $1m. That would prima facie be the amount ordered to be confiscated: s 7(1). But this quantification is subject to the determination of what the realisable amount is: s 7(3). The realisable amount is determined to be the value of the realisable property held by him at the time of the order - that is $100,000 plus any gifts made and caught by the Act - less obligations having priority. In short, a confiscation order may well be made for the $100,000 only, if there are no gifts that are impugned. It is to be noted that such an order for the value of $100,000 would be made even if the actual property worth $100,000 that was derived from drug trafficking were no longer in the defendants` hands; it is sufficient that there is some property, however innocent, worth that amount.
 Application to the facts
The trial judge accepted that this was a situation in which a confiscation order had to be made. The statement tendered by the prosecution, and accepted by the defence, clearly indicated that the benefits derived from trafficking totalled some $43,918.10. No evidence or statement was adduced by the respondent to show that the realisable property was less than the benefits derived. In the court below, the prosecution apparently contended that the court had to order the confiscation of the full amount of the benefits derived, which accords with the 
 Goh Joon Tong 
 approach, though that case was not cited. For the reasons given, this contention could not be accepted.
In view of that lower amount, as disclosed in the prosecution`s own statement, the district judge held that s 7(3) applied - that is the realisable amount was less than the benefits derived. Thus, the amount ordered to be confiscated had to be restricted to the realisable amount.
There was an error in the quantification by the trial judge of the realisable amount. The prosecution`s financial statement listed the known realisable assets of the respondent as totalling $31,944.11. This the judge took to be the realisable amount. However, as noted in the discussion above, what may be confiscated consists of the value of the realisable property, which is the property held by the respondent and the value of any impugned gifts, less obligations having priority. Thus the realisable amount consists of the total assets of the respondent, that is the sum of $32,000 odd, together with gifts made and caught under the Act.
Here, the respondent had made a gift to his niece of the downpayment, rent and equipment for a food stall. Section 8(8) defines what gifts are caught by the Act: 
 
A gift ... is caught by this Act if -
 
 
 
 
(a) it was made by the defendant at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years ending when the proceedings for a drug trafficking offence were instituted against him ...; or 
 
(b) it was made by the defendant at any time and was a gift of property which is or is part of the benefits derived by the defendant from drug trafficking. (1)[gt ]The gift to the niece was made within the six year period specified in s 8(8)(a). It was then for her to challenge, if she desired and was able to, an order affecting any interest that she may have in the property (s 9). That was not done here, though it is still open to her to do so after the confiscation order is made (s 9(3)).
  
 
 
The realisable assets should have taken into account the gift made by the respondent to his niece. That gift consisted of the initial deposit, payment of rent, and the purchase of cooking utensils, amongst others. The total amount was some $24,000. Under s 8(2), the amount that is realisable consists of the value at the time of the making of the order of all the realisable property held by the defendant. The realisable property held by the defendant consisted, according to s 8(1), of the property held by him and any property held by a person to whom the defendant had made a gift caught by the Act. It is not necessary that such property remain in the hands of either the defendant or the recipient if it is an impugned gift from him. All that is required is that at some point it was in fact held by either, and that the proceeds of such property or gift remains with either. This approach is in accord with that in 
 Dickens 
, where the court had to deal with a gift of a car to the wife of the defendant, which car was subsequently sold to an innocent third party. The court held that the value of the car ought still to be taken into account, notwithstanding that the vehicle had been disposed of. This should be interpreted as catching the money obtained from the sale of the car: see 
 Mitchell, Hinton and Taylor on Confiscation 
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 1992), [para ] 5.100.
The equipment given to the niece was undoubtedly property held by the niece. The downpayment and the rent though were not clearly caught as property. But assistance is derived from s 2 of the DTA, where the term `property` is defined as: 
 
... money, and all other property, movable or immovable, including things in action and other intangible or incorporeal property.
 
 
 
The downpayment and rent conferred upon the niece contractual rights against the owner of the coffeshop where her stall was located. These rights were in fact what was really given to the niece. Such contractual rights were things in action, and hence, property for the purposes of the DTA.
The full sum of the gift to the niece would thus be caught. The value of such realisable property then has to be taken into account. On the facts of this case, the realisable property consisted of the assets actually held by the respondent plus the gift made to his niece, and these totalled some $55,944.11. That was larger than the benefits derived from drug trafficking.
Under s 7(4), where an application is made by the Public Prosecutor or a receiver appointed under the DTA, the court may certify the larger amount, and under s 7(6), the Public Prosecutor may in fact apply for a variation in the amount to be confiscated or in the default sentence. However, no such application has been made here thus far, and this court will not go into the question whether such a variation should be made.
Section 10 requires a default sentence to be imposed. That section reads: 
 
 
(1) ... where a court orders the defendant to pay any amount under section 4, section 224 of the Criminal Procedure Code shall have effect as if - 
 
(a) that amount were a fine imposed on him by the court; and 
 
(b) the term for which the court directs the defendant to be imprisoned in default of payment of any amount under section 4 shall be as follows: ... 
 
(ii) if the amount exceeds $20,000 but does not exceed $50,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years. 
 
...
  
 
 
 
(3) A District Court may, notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, impose the maximum term of imprisonment on the defendant in default of the payment of any amount ordered to be paid under section 4. 
 
...
  
 
 
 
 Conclusion
 
The confiscation order should have been made for the amount applied for by the prosecution, or $43,918.10. As the amount falls within s 10(1)(b)(ii), a default sentence of four years will be imposed upon the failure to pay that amount, pro rated for any amount actually paid. The appeal is accordingly allowed.

ss 42 & 65 Road Traffic Act (Cap 276)
 
The appellant in this case was charged with having committed an offence under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) by using a handphone whilst driving along the Pan Island Expressway on 26 July 1996. He was said to have held the handphone in his right hand whilst controlling the steering wheel of his vehicle with his left hand. On 24 September 1996 he pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced by the district judge to a fine of $300. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence in respect of all classes of vehicles for one year.
The present appeal was brought against the sentence of disqualification. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case. In particular, it was argued that the appellant had not in any way made it necessary for other road-users to take preventive action. I could see no mitigating value, however, in such a fact. In pleading guilty in the court below, the appellant admitted without reservation that his using the handphone whilst driving `lessened his ability to control his vehicle and [diminished] his concentration on the road`. It is patently clear, in short, that persons such as the appellant who make use of handphones whilst driving are deliberately laying themselves open to distraction from the task of driving. They show blatant disregard for the safety of their fellow road-users; and it scarcely lies in their mouths to say that no one appears to have been actually alarmed by their driving. The prospect of a sentence of disqualification is necessary to deter such inconsiderate and heedless drivers; and the district judge in this case was, in my view, justified in imposing such a sentence on the appellant.
I was further of the view, however, that the disqualification period of one year ordered by the district judge was manifestly excessive, having regard to the fact that the appellant was a first-time offender. For this reason, I allowed the appeal and ordered that the sentence of disqualification be reduced to six months.

s 28(b) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)
 
The petitioners sought revision of an order forfeiting a vehicle bearing registration number SCE 6015G (the vehicle) pursuant to s 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (MDA). The relevant portions of s 28 state: 
 
Where a person has been convicted of an offence under this Act, the court may order to be forfeited to the Government any ship, hovercraft, aircraft or vehicle which has been proved to have been used in any manner in connection with the offence except that -
 
 
 
... 
(b) no ... vehicle shall be forfeited under this section, if it is established by the owner thereof that the ... vehicle ... was unlawfully in the possession of another person without the owner`s consent.
 
 
 
The vehicle in question was registered in the name of one Ms Ramlah bte Reduan (the hirer). A hire-purchase agreement was executed on 12 August 1994 between the hirer and Citibank NA to finance the purchase of the vehicle. The petitioners were guarantors of the hire-purchase agreement pursuant to a motor dealer agreement with Citibank NA. The hirer`s sister, one Rahmah bte Reduan, was the other guarantor. Upon making full payment of all moneys due to Citibank NA under the hire-purchase agreement, the petitioners acquired all rights and interests of Citibank NA by way of subrogation.
On 4 September 1994, the vehicle was used by one Atan bin Joki (the accused) in the commission of a capital offence of drug trafficking. The accused was the husband of the hirer and he was the sole authorised driver of the vehicle. He was arrested and the vehicle was subsequently seized by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). The accused was eventually found guilty and convicted of a charge of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. On 7 August 1995, his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Crim App 23/95) (unreported). It was only after these proceedings were concluded that the CNB gave notice of their intention to forfeit the vehicle. The Registrar of the subordinate courts was notified that there were claimants to the vehicle. A magistrate was directed to convene a disposal inquiry at Changi Prison as the accused was already on death row.
At the conclusion of the disposal inquiry, held on 27 October 1995, the magistrate ordered the vehicle to be forfeited. The petitioners originally filed an appeal against the magistrate`s decision (MA 351/95). The appeal was permitted to lapse and deemed to be withdrawn, as the petitioners later conceded that there was no right of appeal from a disposal inquiry. The petitioners then commenced the present proceedings for criminal revision.
 The preliminary question - jurisdiction to convene a disposal inquiry
The question of forfeiture of the vehicle was not addressed at either the High Court or the Court of Appeal. It eventually arose for consideration before a magistrate. According to the CNB, the disposal inquiry was convened pursuant to s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC).
The DPP raised a preliminary objection, contending that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to convene a disposal inquiry, since there was no room for s 386 CPC to operate. This argument was premised on the following comments from the decision of this court in 
 Long Foo Jin v PP 
 
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 663
  (at p 666): 
 
There was no scope, contrary to the arguments of the appellant, for the holding of a disposal inquiry. ... Section 386 is clearly intended to apply only in a residual role, that is when the offence-creating provisions do not deal with the issue of the disposal of property used or concerned in any offence.
 
 
 
In addition, the DPP also referred to 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
 
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 523
  , in which this court held (at p 529): 
 
Where forfeiture is discretionary, special provisions governing forfeiture may be contained in the relevant legislation (eg s 20(4) Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed) or 
 s 28 Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)
) . ... In these cases, there is no room for s 386 CPC to operate. As I have stated in 
 Chandra Kumar
 and 
 Long Foo Jin
, s 386 CPC operates only in a residual role, that is when the offence creating provisions do not deal with the issue of the disposal of property used or concerned in any offence. [DPP`s emphasis.]
 
 
 
The DPP contended that s 386 of the CPC could not have operated to confer jurisdiction on the subordinate courts to hold a disposal inquiry, since s 28 of the MDA already deals specifically with the question of forfeiture in the case of drug offences. He pointed out that there was no time limit specified within s 28 MDA for an application for forfeiture to be made. Unlike s 386 CPC which states that the order must be made `during or at the conclusion of any inquiry or trial`, there were no similar restrictions in the MDA. He also submitted that as s 28 MDA was the only governing provision, the application to forfeit the vehicle would have to be made before the trial court, which would be the proper forum to consider the application.
In addressing these arguments, two issues had to be considered: 
(a) Does s 28 MDA operate to exclude the convening of a disposal inquiry under s 386 CPC? 
(b) Do the subordinate courts have jurisdiction to hold a disposal inquiry where the conviction was obtained in the High Court?
 Issue (a)
In 
 Long Foo Jin 
, I made the point that s 386 CPC would operate only in a `residual role` in response to the appellant`s argument in that case that a disposal inquiry pursuant to s 386 CPC ought to have been held. There was no scope for holding a disposal inquiry, since s 43(3B) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) was the `special provision` which governed forfeiture in that case.
I went on to state (at p 667) that where there is any objection to forfeiture, `[s]uch issues could and should have been raised upon the hearing of the application of the Public Prosecutor to forfeit the vehicle`. It is at that stage that all the relevant issues pertaining to the disposal of the vehicle have to be addressed. Assuming that a statute provides for discretionary forfeiture (eg s 28 MDA), it must contemplate the release of the property in the exercise of the court`s discretion. If forfeiture is not appropriate, the court will have to determine who is immediately entitled to possession. An order for delivery to that person will then have to be made. The proceedings culminating in the issuance of this order may be properly termed `disposal` proceedings.
Similarly, a statute may specify mandatory forfeiture upon the fulfilment of certain preconditions. If, however, the court determines that the preconditions have not been met, it must follow that the property has to be released to the person entitled to possession. Alternatively, the application to forfeit may have been entirely misconceived in law. Once again, the appropriate order would be to release the property to the person entitled to possession. These proceedings would be properly termed `disposal` proceedings as well.
The DPP rightly argued that applying the reasoning in
 Long Foo Jin 
 and 
 Magnum Finance 
, there would be no room for holding a disposal inquiry under s 386 CPC in the present case. However, as I have sought to clarify above, it would not follow that a disposal inquiry can never be held. It does not mean that a potential claimant to the property will be shut out altogether. After all, the power of forfeiture contained in s 28 MDA is a discretionary one, and the release of the property is clearly contemplated by s 28(b). A claimant will still have a right to be heard. The proceedings in which the court adjudicates on the claim to the vehicle would be properly characterised as a `disposal inquiry`. The question is where the source of jurisdiction to convene such an inquiry is found, if it cannot arise from s 386 CPC.
While there is specific provision in s 28 MDA governing forfeiture, it is silent on the 
 holding of an inquiry 
 where there are claimants to the property. It must be noted that there are at least three cases (
 Sing Hoe Motor Co Ltd v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 54
  ; 
 Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd v PP 
 
 
 
[1968] 2 MLJ 196
  ; 
 PP v Ong Ah Kau 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 31
  ) in which the Malaysian courts have ruled that where the specific forfeiture provision is silent on the holding of an inquiry, an inquiry under s 407(ii) CPC (the Malaysian equivalent of our s 386(2) CPC) should be held.
The leading authority is the 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 case, a decision of the Federal Court on a criminal reference from Kota Bahru. The criminal reference arose from an application for forfeiture of a vehicle seized under s 92 of the Road Traffic Ordinance No 49 of 1958. Section 92(4) reads: 
 
An order for the forfeiture or for the release of any motor vehicle seized under the provisions of sub-section (2) shall be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard thereto has been held, and an order for the forfeiture of such vehicle may be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that an offence against this section has been committed and that the vehicle was the subject matter of the offence, notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of such an offence.
 
 
 
The first question on reference was whether the power of forfeiture contained in s 92 was mandatory. The second was whether the true legal owner of the vehicle had a right to be heard before any order of forfeiture was made. The court ruled that s 92 provided for discretionary forfeiture. McIntyre FJ went on to address the second question as follows (at p 199): 
 
 
 It must follow therefore that the right to hold an enquiry for the purpose of exercising that discretion is implicit in that very power itself.
 We are of the opinion that the court has also legislative sanction to dispose of any property seized to any person by virtue of the provisions of ss 406A and 407(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code. An order made under these provisions is a judicial order and could be made only in accordance with the legal processes by which any court arrives at a decision.
 
 
 
In this connection, Dato` Wan Ismail [for the Public Prosecutor] contended that on a proper interpretation of s 407(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code the court is precluded from acting under that section since the question of forfeiture is governed by the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance. The Road Traffic Ordinance empowers the court at the close of a trial to forfeit or release a vehicle but is silent on the question of to whom it should be released in the event of a conviction. Therefore, 
 in our opinion, the court has to act under s 407(ii) to release the property to the true owner if satisfied that the offence has been committed without his consent, knowledge and connivance. In so doing the court would not be transgressing any of the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance but acting in furtherance of the objects of the Ordinance. 
 [Emphasis added]
In contrast with the Malaysian approach, in both 
 Long Foo Jin 
 and 
 Magnum Finance 
, I indicated that if there is a specific forfeiture provision, that provision should, whether expressly or by necessary implication, govern the holding of disposal inquiries where there are claimants to the property. The specific provision operates to exclude s 386 CPC. As stated in 
 PP v Chu Beow Hin 
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 135
  (at p 137), `where a special provision is made in a special statute that special provision excludes the operation of a general provision in the general law`. This restates the maxim 
 generalibus specialia derogant 
.
In 
 Chandra Kumar v PP 
 
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 123
  and 
 Long Foo Jin 
, the relevant statutes in question were the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed) (EPHA) and the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed). In 
 Chandra Kumar 
, reference was made to sub-ss (6), (7) and (8) of s 20 EPHA then in force. It was noted (at p 128) that these subsections would cover a situation similar to a disposal inquiry, where there was no prosecution with regard to an offence under the EPHA. It was also suggested that `where there has been a prosecution, s 20(4) and s 20(5) would be the applicable provisions`. Disposal would take place under s 20 itself. A similar approach was adopted in 
 Long Foo Jin 
 in relation to s 43(3B) of the Road Traffic Act. My reasoning, therefore, was that, although the forfeiture provisions may not have expressly provided for the holding of disposal inquiries, it must be implied from these provisions that the court has both the jurisdiction and power to convene a disposal inquiry if questions relating to the appropriateness of forfeiture and the entitlement to possession of the property should arise.
The upshot of the 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 approach is that, even where specific forfeiture provisions exist, s 386 CPC may still have to come into play if there are claims to the property. Of some 20 specific forfeiture provisions which I have identified from various different legislation, virtually all deal only with the question of forfeiture and the preconditions that have to be satisfied before an application to forfeit can be brought. It appears that there is only limited express provision in four instances for the holding of a disposal inquiry. These deal exclusively with the situation where no prosecution has taken place (see s 124 Customs Act (Cap 70, 1995 Ed), s 20(6), (7), (8) EPHA, s 117 Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) and s 4 Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (Cap 277)). If the 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 approach is followed, it would mean that s 386 CPC would still have to be invoked since there is no express provision for holding a disposal inquiry in the remaining 16 specific forfeiture provisions. As in 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 itself, s 386 may even have to be resorted to in the four `limited` instances identified above, since specific provision for a disposal inquiry only exists under those statutes in relation to cases where no prosecution takes place.
It should be noted that in s 386 CPC itself, Parliament has not made express provision as to how a disposal inquiry is to be convened or conducted. Indeed, s 386 CPC does not make any mention of jurisdiction in relation to the holding of a disposal inquiry. It does not provide any conclusive answer to where the source of jurisdiction is to be found. The section is concerned primarily with the disposal 
 orders 
 that may be made. This presupposes that the court has 
 jurisdiction 
 to hold a disposal inquiry if there are claims to the property.
The power of disposal in s 386 CPC `shall be exercised subject to ... special provisions regarding forfeiture ...`. Section 28 MDA is clearly one such special provision, providing for discretionary forfeiture. It is implicit in s 28 MDA that a disposal inquiry will have to be convened if there are claims to the vehicle. After all, the Federal Court in the 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 case has acknowledged (at p 199) that where a discretion to forfeit exists under specific provisions, `the right to hold an enquiry for the purpose of exercising that discretion is implicit in that very power itself`.
In my opinion, applying the reasoning in 
 Long Foo Jin 
, s 28 MDA would operate in the present case to exclude the convening of a disposal inquiry under s 386 CPC. However, the matter would not end there. For the reasons stated earlier, jurisdiction to convene the disposal inquiry emanated from 28 MDA itself and not s 386 CPC. I found no reason to depart from the recent views expressed by this court, where I had already indicated that the law in Singapore will proceed on a basis which is quite distinct from the 
 Chung Khiaw Bank 
 approach.
 Issue (b)
It appears that there are no authorities relating to the question of the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts to hold a disposal inquiry, where the accused has been convicted in the High Court. A complementary question which arose was whether the trial court would necessarily be the only proper forum to hold a disposal inquiry.
Section 28 MDA simply states that `where a person has been convicted of an offence under this Act, the court may order to be forfeited ...`. By necessary implication, the `court` must be the same court which has held the disposal inquiry. However, there is no corresponding indication that the `court` must invariably be the trial court, though the trial court should ordinarily be the forum where orders as to disposal of seized articles or case exhibits are sought.
Section 28 MDA may be contrasted with s 386(1) CPC, the relevant portions of which state: 
 
During or at the conclusion of any 
 inquiry or trial in any criminal court the court
 may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any document, livestock or property produced before it. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Section 386(1) CPC envisages that the `court` making the order should be either the trial court or the court which has conducted an inquiry. There is an inherent suggestion that the `court` need not be the trial court itself. However, it is silent as to whether the court ordering the disposal of property must be 
 the same court 
 which has tried and convicted the accused. The breadth of the wording permits reference to a different set of inquiry proceedings, other than the trial proceedings. Unfortunately, this does not really resolve the question whether any court other than the trial court has jurisdiction to hold a disposal inquiry. Reference must therefore be made to the specific legislation dealing with forfeiture, ie s 28 MDA.
In both s 386 CPC and s 28 MDA, the legislature has refrained from specifying that the `court` which deals with forfeiture must be the court which has convicted the accused. If Parliament had intended that only the trial court could have jurisdiction, this could easily have been expressly provided for. In this connection, it is pertinent to consider three different categories of forfeiture provisions and the phraseology employed therein. Provisions within the first category contain an express provision in respect of this issue of jurisdiction. A clear illustration is s 123(1) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 1995 Ed), which provides: 
 
An order for the forfeiture or for the release of anything liable to forfeiture under the provisions of this Act shall be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard thereto has been held.
 
 
 
From the terms of the above provision, only `the court before which the prosecution with regard thereto has been held` has jurisdiction to forfeit or release the vehicle. Other provisions having a similar or analogous effect are: 
a Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act (Cap 53) s 26 
b Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1995 Ed) s 49 
c Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap 146A, 1988 Ed) s 10 
d Medicines Act (Cap 176) s 60 
e Private Lotteries Act (Cap 250) s 13 
f Smoking (Control of Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act (Cap 309, 1994 Ed) s 27 
g States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act (Cap 316) s 40 
h Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338) s 7
On the other hand, there is a second category of provisions which specify that the order for forfeiture or release `may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under the relevant legislation has been or will be held`. These are: 
a EPHA s 20(5) 
b House to House and Street Collections Act (Cap 128) s 9 
c Regulation of Imports and Exports Act (Cap 272A, 1996 Ed) s 13 
d Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) s 117(2) 
e Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Act (Cap 277) s 4(3) 
f Timber Industry Act (Cap 325) s 14
For present purposes, it is unnecessary to examine the rationale for the distinction between the use of `shall` and `may` in the two categories of provisions enumerated above. Where the word `shall` is used, Parliament`s intention was clearly to confer jurisdiction specifically on the trial courts. The same cannot be said of s 28 MDA. There is no indication whether the court before which the trial took place `shall` or `may` make the relevant disposal order. It belongs alongside a third, or residual, category of forfeiture provisions which are silent as to whether the order for forfeiture or release `shall` or `may` be made by the trial court. Apart from s 28 MDA, the other provisions within this residual category which are worded in a similar fashion are: 
a Fisheries Act (Cap 111) s 14 
b Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) s 27 
c Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 1994 Ed) s 43(3B)
Having regard to the above considerations, I was of the view that the subordinate courts were not precluded from holding the disposal inquiry, as s 28 MDA does not impose any specific jurisdictional constraints. Section 34 MDA fortifies this view. The section provides: 
 
A District Court or a Magistrate`s Court shall have 
 jurisdiction to hear and determine all proceedings under this Act
 and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Criminal Procedure Code, a District Court shall have power to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of any offence provided by this Act except the punishment of death. [Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
On a restrictive reading, it would appear that s 34 is concerned with conferring enhanced jurisdiction on the subordinate courts, ie exceeding these courts` ordinary hearing and sentencing jurisdiction. However, I saw no reason why a literal interpretation should not be adopted. The legislature has chosen to frame the jurisdictional limits in broad terms in s 34. The section provides that `all proceedings under this Act` may be heard and determined by the lower courts. The word `proceedings` is not defined. In its ordinary and natural meaning, it cannot be confined solely to proceedings resulting in the conviction and sentence of an accused person.
The DPP further contended that the only proper forum to deal with the application for forfeiture (and the corresponding disposal inquiry) was the trial court. I would concur that s 28 MDA does not preclude an order of forfeiture being sought after the conclusion of the trial. It may be argued that the trial court has not discharged the function of determining whether forfeiture should be ordered. It remains incumbent on the trial court to do so upon an application for forfeiture being made, since this would be the first time that the question was arising for its consideration.
An equally viable argument, however, is that any other court can convene a disposal inquiry, since the question has arisen for consideration for the very first time. In any event, the proceedings in a disposal inquiry have nothing to do with the `mainstream` trial proceedings resulting in conviction and sentence. In principle, the trial and inquiry proceedings remain separate and distinct. A right of appeal is available in respect of the former, but not against an order made pursuant to a disposal inquiry. As far as the trial court is concerned, therefore, it may be 
 functus officio 
 in relation to the `mainstream` criminal proceedings which have resulted in conviction and sentence. While it may still have jurisdiction to hold a disposal inquiry, there is no reason why it should be the only proper forum to hear and determine the application for forfeiture and the disposal inquiry attendant upon the application. Indeed, ss 28 and 34 MDA do not impose any such limitation.
In my opinion, s 28 MDA would have provided the source of jurisdiction in the present case, and not s 386 CPC. I was also of the view that the subordinate courts were not precluded from exercising jurisdiction, notwithstanding that the conviction of the accused was obtained in the High Court. Having ruled on the preliminary objection thus, I proceeded to hear further arguments on the question of the exercise of discretion in forfeiting the vehicle.
 Whether forfeiture was justified
Under s 28 MDA, the burden was on the prosecution to show that there had been a conviction of an offence under the MDA, and that the vehicle had been used in any manner in connection with the offence. It was common ground that these two elements had been satisfied in the present case. It was also common ground that the petitioners were the legal and beneficial owners of the vehicle.
 (i) The exception in s 28(b)
The petitioners sought specifically to rely on the provision in s 28(b) of the MDA that no vehicle shall be forfeited, `if it is established by the owner thereof that the ... vehicle ... was unlawfully in the possession of another person without the owner`s consent`. Counsel`s argument was founded on the fact that the offence was committed while the vehicle was in the accused`s possession. The commission of the offence rendered his possession unlawful. As the petitioners were unaware of the illegal use of the vehicle, they were not capable of consenting to its use.
Two cases were relied upon by counsel, namely, 
 Eu Tong Sen Finance v PP 
 
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 29
  and 
 PP v Patani Motors Co Ltd 
 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 129
  . Both cases dealt with ss 30(2) and 30(7) of the (Malaysian) Dangerous Drugs Ordinance 1952 (DDO). Section 30(2) provided as follows: 
 
When any dangerous drug, in respect of which an offence under this Ordinance, or any breach of the restrictions or conditions subject to or upon which any licence has been granted, has been or is being committed, is found in any conveyance, such conveyance may be seized by any officer of customs or police officer and subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of this section, shall be forfeited, unless it is proved, to the satisfaction of the Court, that 
 the offence or breach had been or was being committed without the knowledge, consent or connivance of the owner.
[Emphasis mine.]
 
 
 
By s 2, a `conveyance` was defined to include a vehicle. Section 30(3) clarified that `no conveyance shall be forfeited under sub-section (2) ... unless the court shall have given the owner thereof or his agent an opportunity of showing cause why such conveyance should not be forfeited`. Section 30(7) further provided that the owner of a conveyance means `the person entitled to the possession of the same immediately before its seizure`. These provisions were in pari materia with those contained in s 30 of the Singapore Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No 7 of 1951, which was subsequently repealed by the enactment of the MDA in 1973. They also bore similar section numbers.
With the advent of the MDA, s 28 took the place of ss 30(2) and 30(7) in the local DDO. The scope of s 28(b) is clearly much narrower. Under s 30(2) DDO, the primary consideration was whether the `
 offence had been or was being committed 
 without the knowledge, consent or connivance of the owner`. Hence, the vehicle should not be forfeited where the owner was an innocent third party, uninvolved in the commission of the offence. In contrast, s 28(b) MDA simply focuses on whether the vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of another person (the accused) without the owner`s consent. Unlike s 30(2) DDO, s 28(b) says nothing about whether the owner knew, consented or connived in the commission of the offence.
The cases cited by counsel were therefore of little assistance in interpreting s 28(b). The petitioners suggested nonetheless that `a literal reading of s 28(b) appears to indicate that innocent parties who are unaware of the illegal usage of their vehicles should not be penalised`. From a plain reading of s 28(b), however, a vehicle is only `unlawfully in the possession` of the accused 
 if the means by which it came into his possession were unlawful 
. Thus, if the accused had obtained possession as a consequence of some criminally culpable act (eg theft, cheating, extortion etc), the vehicle would be unlawfully in his possession. 
 A fortiori 
, it would be in his possession without the owner`s consent. It would be implied that the owner would not have consented to the accused having obtained possession by the use of unlawful means. The above construction may suggest that the words `without the owner`s consent` are otiose. I did not believe that this was so, but rather that these words may have been inserted 
 ex abundanti cautela 
.
In my opinion, s 28(b) merely reflects Parliament`s intention that vehicles which have come into the possession of accused persons through unlawful means should not be forfeited. It says nothing about whether there was any unlawful purpose in using the vehicle. However, it should not be taken to mean that forfeiture will have to be ordered simply because the accused had obtained possession by lawful means. In determining whether the discretion to forfeit should be exercised, the court must consider the justice of each case.
In the present case, there was no suggestion that the hirer (the accused`s wife) had parted with possession after unlawful means had been employed. Moreover, the petitioners had actual or constructive notice of the accused`s status as an `authorised driver`. This could be taken to mean that the petitioners had impliedly consented to him being in possession of the vehicle. It follows that the accused was not unlawfully in possession of it.
Reliance was also placed by the petitioners on `automatic termination` clauses contained within the hire-purchase agreement. They argued that the hirer had `misused` the vehicle contrary to the terms of the hire-purchase agreement. As such, the right to possession immediately terminated and automatically reverted to the petitioners by virtue of cll 9 and 12(b). Any continued possession would thus be unlawful and lacking the owner`s consent. Clauses 9 and 12(b) state: 
 
Cl 9: The hirer agrees to comply with all laws and regulations relating to this Agreement and the goods and to assume all risks of liability arising for or pertaining to the operation and use of the goods.
 
 
 
Cl 12(b): If during the term of this Agreement ... Hirer shall fail to observe or perform any other provision or term of this Hire Purchase Agreement expressed or implied ... then upon occurrence of any such event, this (Hire Purchase) Agreement shall automatically and without notice terminate and the Hirer shall no longer be in possession of the goods with the owner`s consent ...
 
 
 
I was unable to see how these clauses were of any assistance to the petitioners as far as s 28(b) MDA was concerned. There was no explanation how the hirer had `misused` the vehicle. There was no suggestion from the petitioners that the hirer had connived with the accused, or was somehow guilty of complicity. If at all, the petitioners were contending that quite the contrary was true.
Clause 12(b) provides for legal possession to revert to the owner upon the commission of an offence. This was obviously designed to cater for s 28(b) MDA. With respect, it is immaterial for the purposes of s 28(b) that an offence was subsequently committed using the vehicle, if the accused had been lawfully in possession of the vehicle to begin with. There is no room for a shifting standard to apply. The accused was either lawfully in possession all the time or he was not. In any event, there was no suggestion that `unlawful possession` is to be determined according to whether the vehicle was used for an unlawful purpose.
The petitioners also argued that continued possession after automatic termination has been triggered is unlawful. As a matter of private contract, this could arguably be so. However, for the reasons given above, the argument did not bring them very far. It was not open to the petitioners to rely on the hire-purchase agreement as a contractual device to render lawful possession `unlawful`.
 (ii) The exercise of discretion
The operative words in s 28 MDA clearly state that `the court 
 may 
 order [the vehicle] to be forfeited`. Forfeiture is therefore a matter of discretion. Unfortunately, there are no authorities to provide guidance as to how the discretion should be exercised. It would be useful to consider the broad guidelines enunciated by this court in 
 Chandra Kumar v PP 
, applied recently in 
 Magnum Finance Bhd v PP 
. In the latter decision, I stated (at p 530): 
 
Generally, an important consideration will be the degree of complicity of the claimant in the offence. It may also be pertinent to have regard to the fact that he could not reasonably have taken any preventive measures regarding the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence. The value of the vehicle is relevant insofar as it should be considered whether forfeiture will be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the maximum punishment which may be imposed. The extent of use of the vehicle may be relevant where the offence was a continuing offence, or where the vehicle was used on several occasions for the illegal purpose.
 
 
 
 
 
 Magnum Finance 
 
 was a case where all the relevant considerations pointed away from forfeiture. The claimant was an innocent third party and was not involved in the commission of the offence. The car had been borrowed from the hirer by the accused. The offence itself (under s 140(1)(d) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353)) was not even considered sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence, let alone the maximum fine of $10,000. The accused was only fined $8,000.
In the present case, it was similarly argued that the petitioners were innocent claimants. They were not involved in the commission of the offence, nor did they agree to the use of the vehicle for illegal purposes. At the highest, the petitioners conceded that they were aware that the accused would use the vehicle, since he was listed as an `authorised driver` on the vehicle insurance certificate. They had nothing to do with the fact that he subsequently went on to commit an offence using the vehicle. They did not benefit from the commission of the offence. Finally, they had taken all reasonable steps in assessing the credit risk and financial background of the hirer and the guarantor.
In reply, the DPP contended that there were cogent reasons to justify forfeiture. In particular, it was submitted, following dicta from 
 Chandra Kumar 
 (at p 126), that `a disregard for the consequences of the use of [the] vehicle` could be relevant in showing some culpability on the part of the petitioners. They could reasonably have taken preventive measures regarding the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence. They failed to do so. Moreover, the value of the vehicle was not disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the maximum punishment which could be imposed.
The following facts were emphasised by the DPP in support of his submission. First, the real `hirer` was the accused, since he was the one who paid the initial down-payment of $18,600 in cash. Secondly, the certificate of insurance clearly showed that the hirer would not be driving the vehicle. The only authorised driver was the accused. Thirdly, the petitioners were well aware that the hirer was a person of very low means. She was a factory worker who was earning at the most $1,000 per month, less than the monthly instalments of $1,064.91. Fourthly, at the end of 34 instalments, the hirer still had to pay a final instalment of $53,144. This was clearly well beyond the hirer`s known means or legal sources of income. Finally, the accused was the one who paid the instalments and there was nothing to suggest that the hirer had obtained a windfall from other legal sources of income to pay for the instalments.
In the DPP`s submission, all the above facts ought to have set the alarm bells ringing. The petitioners had deliberately shut their eyes to the obvious fact that the car would most likely be used for some illegal purpose. In a sense, the petitioners had permitted the offence to be committed using the vehicle by failing to make reasonable enquiries or take any steps to prevent the illegal use of the vehicle.
The offence in question was clearly a serious one, attracting the mandatory death penalty. The magistrate accorded great weight to the seriousness of the offence in deciding that forfeiture was appropriate. He opined that the purpose of s 28 was to curb and impede offences under the MDA, and that exempting hire-purchase vehicles from forfeiture would `enable the hirers to defeat the aim of the section by using such vehicles to commit drug offences`.
In my opinion, while the nature and gravity of the offence cannot be ignored, this was insufficient by itself to justify forfeiture. Something more was required. In the present scenario, it would also have to be shown that in the circumstances, the petitioners were so grossly negligent in the manner they conducted their business that it could be said that they were `tainted with complicity` in having shown reckless disregard for the consequences of the use of their vehicle. The petition thus turned wholly on this question.
It was arguable that an order of forfeiture in the present case would not serve as a real deterrent against the use of vehicles for the commission of offences. There is already a mandatory death penalty in place under the MDA. It may be difficult to see how the prospect of forfeiture of vehicles may operate to pose any greater deterrence to would-be drug traffickers, or to the accused himself. On the other hand, the Minister for Law, while commenting on the justification for mandatory forfeiture provisions, has observed that forfeiture is in the public interest since it encourages hire-purchase companies, among others, to take precautions against the illegal use of their vehicles. This was essentially the same argument which was raised to support the DPP`s argument that forfeiture was justified in the present case.
Assuming that the petitioners had observed a reasonable and prudent standard of due diligence, a court should be slow to exercise its discretion to forfeit the vehicle. Parliament cannot expect all hire-purchase or car rental businesses to second-guess the latent criminal proclivities of their hirers or authorised drivers. The petitioners may not have been directly connected with the commission of the offence. However, in my opinion, they had clearly demonstrated reckless disregard for the consequences of the use of their vehicle. They went about almost perfunctorily in delivering possession of the vehicle to the hirer and enabling the accused to become the authorised driver of the vehicle. On the facts, they could be said to have been tainted with complicity.
I concurred with the DPP that the highly suspicious circumstances surrounding the hiring of the vehicle should have caused any reasonably prudent hire-purchase enterprise to have undertaken further enquiries. Instead, the petitioners saw no difficulty in placing the hirer in possession of the vehicle when she was patently in no position to pay for the vehicle. She did not even have a driving licence. There was no firm indication when, if ever, she would obtain one. She only made a bare assertion that she was learning to drive. Her own evidence was that she had acted on the accused`s instructions and had signed the necessary documents blindly.
It was pertinent to note the following sequence in her cross-examination during the inquiry proceedings: 
 
Q: Why did you purchase a car and have it registered in the name of Atan bin Joki?
 
 
 
A: Since I could not drive and my husband could, not wrong for my husband to drive.
 
 
 
Court: Not answering the question.
 
 
 
A: At that point of time, I was learning how to drive and 
 I thought that once I have a licence, I could use the car and that`s why I have it registered under my name and not my husband`s name.
 
Q: After [you] purchased the car, [you] have no control over it? 
A: I agree with that. [Emphasis added]
 
 
 
The credibility of her explanations was highly doubtful. It would be unfair to draw an adverse inference solely from the fact that she could not pay for the vehicle, or the fact that she was unable to drive. It is not unthinkable that persons may place acquired property or assets in the names of their family members for a variety of reasons. Alternatively, the vehicle may have been a gift from the accused. However, this was not the hirer`s stand. Rather, she maintained that it was her purchase, although she did not pay for it, and that she had registered it under her name. In almost the same breath, she agreed that she had no control over the vehicle after its purchase. In addition, it had to be noted that the accused and the hirer were not exactly well-off. The accused did not own any other vehicle. It was not as if he was in a position to lavish a gift of a vehicle on the hirer in anticipation of her obtaining a driving licence.
The petitioners contended that they had acted prudently in insisting on a guarantor for the hire-purchase, since they were aware that the hirer was a factory worker. In the words of counsel, the hirer`s financial situation was `found to be inadequate and as such the guarantor was included`. The guarantor was the hirer`s sister and was allegedly a clerk at the material time. Her financial status was apparently left unascertained. No details were stated as to how the petitioners arrived at the conclusion that both the hirer and guarantor would be able to discharge the monthly instalment payments. It transpired that the guarantor was equally a woman of straw.
Moreover, the accused was the one who had provided the initial cash payment of $18,600. The petitioners were aware that he was the authorised driver. To all intents and purposes, he was the beneficial owner of the vehicle. Even so, there was no indication of how or whether the accused himself would have been capable of providing the finances to maintain the instalment payments. For that matter, the evidence of Tan Bee Lian, a director of the petitioners, was that she was not even aware that the accused was paying for the instalments. Either way, there would have been no legal recourse against the accused. In view of this, it would have been even more imperative that the petitioners should have exercised a higher degree of circumspection.
In the circumstances, the petitioners were not wholly innocent claimants. Granted, they were not culpable in the sense that they did not actually know that any offence would be committed with the vehicle. They certainly did not benefit from the offence committed by the accused. It may even be somewhat fanciful to suggest, as the DPP did, that if the petitioners had made reasonable enquiries, this would have led to their concluding that the accused was going to use the vehicle for illegal purposes. However, if the petitioners had acted in a reasonably prudent manner, they could have made it much more difficult for the hirer and the accused to obtain possession of the vehicle. They failed to take this crucial step which might well have prevented the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence.
I was satisfied that forfeiture of the vehicle pursuant to s 28 MDA was an appropriate order. Accordingly, I dismissed the petition and affirmed the magistrate`s order of forfeiture.

Seow Fook Thiam (the appellant) was convicted by district judge Tay Yong Kwang on a charge of aggravated outraging of modesty under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The charge alleged that on 8 October 1996, at the second floor landing of the complainant`s residential block in Geylang, the appellant used criminal force on the complainant intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by using his hands to squeeze her breasts. It was alleged that, in order to facilitate the commission of the offence, he had voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to the complainant. The appellant was sentenced to 30 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He appealed against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s case
The complainant stayed in the block opposite the appellant`s block. The kitchen and bedroom windows of their third storey flats faced one another. Their children had played together in the same playground. The complainant and the appellant were known to each other.
On 8 October 1996, at about 6pm, the complainant left home to buy dinner for her family. On her way home, she met the appellant at the multi-storey car-park. He asked her where she was going. She replied that she was on her way home. The appellant followed the complainant and said that he wanted to collect the buboh-chacha container in which he had delivered his wife`s buboh-chacha the week before. Despite being told by the complainant that she had thrown the container away, the appellant continued to follow the complainant.
The appellant followed the complainant to the void deck of her block and asked her if there was anyone at her home. The complainant replied that her sister was waiting in the flat and walked up the stairs.
The appellant continued to follow the complainant. When she reached the staircase landing of the second level, he caught hold of her left hand from the back and hugged her from behind. The appellant put his arms around her and used both hands to squeeze her breasts.
The complainant shouted for the appellant to take his hands off her and for him to let go of her. The appellant let her go almost immediately and she ran one storey up to her third floor flat next to the staircase.
The evidence of the complainant`s sister, PW3, must be considered at this point. PW3 testified that she heard a loud shout:
 
 
Q: Just shouting or what? You don`t know who was screaming or shouting ? 
 
A: Just like `Ahhhh ... !` That`s why I asked, is that you? 
 
Q: You didnt`t go out to look or find out ? 
 
A: No. I asked, is that you and after a while, she came up already. I saw her in a few seconds. A few seconds she rushed up already, so I didn`t go out. I was at the gates. 
 
Q: What did she do then ? 
 
A: She looked very pale and I asked her what happened. 
 
Q: Maybe she was not feeling well ? 
 
A: Before she left, she was OK. That`s why I asked her what happened. 
 
Q: Then what ? 
 
A: She was quite nervous, I told her to calm down. I saw redness, like finger marks, on her left arm.
  
 
 
PW3 asked the complainant to report the incident to the police but the complainant wanted to wait until her husband returned before doing so. The complainant`s three children had returned home, and PW3 had to leave because her husband was waiting downstairs for her. Before leaving, PW3 went to the kitchen window to look across into the appellant`s flat and saw him entering his bathroom.
The complainant`s husband, (PW2) owned a stall selling chicken rice. On the day of the incident, PW2 returned home sometime after 9pm. PW2 testified that he noticed that the complainant was in a bad mood, but he did not think too much of this, even when his children told him that somebody had caught hold of their mother`s hand. It was only after the two eldest children fell asleep that the complainant told her husband about the incident.
During cross-examination, PW2 agreed that his wife had not mentioned and had not shown him any bruises on her arm. However, he confirmed that she had said that the appellant had caught hold of her arm very tightly.
PW2 accompanied his wife to the police station to report the incident. He said that, although they both could speak Mandarin, the policeman could only understand Hokkien. PW2 helped his wife to make the report because the complainant is Teochew and can only manage a smattering of Hokkien interspersed with Teochew. Both PW2 and the complainant were cross-examined as to why details of the molest were not given in her first police report made at the Neighbourhood Police Post. Their evidence was that the policeman had told them to leave the details to a later report to be made at the police station.
 The defence`s case
The appellant denied hugging or squeezing the complainant`s breasts. These denials were made against a background of allegations that he and the complainant were secretly involved. The scenario painted of their `secret affair` was of an `intimate` relationship devoid of sexual intercourse but which consisted of touching `here and there` on the few occasions they were together.
The appellant testified that on the date in question, 8 October 1996, he met the complainant at the multi-storey car park. She asked him to accompany her home and they proceeded to walk together. The complainant asked him if his wife would be jealous if she were to see them walking together. The appellant told her that they were only walking and asked the complainant if her husband would be suspicious if he saw them together.
The appellant asked if he could go to the complainant`s place but she said that her younger sister was at her home. When he told her that he would not go up, she retorted by saying that he did not dare to go up. He explained that he did not want to arouse her sister`s suspicions that they may be involved with each other. He then touched her hand and said goodbye.
The appellant returned home, took a shower and left for his mother-in-law`s home. He placed his pager on top of the television set. At about 9pm there was a reminder beep on the pager. He saw the complainant`s telephone number on the pager`s screen. The appellant did not call her as she had told him before not to call between 9pm to 10pm when her husband would come home. He did not know how many times she paged for him that night.
The thrust of the appellant`s allegations of an affair was that, in his intimate relationship with the complainant, he was privy to highly personal information about her. His evidence included: (i). that the complainant had seen him on the job in his previous occupation as a trishaw rider and had commented that it placed him in a useful position to speak to Japanese women;
 (ii). that they had started talking to each other across the windows of their flats. Whenever the complainant saw the appellant carrying out his household chores, she would comment that he was a good husband, telling him that her own husband had to work full-day everyday except on Thursday, his off-day;
 (iii). that the complainant would gesture her telephone number to the appellant. In addition, the appellant also claimed that he gave the complainant his pager number and that she would page him; (they had once been out to eat yong tau foo and there had been another occasion when the complainant had paged him to buy duck rice for her);
 (iv). that the complainant had told him her husband watched adult movies and that there was some banter between them as to whether either of them had any adult movies to lend the other;
 (v). that the appellant had gone to the complainant`s home four or five times to help her with her part-time work. On these occasions, they would become intimate (once, the complainant put her arms around him and held him tightly);
 (vi). that the complainant had on one occasion gone to the appellant`s home on the pretext of borrowing an umbrella but, upon entering his flat, headed straight for the master bedroom. She then lay on his bed and pulled him to her, causing him to fall onto her whereupon they were intimate with each other;
 (vii). that, in the course of their intimacy, the complainant had told him of her Caesarean operation and her 24 stitches. She had also told him these stitches hurt and for him not to hold her too tightly;
 (viii). that he was able to describe the complainant`s flat in detail - where the brown dressing table was, the position of the wedding photograph above the bed, the use of one bedroom as a store, and a white cordless telephone on a table outside the master bedroom;
 (ix). that the complainant wore a necklace with a talisman and, because it was sacred, they could not make love. The appellant had been told by the complainant that her husband had given her either the necklace or the talisman.
 
 
The appellant`s wife, DW2, testified that she did not know the complainant`s full name or telephone number. The complainant had told her that she could not have any more children, but DW2 did not know about the complainant`s Caesarean operation. DW2 denied telling any of this to her husband.
DW3 was a fruit seller living on the same level and in the same block as the complainant. He testified that during the seventh lunar month festivities, he had seen the complainant come up from behind the appellant, touch the back of the appellant`s neck and stand very close to the appellant. They kept smiling at each other while she rested her hand on the appellant`s nape. There were only three of them at the void deck as it was afternoon. In cross-examination, DW3 said that the complainant probably could recognize him as her neighbour.
DW4 was the appellant`s former neighbour and visited the appellant frequently, at least once or twice a month. He testified that on one of his visits during the same seventh month festivities, sometime after 6pm, the complainant approached the appellant to borrow matches. DW4 said that they then engaged in intimate talk. They laughed as they talked and stood very close to each other. The complainant had tapped the appellant`s hand.
DW4 asked the appellant who she was and was told that she was a neighbour. In cross-examination, DW4 said it was after the incident that he had seen the complainant from the appellant`s flat. However, he had not previously seen the complainant in her flat. DW4 only knew from the appellant that the lady staying opposite was the one who had touched the appellant at the festivities and who had later accused him of molest.
 Decision of the district judge
The district judge narrowed the issues to be (i) the existence of an affair between the appellant and the complainant; and, (ii) the degree and the purpose of the appellant`s touch. In his view, there was no dispute that the appellant was with the complainant at the time and the place alleged in the charge. It was also agreed that a shout had emanated from the complainant when the appellant touched her.
The district judge found the evidence of the prosecution`s two main witnesses, the complainant and PW3, entirely truthful and reliable. Their evidence was cogent and consistent and did not differ in any material aspect. The complainant`s description of the events surrounding the incident was reinforced and corroborated by PW3`s evidence on the scream and the complainant rushing upstairs thereafter.
As for the allegation of `wrongful restraint`, the district judge considered evidence that the appellant had let the complainant go, almost immediately upon her shouts to be released. However, the district judge found that by holding the complainant from behind and pulling her towards him, there was `wrongful restraint` within the meaning of s 339 of the Penal Code.
In contrast to the complainant`s evidence, the district judge found material parts of the appellant`s testimony `intrinsically unbelievable`. The district judge was of the opinion that it would have been schizophrenic behaviour on the part of the complainant, if his evidence was to be believed. According to the defence`s version of events, the complainant had asked the appellant to walk her home and had not dared to talk too much because her sister was around. Yet the complainant had shouted `ahhh ...` in response to his touch and gentle goodbye. The district judge found that there would have been absolutely no reason for the complainant to shout if there was something going on between the two of them. The district judge also noted the defence`s failure to put many matters to the prosecution`s witnesses for their response.
The district judge further observed contradictions in the appellant`s case. The appellant had put a version of the incident (that there was hugging) contradicting his defence (that there was no hugging at all on 8 October 1996) to the complainant. Another contradiction was where the appellant had maintained that the evidence in his police statement was the truth although it differed from his testimony given in court. Furthermore, the appellant had failed to explain why he had denied any affair with the complainant in his statement, saying that `she is only my neighbour.`
The district judge had no doubt that DW3 and DW4 were merely trying to support the appellant`s defence that he was having an affair with the complainant. Their testimony offered no concrete evidence and DW4`s evidence that the appellant had denied touching the complainant contradicted the appellant`s own testimony.
Finally, it was clear to the district judge that the appellant`s s 122(6) statement (exh P4) made in response to the charge and the notice of warning was an admission of guilt. The district judge did not accept the defence`s submission that the prosecution`s failure to call Sergeant Ang raised an adverse presumption against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). This was because Sergeant Ang`s role was peripheral to the actual recording of the statement.
 Appeal against conviction
The same arguments were canvassed at the appeal before me. The appellant contended that the district judge failed to give adequate consideration to the appellant`s evidence in deciding on the facts and that the complainant`s evidence was not `unusually convincing`. His submissions may be classified into two categories dealing with the following issues.
 The existence of an affair
The appellant contended that his ability to describe the complainant`s place in detail was evidence of his intimate relationship with the complainant. This was despite the absence of evidence to prove that he could have known this just by observing from his flat opposite.
The appellant`s knowledge of the complainant`s call-back facility, for example, was something he claimed that even the complainant`s husband was unaware of. In my view, considering the complainant had earlier agreed that most of her neighbours knew about her Caesarean operation, much less intimacy should be assumed of a relationship where information about one`s subscription to the call-back facility is exchanged. I had no difficulty agreeing with the district judge`s finding that such knowledge was `nothing exceptional`.
The district judge went on to add that `it was quite plain from the appellant`s own testimony that he had been paying close attention to the complainant before and after the incident on 8 October 1996`. This was clear from the appellant`s testimony in re-examination:
 
 
Court: You have never seen the victim in her bedroom ? 
 
A: When cleaning my windows, I could see her taking a shower in her master bedroom. I mean, finished taking a shower and wrapped in a towel.
  
 
 
The appellant contended that information such as the complainant and her husband`s bathing habits could only be known to him as the complainant`s lover. However, despite the alleged significance of this, such allegations were not put to either the complainant or PW2. Furthermore, the appellant`s own evidence above suggested that it was not impossible for him to observe such `bathing habits` when cleaning his windows.
I saw no reason to disagree with the district judge`s findings of the defence`s evidence. In para 138, he observed:
 
It was intriguing that the accused talked of intimacy, of a secret or close relationship with the complainant but stopped short of saying they had sex or had even seen each other`s bodies. He explained that they could not have sex because of the talisman the complainant was wearing but went on to say that it was alright if the talisman was kept inside the neck of the complainant`s T-shirt. In my opinion, he was quite assiduous in maintaining that he would have been unable to describe where the 24 stitch-marks on her abdomen were if he were to maintain otherwise and was challenged. I found his testimony that they would hug and kiss and fondle but only with their clothes on in a relationship which had started in February/March 1996 quite unbelievable, especially in the light of his testimony that the complainant had gone into his flat like a tigress on the prowl and had made a beeline for his bedroom and his bed and then caused him to fall on her by her forceful tug.
 
 
 
 
 The extent of the appellant`s touch
 
The appellant contended that the complainant had failed to mention the bruises to her husband. However, it was never suggested that the appellant`s hold of the complainant`s arm caused bruising nor was it necessary to do so to prove `wrongful restraint`. Instead, the complainant`s testimony referred to the redness produced by the appellant`s tight grip on her left arm. This `redness` was again brought up in PW3`s evidence of her independent observation.
The appellant had further contended that there was a material discrepancy in the testimonies of PW2 and PW3 as to exactly when the complainant related the molest to PW3. This contention could not be correct because the material fact remained that PW3 noticed the `redness, like finger marks, on her left arm` without the complainant bringing it to her attention. Therefore it was irrelevant 
 when 
 the molest itself was related to PW3, whether immediately after the complainant rushed in or a short while later. In any case, it could not have been much later, since PW3 had to leave in a rush because her husband was waiting downstairs for her.
The district judge made the following findings in paras 141 and 142 of his grounds of decision:
 
In summary, I found the prosecution`s two main witnesses, the complainant and her sister, entirely truthful and reliable although they differed somewhat concerning the number of children at home and the house keys. What was material was whether the accused had accosted the complainant on the staircase landing that day and had done the acts specified in the charge. The evidence of the complainant on the events immediately preceding the incident and the incident itself was cogent and consistent. Her sister`s evidence on the scream and the complainant rushing upstairs thereafter reinforced and corroborated the complainant`s testimony as to what had transpired on the landing. Even if the accused had released the complainant immediately upon her scream and shouts to let her go, there was still `wrongful restraint` within the meaning of s 339 Penal Code which reads :
 
 
 
`Whoever voluntarily obstructs any person, so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said wrongfully to restrain that person.`
 
 
 
One can obstruct another by blocking him at the front or by otherwise preventing or retarding his progress from behind, beside or even beneath him. The accused had wrongfully restrained the complainant by holding her from behind and pulling her towards him.
 
 
 
I had no doubt that the accused was telling blatant lies about his alleged relationship with the complainant. Not only were material parts of his testimony, especially on the events immediately preceding the incident and the incident itself, intrinsically unbelievable, he had also failed to put many matters to the prosecution`s witnesses for their response. He had, however, put a version of the incident (that there was hugging) contradicting his defence (that there was no hugging at all on 8 October 1996) to the complainant. Further his statement in exh P4 (the s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code statement) in response to the charge and the notice of warning was clearly an admission of guilt.
 
 
 
I agreed entirely with these findings.
 Appeal against sentence
The appellant contended that, since the district judge had noted that the wrongful restraint and the molest were not prolonged, the sentence passed was manifestly excessive. Section 354A(1) Penal Code provides for mandatory imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than ten years and for mandatory caning. The norm for offences under this section is 30 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
The appellant`s allegations of an affair raised evidence of a sensitive and personal nature. I agreed with the district judge`s observations in para 148 that `the accused`s attempts to save himself by casting totally unfounded aspersions on the complainant`s character were extremely wicked` and found such a line of defence extremely malicious. Accordingly I confirmed the sentence imposed in the court below.
For the reasons set out above, I dismissed both appeals.",1997-08-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

 Background
This is an action for injurious or malicious falsehood, malicious prosecution, trespass to property and trespass to goods.
The plaintiff company Challenger Technologies Pte Ltd (Challenger) was incorporated in October 1984 and was/is, in the business of retailing computer products. Challenger operates a retail outlet called Challenger Superstore (the Superstore) in North Bridge Road at Funan Centre, which is well known for its many stores retailing computer-related products.
The defendants, Dennison Transoceanic Corporation (DTC) were a wholly owned subsidiary of an American company, Dennison Manufacturing Company. In 1990, Dennison Manufacturing merged with another American company, Avery International Corporation to form Avery Dennison Corporation (ADC). DTC therefore became a subsidiary of ADC. The trademark `Avery` is owned by the defendants` parent company and was duly registered in the Registry of Trademarks in 1972.
ADC manufactures the Avery range of adhesive labels for use by various types of computer printers. In addition, it developed a software programme, `LabelPro` which was designed to make the printing of such labels convenient.
In early 1993, Malcolm Gray (Gray), then managing director of Dennison Far East (HK) Ltd, a subsidiary of Dennison Manufacturing Corporation, instructed Charles Liew Wing Onn (Liew) to prepare for the Singapore launch of the LabelPro software programme and the Avery line of labels. In the course of his preparations for the launch, Liew ( DW2) visited Funan Centre. The purpose of these visits was, in his words 
 
... to update myself on the computer business, because I know that I was going to introduce a product which is related to that industry, so I decided to go there for a market survey (N/E 470).
 
 
 
Liew`s attention was drawn to Challenger`s sale of Avery labels on one occasion when he visited the Superstore at Funan Centre although there is some confusion over exactly when this happened. Challenger had put on display boxes of `Avery Computer Labels`. However, the packaging of these boxes was completely different in design from Avery`s original packaging (see P3 and P4); the package had the words `Avery Computer Labels` printed on it. It further had `Challenger[trade ]` printed on the top right corner of it. A stick-on label indicating the code number of the product was also affixed on its bottom right corner. Liew`s suspicious were aroused by the nature of the packaging. It is to be noted that boxes of Avery labels in their original packaging were also displayed side by side with those in the packaging unfamiliar to Liew.
Liew contacted his immediate superior Gray (DW1), who requested that Liew fax a copy of the suspect packaging to him. After having sight of the fax copy, Gray instructed Liew to contact Arthur Moore (DW8), who was ADC`s chief patent counsel based in California as well as to consult the law firm of Rodyk & Davidson (R & D), who had previously advised ADC on infringements against its LabelPro software. Mr Gilbert Leong (Leong), a solicitor with R & D, subsequently wrote a letter dated 21 April 1993 (AB45), which sought the approval of Avery to conduct raids on Challenger for the suspect labels and the software pirates for the LabelPro software. The relevant portions of that letter are as follows:
 
... On a separate but related matter you might wish to know that Mr Charles Liew informed us yesterday that computer labels bearing the name `Avery` were being marketed by a store in Singapore. This store, Challenger, sells both original and infringing `Avery` labels. Enclosed is a copy of the packaging used by the shop for its infringing labels. The name `Avery` is rather prominent and we have ascertained that such use is an infringement of your trade mark No 56317 `Avery` in Class 16.
 
 
 
Based on the provisions of the Trade Marks Act, a raid may be conducted and Challenger be hauled to court for infringing your trade mark rights. Challenger is a major retail store which sells computer peripherals and consumables. Mr Charles Liew and us are of the opinion they ought to be raided and taken to task. This raid should be conducted simultaneously with the raid on the other retail shops selling the pirated software. The raids ought to be conducted in such a manner because if Challenger is raided, it would be a clear indication to the software pirates that you are taking action in the marketplace and having been `warned`, the software pirates would lie low and all our efforts would be wasted ...
 
 
 
By a letter dated 23 April 1993 (AB47), Richard Randall (DW3), who was, and is, assistant general counsel with ADC and Arthur Moore`s colleague and who had authority to act on the matter, wrote:
 
Dear Mr Leong:
 
 
 
In reference to your letter of April 21, 1993 to Mr Moore and the Challenger documents provided by Mr Charles Liew, this is to advise that you should proceed against Challenger Superstore for trademark infringement. Mr Moore is travelling this week and part of next. However, I have been in contact with Mr Moore and Mr Sharp at our Avery Division, and we all believe that it is appropriate to take action against Challenger. ...
 
 
 
In respect of both the LabelPro software and the Avery labels, ADC was concerned about the costs of executing the raids as recommended by R & D. In a letter dated April 27 1993 (AB54), Randall wrote to Leong: 
 
 
1 You are authorized to conduct a `raid` against one of the offending retail outlets selling the pirated LabelPro software. We trust that this will be a fairly rapid, `summary` process and that the offending retailer will quickly discern that he is `in the wrong`. We do not expect a protracted legal process. We see the principle (sic) advantage from this procedure as `spreading the word` among other retail outlets, and thereby discourage others from pirating our software ... 
 
3 With respect to Challenger, please advise how many locations would be raided at one time. I can understand that we would need to cover several Challenger outlets, but do we need to cover 
 every 
 outlet? ...
  
 
 
In response, Leong wrote on the same day (AB52):
 
... Since Avery does not wish to embroil itself in legal proceedings, we would file only criminal charges against the retailer/pirate. With the evidence obtained during the raid, we do not expect them to claim trial and in all probability, they would plead guilty to the charges. The matter would then end there. Please note that in criminal proceedings, it would not be possible to claim costs against the pirate ...
 
 
 
... As with the software pirate, we should commence criminal prosecution against Challenger. At the same time, we should threaten to take civil action against them even if at the end of the day, no suit may be filed. If they wish to avoid the publicity of a civil suit and also not pay damages to Avery, we may negotiate with them to provide you with an undertaking not to further infringe ...
 
 
 
Randall replied on 28 April 1993 again highlighting the concern of Avery that the measures undertaken be `cost-effective`.
 
 
1 I have reviewed and noted your comments concerning the raid against one of the software retailers. We understand that legal action will have to be taken against the infringer after the raid, and this will take a period of time. You are correct that you should only file criminal charges against the retailer/pirate. We understand that we will not be able to claim costs against the pirate in the criminal action. Please advise if, as a consequence of the raid, you determine that the retailer would be in a position to pay costs and damages which could then justify filing a civil action against the pirate ... 
 
2 With respect to Challenger Superstore, I note your comment that there is no need to raid every outlet. I agree that you should raid their principal store and warehouse simultaneously. You will then pursue criminal prosecution against Challenger, and additionally threaten civil action. With respect to Challenger, we would prefer to obtain costs and damages if such a proceeding would be `cost effective.` I assume that the evidence in our favor will be overwhelming, particularly after the criminal proceeding, and that Challenger has the financial resources to pay costs and damages. If Challenger were willing to pay our costs, account for and pay over profits, and deliver the remaining infringing goods, that would be acceptable to Avery Dennison.
  
 
 
Leong thereafter contacted a firm of private investigators, Commercial Private Investigation and Security (CPIS) instructing it, inter alia, to prepare to raid the Superstore and Challenger`s warehouse located at Challenger Building on Burn Road (see AB74). On 10 May 1993, CPIS operatives made a trap purchase of the suspected infringing labels from the Superstore. It was also in the operatives` report that Challenger had at least 200 suspect boxes with various codes on sale at the Superstore. Thereafter, R & D gave the go-ahead to CPIS to prepare for the raid. As a result, CPIS drafted a complaint on behalf of Liew which, after certain inconsequential amendments by Leong, was sworn by Liew before a magistrate on 17 May 1993. Liew`s complaint reads as follows:
 
The complainant being examined on oath states:
 
 
 
I am the manager of Dennison Transoceanic Corporation of Blk 4 Pasir Panjang Road, [num ]09-13 PSA Distripark, Singapore 0511 which is the Singapore branch of Avery Dennison Corporation, the Trademark proprietor of `Avery` under Class 16 (Certificate of Registration No 56317).
 
 
 
My parent company has retained and instructed Commercial Private Investigation and Security (CPIS) to investigate Challenger Micro Pte Ltd/Challenger Technologies Pte Ltd (Challenger) believed to be dealing in computer labels that were infringing the registered trade mark of `Avery`.
 
 
 
On 10 May 1993, investigators of CPIS went to Challenger`s outlet located at 109 North Bridge Road, [num ]05-11/17 Funan Centre, Singapore 0617 to make a trap purchase of the said infringed labels. A box of `Avery` computer labels was purchased for S$9.00. There were about 200 boxes of such computer labels available for sale at the outlet. Upon examining the box of computer labels, I confirmed that it was not an original product manufactured by my parent company or its branches or with its consent or license. Challenger has therefore committed an offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act.
 
 
 
Subsequent investigation conducted by CPIS revealed that Challenger has a warehouse located at 62 Burn Road, Singapore 1336.
 
 
 
In the light of the foregoing, I have reasonable cause to suspect that counterfeit `Avery` products are kept at the premises of 109 North Bridge Road, [num ]05-11/17 Funan Centre, Singapore 0617 and 62 Burn Road, Singapore 1336. I pray for search warrants to be issued under s 62(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to enter the mentioned premises in order that a search may be conducted in the premises and action taken to seize the counterfeit `Avery` products and documents relating to the act of the infringement.
 
 
 
The complaint was sworn before the magistrate at the subordinate courts by Liew who was accompanied by Leong as well as, Tan Chin Huat and Tan See Wei from CPIS. Two search warrants, 68 and 69 of 1993 (for the Superstore and the Burn Road raids respectively) were issued by the magistrate in the standard form and I set out the following paragraph from the former which is replicated in the latter except for the address:
 
Whereas I have received information and on due inquiry thereupon had I have been led to believe that 109 North Bridge Rd [num ]05-11/17 Funan Centre (0617) is in possession of articles infringing the registered trade mark of `Avery` thereby contravening s 73 of the Trademarks Act (Cap 332).
 
 
 
Afterwards, Liew, Tan Chin Huat and Leong made their separate ways to Funan Centre while Tan See Wei went to Burn Road to execute the raid against the Challenger warehouse. Liew had earlier contacted the 
 Business Times 
 and the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 concerning the proposed raids in order that they might be given coverage by the local press. As a result, Paul Leo Teng Son (PW5) and Teo Meng Lian (PW6) from the 
 Business Times 
 and 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 respectively, followed the party raiding the Superstore. That party consisted of Leong and his assistant from R & D, Liew, Tan Chin Huat and another investigator from CPIS.
The Superstore raid was executed at about 2.25pm. The raiding party seized 204 boxes of the suspected infringements of various codes as well as documents. The Burn Road raid was executed more or less simultaneously and 27 boxes of the same items were seized from that location together with 67 empty boxes. At Funan Centre, the chief executive officer of Challenger, Loo Leong Thye (Loo) who was present, protested that the labels were genuine Avery labels. He attempted to locate documentary proof of this. However, when Loo (PW1) produced two export packing lists, the raiding party was of the opinion that this was (in the words of Liew in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief), `not sufficient to prove that their suspected goods were genuine.`
Two days after the raids, on 19 May 1993, the 
 Business Times 
 carried an article headlined `US software company finds fake laser labels in raid on Challenger.` Two days later on 21 May 1993, the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 published a report on the raids headlined `A Computer Sales Company is raided ... More than 10,000 pieces of paper label products are recovered.` The plaintiffs alleged that these articles were highly damaging to them.
Immediately after the raid, R & D wrote to Arthur Moore and Richard Randall to keep them apprised of the situation. Leong was concerned over assertions by Challenger that the labels were genuine and asked that ADC investigate if they had actually supplied the labels indirectly to Challenger and if the labels were indeed genuine. For this purpose, he enclosed samples of the labels seized. He also enclosed the export packing list which was issued by one Columbia Computer Products Inc (Columbia) of Monterey Park, California.
It turned out that the suspected infringing labels were genuine Avery labels that had been purchased by Columbia, a subsidiary of Challenger, from Avery through Personal Electronic Sales (PES), which is described by Loo in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, as Avery`s manufacturer`s representative. Columbia had purchased a range of Avery labels including the so-called `Mini-line` series (see P2) which came in boxes of 500 to 1,000 labels. In addition, it had also ordered larger packages of 5,000 to 10,000 labels called the `Tabulabel` range (see P1). It appears that Challenger had some difficulty selling the latter at the Superstore primarily because of the low demand for such big quantities by its customers. As a result, it decided to break up the packages into more marketable quantities of 500 or 1,000 labels and repack them.
Challenger, on legal advice, took the position that the labels were genuine and therefore no offence under s 73 of the Trademarks Act had been committed. It further took the view that the magistrate had no reasonable cause to suspect that such an offence had been committed on the face of Liew`s complaint and that, therefore, the search warrants were flawed. By way of a letter dated 21 May 1993, Challenger`s solicitors, Chu Chan Gan & Ooi (CCGO), wrote to R & D to demand the immediate return of the seized goods failing which it threatened to file a motion for dismissal of the complaint and to quash the search warrant.
Previously, on 19 May 1993 (AB96A), Richard Randall wrote to Leong concerning the investigations into sales by Avery to Columbia. The salient aspects of the letter are as follows:
 
... Attached are two invoices concerning sales of Avery brand products to Columbia - one in 1992 and one in 1993. Please note that there have been sales of 4030, 4060 and 4177 products.
 
 
 
I have also had conversations with sales, marketing and credit employees of Avery Division of Avery Dennison Corporation. These conversations, along with my conversation today with Mr Eric Ng, president of Columbia, lead me to believe that the following has transpired:
 
 
 
 
1 Avery Division, through a particular distribution channel, has sold (indirectly) products to Columbia with the knowledge that Columbia would re-sell in Singapore. Since 1992, Challenger has been selling Avery brand products in Singapore, generally in the original packaging. 
 
2 Some of the Avery brand products were sold to Columbia in fairly large (bulk) sizes (as requested by Columbia). The sizes turned out to be too large and therefore difficult to sell in Singapore (because of the number of labels per package). 
 
3 Challenger (in good faith, but without requesting permission from Avery Division) decided on their own initiative to repackage some of the Avery brand products, so they would be in a position to sell in the Singapore market. 
 
4 You and our investigators, in good faith, believe that these products were not properly trademarked, and most likely, were counterfeit products based on the appearance of the Challenger packaging.
  
 
 
I understand from Mr Liew and Mr Ng that there has been some publicity in the 
 Business Times
 in Singapore to the effect that Challenger has been selling counterfeit labels. Based on the above information, I am reasonably confident that Challenger has been selling genuine Avery brand products, but without permission to repackage some of the products. Therefore, by copy of this letter to Mr Liew, I would ask him to co-ordinate with you to prepare an appropriate statement in which we correct the record in the 
 Business Times
, explaining the good faith misunderstanding on the part of both companies.
 
 
 
You should also be aware that, because of the long and fairly complicated distribution patterns, Avery Division in the United States was not aware, and could not have been aware, that Challenger was an ultimate customer of Avery brand products.
 
 
 
I suggest that Mr Liew meet with Mr LT Loo, the chief executive of Challenger, so that the businessmen can clearly understand the facts and circumstances surrounding this situation. Mr Ng has made it perfectly clear to me that he, as well as Challenger, has every intention of properly representing Avery brand products, and that they did not intend to create an issue or problem with respect to the repackaging of materials. I explained to Mr Ng that we have had difficulties in Singapore and elsewhere with `pirated software` and similar issues. Mr Ng understands that we want to present Avery brand products with `uniform` packaging and trademarks throughout the world, particularly with our laser brand products.
 
 
 
My telephone conversation with Mr Ng was most cordial, and he was most co-operative and sensitive to our concerns. Likewise, we need to be sensitive and concerned about their business reputation and image in Singapore. ...
 
 
 
On 22 May 1993 (AB106), R & D replied to CCGO asking that Challenger hold their hands on the matter until their clients could ascertain the authenticity of the labels. Challenger, however, was not amenable to this request and retorted that Avery should have checked the origin of the labels before taking out the search warrants. Nevertheless, Challenger did not file the criminal motion at this stage.
On 2 June 1993 (AB111), Arthur Moore sent a fax message to R & D in the following terms:
 
We have completed the analysis of the Challenger labels and determined that it is unlikely they were manufactured by a party other than Avery Dennison. Accordingly, you are authorized to release the seized goods to Challenger.
 
 
 
In the meantime, R & D had written to CCGO indicating Avery`s willingness to return the labels depending on the outcome of Avery`s testing of their authenticity. By 9 June 1993, the labels had still not been returned to Challenger. Criminal Motion 18 of 1993 (the motion) was therefore initiated seeking that the complaint brought by Liew be dismissed and the search warrants quashed (see AB113). On 14 June 1993, Avery returned the labels to Challenger. Notwithstanding the return of the labels, Challenger proceeded with the motion, their intention being to `set the record straight` (AB226).
The motion was heard by Lai Kew Chai J in June 1993 and he delivered judgment on 22 March 1994 (see 
Challenger Technologies Pte Ltd v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 446
  ) dismissing the complaint of Liew, quashing the search warrants and ordering the return of the goods and documents seized. The issue before Lai Kew Chai J was whether DTC was justified in alleging an offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed) (the Act). The learned judge examined the relevant provisions and was of the opinion that s 73B(5) creates 
 
... a presumption, that a trade mark shall be presumed to have been falsely applied, if it was applied without the assent of the proprietor of the trade mark. In my view, this presumption can be rebutted by proof that the registered trade mark was applied to goods belonging to the proprietor - goods against which the trade mark was registered (at p 452D).
 
 
 
He was further
 
... persuaded that for an offence to be made out under s 73, the product to which the registered trade mark is applied must be spurious or adulterated, that is, it must not be genuine. Adopting a purposive interpretation of the section, it seeks to outlaw the application of a mark without the assent of the proprietor - an act that is calculated to deceive customers into believing that the goods were genuine, when they were not (at p 452E).
 
 
 
The learned judge held that no offence had been committed under the Act because Challenger had at every stage proved that they dealt with genuine goods.
 Malicious prosecution
In order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff must prove: (1) that the defendant had commenced criminal proceedings against him on a criminal charge; (2) that those proceedings determined in the plaintiff`s favour, if they were of such a nature as to permit of that outcome; (3) that the defendant`s conduct was without reasonable and probable cause; and (4) that the defendant was actuated by malice (see 
Zainal bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian Michael & Anor
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 121
  at p 137).
In relation to the first and second elements, Mr Yim for the defendants did not take issue with the plaintiffs. He did point out however, that the proper cause of action was for maliciously procuring a search warrant and not malicious prosecution, referring to the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in 
Reynolds v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis
 
[1984] 3 All ER 649
 . In that case, the court recognised that the malicious procuring of a search warrant without reasonable and probable cause was an actionable wrong. This tort is analogous to that of malicious prosecution. However, it dispenses with the strict requirement of the first two elements. In the context of search warrants, there is, strictly speaking, no commencement of criminal prosecution nor is there any determination in favour of the plaintiff, the application being ex parte in nature. The courts have nevertheless found defendants liable for maliciously procuring the search warrants without reasonable and probable cause whether under the torts of malicious prosecution (see 
 Fitzalan v Nicholson 
 (1896) 13 WN (NSW) 51) or malicious procurement of a search warrant (see 
 Reynolds 
, ibid). In the present case, the crucial inquiry turned on the issues of reasonable and probable cause and malice and it is to these I now turn.
 Reasonable and probable cause
We begin with the oft-cited passage from Hawkin J`s judgment in 
Hicks v Faulkner
 
[1878] 8 QBD 167
 , at p 171 where the learned judge defined `reasonable and probable cause` as
 
An honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinary prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed.
 
 
 
This passage was subsequently approved by the House of Lords in 
Herniman v Smith
 
[1938] AC 305
 (per Lord Atkin) and by our Court of Appeal in 
 Zainal bin Kuning v Chan Sin Mian Michael 
 (supra). In 
 Zainal 
`s case, the Court of Appeal, citing the House of Lords in 
Glinski v McIver
 
[1962] AC 726
 , explained that `(t)he degree of guilt believed by the prosecutor need not extend to a belief that the accused would be convicted but whether there is a case fit to be tried`. I agree with Mr Rada`s contention that this must be more than mere suspicion; there must be credible evidence which, assuming it is true, would lead the reasonable man to believe that the offence had been committed but this does not mean that the prosecutor must be certain that the evidence he relies on will be so accepted to be true in a court of law. This is the clear purport of the speeches in 
 Glinski 
`s case which was incorporated into the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
 Zainal 
`s case. Lord Denning said that the belief of the prosecutor is not that he honestly believed that the accused was guilty,
 
in truth he has only to be satisfied that there is a proper case to lay before the court ... After all, he cannot judge whether the witnesses are telling the truth. He cannot know what defences the accused may set up. Guilt or innocence is for the tribunal and not for him.
 
 
 
And Lord Devlin said that to have reasonable and probable cause
 
... does not mean that the prosecutor has to believe in the probability of conviction: 
Dawson v Cvandasseau
 
[1863] 11 WR 516
 , at p 518. The prosecutor has not got to test the full strength of the defence; he is concerned only with the question of whether there is a case fit to be tried.
 
 
 
To have reasonable and probable cause, therefore, (1) the prosecutor must have an honest belief that the place to be searched contains infringing goods; (2) this belief must be based on the full conviction that a state of circumstances exists; (3) this full conviction must be based on reasonable grounds; (4) assuming the state of circumstances exist in fact, a reasonable person in the prosecutor`s position would reasonably be led to the conclusion that the offence was probably committed.
An essential element of the offence under s 73 of the Act which was relied upon by the defendants in their application for the search warrants was, that the labels had to be counterfeit. Mr Rada`s argument was that the defendants did not have reasonable and probable cause because they did not have any credible evidence that could be relied on for the assertion that the labels were counterfeit. They had merely made a visual inspection of Challenger`s packaging and without attempting to ascertain the authenticity of the labels within, had reached their conclusions that an offence had been committed. It is not in dispute that the defendants did not send the labels for testing prior to the application before the magistrate for the search warrants. The question is whether notwithstanding the absence of such tests and on the basis of the visual inspection and the inferences drawn therefrom, they had reasonable and probable cause.
The defendants countered that they had such cause for the following reasons: (1) Avery had no dealings with the plaintiffs and yet their name was used on the packaging; (2) the repackaging made clear that Challenger was a registered trademark by ascribing `[trade ]` to it whereas no such thing was done in respect of Avery; (3) the representation of the Avery mark, the description of the products and the general quality of the repackaging were inconsistent with Avery`s corporate identity program and were sub-standard; (4) Avery had never experienced third parties buying their labels in bulk and repackaging them in smaller quantities; (5) Avery was unlikely to have authorised any repackaging of their labels since it maintained strict standards for its packaging in line with its corporate identity program. Furthermore, it already produced smaller quantity packages to cater for such demand; (6) both Liew and Gray were unaware of any instance of parallel imports of Avery`s products into Singapore.
An offence under s 73 of the Act as stated above, requires that the product within the packaging not originate from the owner of the mark. It is not made out simply because the packaging is not original or because the owner of the mark did not authorise the repackaging. Therefore, while I accept that there is some significance in the absence of authorisation from Avery or the fact that Challenger`s repackaging was so obviously not of Avery origin, the defendants` reliance on factors listed as (2), (3) and (5) above, should have been tempered by the realisation that Challenger could have repackaged original Avery labels and yet not be guilty of an offence under s 73 of the Act. I am therefore of the opinion that their relevance depended on the discounting of this realisation and that is in turn dependent on an assumption whose reasonableness I now examine.
This assumption was the perception that there had not been parallel importing of Avery labels. The question is therefore how reasonable this perception was. A primary reason for this perception was the belief that Avery had no dealings with Challenger. On hindsight, we know that Challenger obtained the labels from Columbia, its American subsidiary. Mr Yim argued that the sales to Columbia were never brought to the mind of Liew nor the American counsel and that the overlooking of this fact should not be taken against the defendants especially since Avery was a sizeable business organisation and therefore such information gaps are understandable. I do not think the size of an organisation is a valid excuse in this context, at any rate, not against a third party like Challenger. In Richard Randall`s letter dated 19 May 1993 to Leong (see para 20 above), it was acknowledged that Avery had sold their products to Columbia `with the knowledge that Columbia would re-sell in Singapore.` Whilst not dispositive of the issue, I am of the opinion that it somewhat undermines the reasonableness of the defendant`s position. Even if John Evans is to be believed in saying that he had not been told by Eric Ng (PW2) that the products would be sold by Challenger in Singapore, the fact remains that he knew that the products would find their way into the Singapore market. Therefore, even if it were true that the connection between Columbia and Challenger was not very obvious, I am of the view that Liew and Gray`s ignorance of any instance of parallel importing of Avery labels cannot be relied upon by the defendants.
In any event, I believed Eric Ng`s evidence that he had told John Evans (DW4) that Columbia was a sourcing company for Challenger. Central to this finding is the fact that Eric Ng was given the Avery distributor price list. Eric Ng`s testimony was that John Evans had told him that Avery was interested in finding a distributor for Avery products in Singapore. In cross-examination, Mr Yim attacked this evidence saying that at that time, Avery already had a distributor in Singapore and therefore it did not make any sense for them to court Challenger in this respect. However, apart from this suggestion by counsel, I was not provided with any further evidence to confirm this fact. In the absence of such evidence, I have to ask why a distributor price list would be provided to Eric Ng. The only reasonable inference is that Avery contemplated the possibility that he could link them up with a potential distributor in Singapore. This further leads to the inference, which I think perfectly reasonable, that John Evans must have been informed by Eric Ng that Columbia was a mere sourcing subsidiary for a large retailer in Singapore, Challenger.
The possibility that parallel importing had occurred, furthermore, should have been confirmed by the presence of Avery labels in their original packaging on sale at the Superstore and elsewhere. Liew said he saw these being sold at the Superstore. In his letter to Arthur Moore dated 21 April 1993, Leong highlighted this fact (see para 7 above).
In the light of these facts, I think that the plaintiffs have shown that the defendants should have been aware that original Avery labels had penetrated the Singapore market; they could not have reasonably dismissed this possibility. The next issue then is whether, notwithstanding this finding, Challenger`s breaking down of bulk quantities of labels into smaller quantities was so unexpected such that the defendants could legitimately discount the possibility. The defence witnesses testified that they had never experienced such an occurrence of bulk-breaking and I agree that this is one factor to be taken in favour of the defence. However, it is but one factor to be weighed against all the surrounding circumstances.
The plaintiffs, alive to the fact that this was the weakness in the defence, pressed the point that the defendants should have tested the authenticity of the labels before embarking on the application before the magistrate. The substance of Mr Yim`s case on this point was that firstly, the appearance of the Challenger repackaging was sufficient to constitute reasonable and probable cause without further action. Secondly, it was not reasonable to expect the defendants to carry out the tests in view of the imperative of expedience and the fact that testing itself would not be conclusive of the origin of the labels. On the first point, I have already attempted to show how a reasonable belief that an offence had been committed under s 73 of the Act had to take into account the possibility that original goods had been repackaged.
In relation to the second point, Mr Yim pointed out that the labels in question were not really a sophisticated product and could be easily replicated. Tests to determine its origin would be complicated and would involve analysis of its chemical composition, a process complicated by the fact that Avery did not manufacture the composite elements itself but procured it from third parties. This evidence was led to show that the testing process would be cumbersome and time-consuming and perhaps, ultimately futile. Against this background, Mr Yim argued that the defendants were concerned with the need to move quickly to protect their rights. He adduced evidence of a previous situation involving the LabelPro software where a failure to move quickly against suspected infringers resulted in the software pirates disappearing with the result that Avery failed to vindicate its rights.
Intellectual property piracy is an evil which is difficult to eradicate especially in products which are easily reproduced. The occurrence of so-called `fly-by-night operators` which pirate anything from computer software to musical recordings are endemic enough for the courts to be sensitive to the difficulties faced by the owners of intellectual property in policing their rights.
In the present case, it is to be noted firstly, that there was evidence from the defendants` own witnesses that the normal procedure in cases of suspected trade mark infringement was to make a trap purchase and send the product to the head office in the United States for testing. Gray testified to this effect (N/E 353); Liew said that he had purchased one of the suspected packages and had sent it to Arthur Moore to `examine and tell me if it is indeed our products` (N/E 479). Now there is some confusion as to when Liew sent this package for testing. In fact, Mr Yim disputed that he sent the packages at all. Liew initially said he sent one sample of the Challenger repackaged labels after purchasing them sometime in February or March 1993. He sent another one to Moore about two or three weeks later when Moore said he had not received the first package. After he sent the second package, Moore informed him that he had found the first package. The following is an extract from Liew`s cross-examination (N/E 481C):
 
 
Mr Rada: You sent the packaging and the labels asking for confirmation whether they were Avery products itself, so to that particular query, what was Arthur Moore`s response? 
 
Liew: Arthur Moore told me it has to go for some kind of test to find out ... so I assumed that, you know, it`s some kind of laboratory test ... maybe to test on the paper or the glue, I`m not certain.
  
 
 
Liew testified, however, that he did not receive the test results prior to the raid. He was nevertheless very sure that he did send to Arthur Moore two packages before the raid for confirmation that they were Avery products. The third package was sent, as stated in his affidavit, after the raid and upon Challenger threatening to sue Avery. Liew said that even though the packaging was so obviously different from the original, he still sent the samples for testing (N/E 486). Later on in re-examination, Liew agreed that the first time he discovered Challenger`s repackaged labels was in April 1993 (as stated in his affidavit) and therefore he could not have sent the two packages at issue to Moore in February or March (N/E 675). The state of the evidence at this point was such that there was a `window period` between Liew`s discovery of the labels around 20 April 1993 and 17 May 1993 when the raid was carried out. Contrary to the defendant`s case as found in their affidavits of evidence-in-chief, Liew`s testimony was clearly that two samples of the repackaging had been sent to Avery headquarters for testing before the raids. Mr Yim`s case was that no such package was sent until after the raid. He asked Liew if he had any courier receipts to show that he had sent a package earlier than this but Liew said he could not produce them at the time. He explained that it was probably a `lack of administration on our part in our Singapore office that we did not enclose a covering note` (N/E 690). Although Liew got the exact dates muddled up and although Arthur Moore`s evidence was that he had not received any package during the window period, I was convinced that Liew sent the labels prior to the raid which for some reason or other never got tested. In spite of Mr Yim`s endeavours to get him to correct his testimony, Liew remained firm that he had done so.
From this evidence I make the following observations: even if Liew had not sent the packages prior to the raid, he was convinced that this was the procedure. I do not think Liew`s perceived need to send the labels for testing was merely imagined but stemmed from his understanding of his company`s procedures when it came to such matters. I am further of the opinion that the need for testing is not only a prudent step but one which should be reasonably expected of the defendants in the circumstances. In view of the reasonable possibility, which turned out to be true, that Challenger procured genuine Avery labels and repackaged them, the assertion that the appearance of the packaging constitutes sufficient cause must fail. In my opinion, some attempt should have been made to ascertain the authenticity of the labels.
I was not convinced by the excuse that the testing process would have been time-consuming or a potentially futile exercise. Firstly, with nothing more than the appearance of the repackaging and the fact that Avery had never experienced such occurrences previously, how could there be sufficient cause? Secondly, Avery had never previously conducted such tests in relation to their label products (N/E 410). And yet Richard Randall would have us believe that it is `frequently very, very difficult to determine with absolute certainty` if the label is genuinely of Avery origin. `Frequent` in relation to what? While it is true that Randall explains the factors he relied on to explain why the testing process is complex and not capable of certainty, at best, his was but an educated guess.
In contrast, we have evidence that when the labels were ultimately sent for testing, the actual process took `several days but less than a week` (N/E 996). This was confirmed by the evidence - on 27 May 1993, Avery Headquarters wrote to R & D saying that they had not received the samples sent by R & D. Presumably, a new set of samples was dispatched immediately. Arthur Moore`s testimony was that the samples were sent to one TT Chen of Avery Corporation who co-ordinated the analysis of the labels. On the 2 June 1993, Moore faxed the test results to Singapore. That gave Chen about five days to conduct his tests without accounting for the time needed to send the packages to him and back. The actual testing would have been done within a shorter time.
Furthermore, Randall said the testing process was time-consuming because it required the sending of the suspected labels to their laboratories in the United States which would take a few days and then to undergo tests which would take another few days. The defendants assert that they had to move fast because `suspects would quickly cover their ground or cease their suspected activities if they knew we were going to take action against them.` And yet it is incontrovertible that, assuming Liew discovered the labels on 20 April 1993, it was almost a month later when he swore the complaint and applied for the search warrants. I accept Mr Yim`s contention that the court should be slow to impugn conduct which, with the benefit of hindsight, has become questionable. However, I am of the view that in the circumstances, the explanations by the defendants as to why they did not test the labels prior to applying for the search warrants were wholly inadequate.
As I have pointed out, the crux of the matter is whether there was reasonable cause to believe that the contents of the admittedly non-authentic Challenger repackaging were counterfeit labels. The foregoing has shown that there was no reasonable cause. In any event, it seemed to me that even if there was objective cause for such a belief, none of the dramatis personae on the defendants` side ever subjectively possessed such a belief. I formed the impression that there was a chain of assumptions that another person had considered the matter without anyone actually having done so. This can be seen from Liew`s cross-examination (N/E 526-527):
 
 
Mr Rada: So are you saying that up to the point when you went to pray for the search warrant, and called the press to generate publicity about the raid, you were sure it was a counterfeit product that Challenger was dealing in? 
 
Liew: I won`t say I was sure of the counterfeit products, but by virtue of the fact that my head office has contacted Mr Gilbert Leong to give him the green light to go ahead with the application of search warrant, I had the impression that, you know, they have already done what they need to do. 
 
Mr Rada: So, if any consequences happened, you don`t have to answer for it? 
 
Liew: Well, it`s not my duty to go and check the properties or the contents of the label because I won`t know how to do it. So my duty is to make sure that I send these samples to them, for them to check it out because they have a manufacturing facility there and if they come back and they say that we can go ahead, I would have thought they must have done their homework.
  
 
 
In fact, Liew testified that he left the entire decision-making process to Leong and Avery headquarters (N/E 594-595):
 
 
Mr Rada: ... did Gilbert [Leong] ever confirm, you know, before the raid as to whether the labels were genuine or counterfeit? 
 
Liew: It`s my opinion there, the fact that the head office gave him the instruction to go ahead with the raid amounts to confirmation that, you know, `It is something which is not ours`.
  
 
 
Richard Randall testified that he was not advised in March 1993 that for an offence under s 73 of the Act to be made out, the labels themselves had to be counterfeit. Moore testified to the same effect. Moore further said under cross-examination (N/E 960):
 
We never had a specific discussion with Rodyk & Davidson of whether Avery had to prove the labels were counterfeit, but it could be inferred from the correspondence that the conclusion had been drawn that they were not our labels.
 
 
 
 
Mr Rada: Who drew that conclusion, Mr Moore, that the labels were counterfeit? 
 
Moore: It appears to me that it was primarily Mr Liew, together with whoever he may have consulted, but it was not based on consultation with us.
  
 
 
Later on, in re-examination, in response to Mr Yim`s question whether he had any doubt as to the authenticity of the labels when action was being planned against Challenger, Moore said that he had none and `accepted the conclusion that had been drawn in Singapore that the product was not genuine` (N/E 1022).
The third party concerned is Leong (DW7), who was at the material time the Singapore intellectual property counsel for Avery. He testified that his firm`s practice was to let the client confirm that the product in question was counterfeit. I refer to the following extract from his cross-examination (N/E 789):
 
 
Mr Rada: So didn`t that put you on notice that you needed to do something more to ascertain that the labels in P3, you know, had to be confirmed that they were not Avery labels? 
 
Leong: I mentioned earlier that we take our clients` confirmation as to the nature of the products and that we are not in the position to verify the same. The visual inspection which I carried out was essentially for my benefit and that I took my client`s instruction that they were not the same.
  
 
 
So the picture that emerges is that when he was asked to swear the complaint, Liew thought his headquarters in the United States had ascertained that the labels were counterfeit which was why they gave the go-ahead to Leong by their letter dated 23 April 1993. In turn, Moore and Randall in the United States simply accepted Liew`s and Leong`s confirmation that an offence had been made out. Leong himself was under the impression that the labels were counterfeit based on what Liew had told him. In my view, the law requires the defendant to have reasonable and probable cause and this not only means that such cause objectively exists but that it was subjectively held by him; I think the plaintiffs have shown that this was not so in the present case.
Mr Yim submitted that the real issue was whether Liew, as employee of the defendants and complainant, had no reasonable and probable cause. He implied that Liew`s actions should be viewed separately from those of ADC, R & D and the private investigators. As long as a reasonable layman in his position would have acted as he did, that was reasonable and probable cause. In my opinion, that suggestion was unmeritorious. The defendants have conducted their case without distinguishing between their local and American offices. Although the defendants are the local subsidiary of ADC and therefore legally distinct, it was quite clear that at all relevant times, ADC and DTC acted as one organ with Moore and Randall taking a hands-on approach to the Challenger case.
The defendants raised another interesting point which in my view pertains to the issue of reasonable and probable cause. That argument is premised on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The application for a search warrant was made under s 62 thereof which empowers the magistrate to issue a search warrant if 
 
... upon information and after such inquiry as it thinks necessary has reason to believe that any place is used -
 
 
 
 
(a) for the deposit or sale ... of goods in respect of which an offence has been committed under sections 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74 of the Trade Marks Act.
  
 
 
Mr Yim`s argument, if I understood him correctly, was that the section casts a burden on the magistrate to make due inquiries. By allowing the application, the magistrate has satisfied himself that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the offence has been committed. The person laying the information before the magistrate is only required to place before the court information that is inherently credible. If he does that, the interposition of the magistrate`s actions is an answer to a claim for malicious prosecution.
In support of this position, Mr Yim cited several old English cases. In 
Leigh v Webb
 
[1800] 3 Esp 165
 , the plaintiff brought a claim for malicious prosecution against the defendant who, having the suspicion that the plaintiff had stolen his property, had procured the latter`s imprisonment without probable cause. Lord Eldon ordered that the plaintiff be nonsuited and said (at pp 166-167):
 
The defendant having lost his property, states the facts to the magistrate upon which he is to form his judgment. If the highest criminal judge of the land was, by mistake of judgment, to conceive that to be felony which did not amount to that offence, and to commit the party complained against, would that subject the party complaining to an action of this sort? I am of opinion it ought not, and that the plaintiff must be nonsuited.
 
 
 
The next case relied upon by Mr Yim is 
Hope v Evered
 
[1886] 17 QBD 338
 , a decision of Lord Coleridge CJ. The case concerned the issue of a search warrant under the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which provided:if it appears to any justice of the peace, on information made before him on oath by any parent, relative, or guardian of any woman or girl, by any other person who, in the opinion of the justice is bona fide acting in the interest of any woman or girl, that there is reasonable cause to suspect that such woman or girl is unlawfully detained for immoral purposes by any person in any place within the jurisdiction of such justice, such justice may issue a warrant authorizing any person named therein to search for ... such woman or girl.
The learned Chief Justice said:
 
The Act of Parliament therefore casts on the magistrate (and if legislation of this nature is to be effective, most properly so) the onus of its being made to appear to him that there is reasonable cause that the girl is being detained for immoral purposes. If the person who puts the magistrate in action only states the grounds of his suspicion and says that on those grounds he reasonably suspects that the girl is improperly detained, and if the magistrate agrees with him and thinks that it has been made to appear to him that a person acting bona fide has reasonable cause for his suspicion, then that decision of the magistrate is an answer to such an action as the present.
 
 
 
The magistrate`s action was therefore, in Coleridge CJ`s view, a complete answer to a claim for malicious prosecution save for the following exception (at p 340): 
 
I do not, however, suggest for an instant that this action would not lie against a person who, desiring to use the powers given by this Act for purposes of oppression, and knowing that he had no reasonable cause for suspicion, in a false and fraudulent manner obtained the issue of a search warrant; 
 but where bona fides is present, and the matter is stated fully and fairly to the magistrate
 and he concludes that there is reasonable ground for the applicant`s suspicion, then his conclusion is an answer to any proceedings. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
Lea v Charrington
 
[1889] 23 QBD 45
 , the Queen`s Bench Division followed 
 Hope v Evered 
 in a case involving the same statute. However, it is to be noted that the Court of Appeal upheld the Queen`s Bench Division on the facts but declined to express an opinion on the correctness of 
 Hope 
`s case.
Coleridge CJ`s judgment in 
 Hope v Evered 
 is not without its difficulties. The exception to the defence he upheld suggests that there are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order that a defendant can rely on the magistrate`s action. Firstly, his initiation of proceedings must be bona fide. Secondly, all relevant information must be before the magistrate. The distinction between a lack of bona fides as used by his lordship and malice is, in my opinion, difficult to apply and probably best discarded. That being the case, all Lord Coleridge would then be saying is that you cannot succeed in a claim for malicious prosecution without showing malice which, with respect, is tautologous. To be fair, in England, the question of reasonable and probable cause is for the judge. If there is a want of such cause, the matter of malice then goes to the jury. Lord Coleridge was pronouncing on the question of reasonable and probable cause and his remarks can be arguably confined to that issue. Nevertheless, I think the decision in 
 Hope v Evered 
, insofar as it purports to say what Mr Yim says it does, is inherently contradictory and difficult to defend in principle.
For present purposes, however, let us assume that the case stands for the proposition that the magistrate`s interposition is a good defence in a claim for malicious prosecution in that the plaintiff cannot then show a want of reasonable and probable cause. In effect, this would render the tort of maliciously procuring a search warrant otiose when cases decided as recently as 1984 have recognised its existence (see 
 Reynolds 
` case, supra). Plainly, the cases recognising the tort are inconsistent in principle with 
 Hope v Evered 
. Furthermore, it will deprive the plaintiff of a remedy even if there has been a want of reasonable and probable cause and malice, that is, if the requirement of malice does not equate with Lord Coleridge`s first condition. In my view, the interposition of the magistrate`s act of issuing the search warrant does not absolve the defendant from requiring reasonable and probable cause on his own part. Insofar as the authorities cited state the opposite, I am of the opinion they go too far.
In my view, the magistrate`s action can be a factor to be taken into account to support the defendants` action in the sense that on the facts, he concluded that an offence had been made out. However, this would depend on whether the magistrate has before him all the relevant information as the defendants. The onus is on the complainant to produce such information. I think commonsense and the authorities support that position. Lord Eldon noted that the defendant in 
 Leigh v Webb 
 had stated the facts to the magistrate. Lord Coleridge in 
 Hope v Evered 
, as noted above, similarly envisaged that the magistrate`s act would be an answer to the claim for malicious prosecution only where the complainant puts the facts before the magistrate and the latter`s action is premised on those grounds. It is plain that on the present facts, all the relevant facts were not before the magistrate. In particular, the following statement ostensibly suggested that the labels were conclusively counterfeit:
 
Upon examining the box of computer labels, I confirmed that it was not an original product manufactured by my parent company or its branches or with its consent or license.
 
 
 
This was plainly not the case and whether out of inadvertence or out of malice (a matter I will consider shortly), the complaint did not disclose all the information that would be relevant for the magistrate`s consideration.
 Malice
We turn next to the issue of malice which is a common element in the claims of malicious prosecution and malicious falsehood. The prosecution must prove that the defendants were motivated by spite, ill-will or some improper or indirect motives. The prosecutor must be shown to have embarked on the prosecution with the aim of securing some end other than to bring the plaintiff to justice for committing the specified offence.
Mr Rada argued that the defendants wanted publicity for their products and wanted to send a message to the other infringers in the marketplace. A related motive was to ensure that there were no obstacles in the way of the official launch of Avery products in Singapore. Liew agreed with Mr Rada under cross examination that one of the reasons for having reporters cover the raids was because there would be favourable publicity for Avery products. Concerning the deterrence motive, I accept the thrust of Liew`s evidence that such publicity would tell the public that Avery was serious about protecting its intellectual property rights. It would have a deterrent effect on retailers dealing in infringing products thus protecting the reputation of the company and its products and ensuring that sales would not be affected when the products were officially launched (N/E 528). I am unable to agree with Mr Rada, however, that these were improper motives. Section 73 of the Act exists to protect intellectual property rights. In my view, the defendants` hope that their action deter other infringers was consistent with the desire to protect these rights.
As for the contention that the defendants wanted the raids to give positive publicity for their range of products, I was sceptical whether the publicity so garnered would be more than minimal. Furthermore, the plaintiffs relied on a letter by Arthur Moore to Frank Rexach of the Office Products Group at Avery Dennison which discussed the legal action planned in relation to the LabelPro infringements where Moore had written:
 
An underlying business strategy could be to co-ordinate the bringing of the action(s) with Avery Dennison`s launch of LabelPro in Singapore. The legal action might provide favorable publicity to support the launch.
 
 
 
I do not think that this consideration played more than an ancillary role in the decision to take action against Challenger. It is mentioned once in a letter relating to the LabelPro software about one month before Liew`s discovery of the repackaged Avery labels. Liew`s testimony was that while this was one reason why the defendants took action against Challenger, the more important reason was to protect its intellectual property rights (N/E 529). Also, there was no evidence that news of the raid was co-ordinated with the launch in any systematic fashion which would suggest a preconceived plan to exploit the raid`s publicity potential.
Mr Rada also contended that the defendants were motivated by the cost factor. They were not willing to bear the costs of admittedly more expensive civil litigation and therefore went for the cheaper option. Mr Rada pointed to various letters in which this concern was highlighted by the various personalities in the Avery set up. I accept that this concern played a part in the decision to go ahead with the application for the search warrants. However, I do not think that this necessarily leads to a finding of malice. If the defendants genuinely believed that there was a case against Challenger, they were entitled to choose the avenue of action that best suited their interests without their action being considered malicious.
Mr Rada`s next point was that the complaint Liew swore before the magistrate deliberately omitted information which if disclosed, may have resulted in the magistrate refusing the warrant or asking for confirmatory evidence. Suppression of information, he submitted, is tantamount to malice. I accept Mr Rada`s proposition as a matter of principle but I am unable to agree with him that Liew deliberately suppressed information in his complaint. Mr Rada himself points out that the complaint was drafted by private investigators. I think that if Liew believed that there was a good case against Challenger and placed the process in the hands of the professionals Avery engaged, how the complaint was drafted is not evidence of malice.
The nub of the matter, it seems to me is, whether the defendants had a genuine belief that there was a bona fide case against the plaintiffs based on s 73 of the Act and were primarily motivated by a desire to vindicate their proprietary rights. The absence of reasonable and probable cause does not lead inexorably to a finding that there was malice. In the present case, while the defendants` belief that the labels were counterfeit were based on objectively unjustifiable grounds, that does not mean that they did not subjectively honestly believe in there being a case against the plaintiffs. In 
Brown v Hawkes
 
[1891] 2 QB 718
 , the defendant had reported the plaintiff for some boots the latter had taken from him without payment. The plaintiff was subsequently arrested and brought before the magistrates and discharged. He sued the defendant for damages for malicious prosecution. The county court found for the plaintiff. On appeal to the High Court (Cave and AL Smith JJ), the court was divided with the result that the appeal was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal (Lord Escher MR and Bowen LJ) unanimously allowed the appeal. Cave J, who would have allowed the appeal from the county court and whom the Court of Appeal agreed with, held that since the jury had found that the defendant had a honest belief in the charge he laid before the magistrates, there was no basis upon which they could have made the other finding that the defendant was actuated by malice. This was even where there was a want of reasonable and probable cause in laying the charge. Cave J held (at p 723):
 
Of course, there may be such plain want of reasonable and probable cause that the jury may come to the conclusion that the prosecutor could not honestly have believed in the charge he made, and in that case want of reasonable and probable cause is evidence of malice. But I am not prepared to assent to the proposition that, where there is want of reasonable and probable cause, the jury may always find malice, no matter what the circumstances may be.
 
 
 
In my view, I am more than satisfied that the defendants had an honest belief that there was a case against Challenger notwithstanding the lack of reasonable and probable cause. Mr Yim argued that the Challenger`s retail business was complementary to the defendants` manufacturing and distribution business. He argued that the defendants had no reason to injure the interests of Challenger except in the course of legitimately defending their rights; I tend to agree. There is no evidence that Challenger was specifically targeted by the defendants nor is there any evidence why it should have been so targeted. Furthermore, while I have found a lack of reasonable and probable cause in the application for the search warrants, that can be attributed to the internal and, in my view, negligent mishandling of the situation by the defendants` personnel and not to any malicious intent.
One troubling aspect of the case was the fact that when the parties appeared before Lai Kew Chai J for the hearing of the motion to quash the search warrants, the defendants did not disclose AB96A in which Richard Randall acknowledged that Avery had sold the labels indirectly to Challenger and that the repackaged labels were most likely to be genuine. Mr Rada argued that had this document been disclosed to Lai Kew Chai J, the proceedings could have terminated at a much earlier stage. He argued that this non-disclosure was evidence of malice. Leong, under cross-examination, could not really explain why he had not included AB96A in the documents presented before Lai Kew Chai J.
I am of the opinion that Leong should have disclosed AB96A at the hearing of the motion; his omission to do so is inexcusable. Nevertheless, the question still remains whether that failure can support a finding of malice. It is to be noted that the relevance of the document in the circumstances was the acknowledgement that the labels were likely to be genuine. Examining the affidavit evidence before Lai Kew Chai J, it was unarguable that the defendants took the position that the labels were genuine. In Liew`s affidavit dated 3 August 1993, he said (at para 9),
 
... samples of the seized goods were sent to Avery`s offices in the United States to ascertain the veracity of the claims made by Challenger [that the labels were genuine]. The seized goods have since been returned to Challenger (AB242-6).
 
 
 
In fact, the defendants in the course of the proceedings before Lai Kew Chai J had taken the position that Challenger had falsely applied a registered trade mark to the labels, an offence under s 73 of the Act. Some background is perhaps called for. Section 73 sets out two types of offences, namely dealings in goods to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied and dealings in goods to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied. An essential ingredient of the former offence is that the goods themselves must be counterfeit (see 
Ng Chye Mong v PP
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 150
  ; 
[1988] SLR 299
) and this was accepted by counsel at the hearing of the motion. The defendants defended the motion, inter alia, on the basis that they had grounds to believe that the latter offence had been committed. This in turn raised the question whether the labels had to be counterfeit which the defendants contended was not a requirement. In effect, the defendants took the position that the labels were genuine and the only issue was the interpretation of the legislation enacting the offence. Lai Kew Chai J`s written grounds of judgment was in effect a pronouncement on this controversy. I am therefore unable to place too much emphasis on the non-disclosure of AB96A insofar as it supports the plaintiff`s claim that there was malice.
 Malicious falsehood
We move then to the plaintiffs` next claim. In order to succeed, the plaintiffs must show that the defendants maliciously published words about Challenger that were false and special damage has followed as a direct and natural result of the publication (see 
Kaye v Robertson
 
[1991] FSR 62
 per Glidewell LJ at p 67).
The specific instances of malicious falsehood that the plaintiffs rely on are the words of Liew in the complaint sworn before the magistrate as well as certain portions of the two newspaper articles that followed the raid which the plaintiffs allege originated from the defendants.
Concerning the newspaper articles, Mr Rada`s case was that the falsehood was what Liew had told the reporters and not the articles per se which were only evidence of the falsehoods told. He said that the articles show that Liew had impressed on the reporters that the labels were fake either by using that word or words to that effect. As regards the first element of the tort which is that falsehoods in the newspaper articles originated from the defendants, I am of the opinion that it has not been established that the falsehoods originated from the defendants. Both articles contained sloppy inaccuracies which could not have been faithful reproductions of what the reporter had been told. Teo from the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
 reported the turnover of the Avery Group as $60 million when it was closer to $2 billion, a fact which I do not think Liew would have got wrong. Leo from the 
 Business Times 
 said in evidence that he was told the turnover was $27 million. Two hundred and twenty nine boxes of labels containing about 500 labels each were seized from Challenger. Leo`s report says that three hundred labels were seized. While I am aware that these are details which have no direct bearing on the real issue which is whether the reporters were told in unqualified terms that Challenger was dealing in fakes, I think they do not reflect well on the standard of accuracy in the two reports.
What has a direct bearing is the fact that the two reporters could not confirm that Liew had used the term `fake`. Liew`s evidence was that he would not have used that word or words similar in meaning unqualified. He stressed that he would not have said something definite if he was not sure about it (N/E 550). I think that this is borne out from the evidence given by the two reporters. Leo testified that in writing the article, he relied on the contemporaneous notes he took down in his conversations with Liew during and after the raid. These notes were subsequently admitted in evidence (see P5). It was quite clear that in these notes, the word `fake` did not appear at all. Indeed, in the notes, there is no reference to counterfeiting at all. I think if Liew had used words to this effect, Leo would have written them down. Leo himself admitted as much (N/E 226). As for Teo, the main text of his article in Mandarin did not contain any statements that the plaintiffs could take issue with. The caption under the photo accompanying the article read however 
 
On the shelves of a software shop in Funan Centre are displayed genuine Avery Dennison`s products on one side (with colour) and 
 fake
 products with Avery Dennison`s trademark on the other (only blue and white colours). [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Teo further confirmed that Liew `might not have used the word ""fake""` (N/E 262). He was however of the impression that this was a case of piracy although he admitted that this was his own description of the case. I also think it telling that he said that he was not able to recall Liew using any `conclusive` words like `piracy` or `pirated`.
The burden of proof is on the plaintiffs. The tort of malicious falsehood is predicated on there having been a falsehood published. It is true that the falsehood need not be in writing but can be oral. However, it must be shown that there has been such a falsehood orally made. In view of the evidence before me, I find that there is insufficient evidence to make the finding the plaintiffs contended.
With regards to the complaint, the only statement which I accept is inaccurate is that in which Liew says that he examined the box of labels and confirmed that it was not an original product and the last line of the complaint where he describes the labels as `counterfeit ""Avery"" products`. The other instances of alleged falsehood which the plaintiffs cite are, in my opinion, qualified by the words `believed to be` and `reasonable cause to suspect`. Mr Yim argues that the complaint must be looked at in its entirety and that would show that the portions complained of were drafted carelessly and not a deliberate attempt to cause harm to the plaintiffs; I accept this submission.
At any rate, I do not think there was malice in the making of any of the statements. Mr Rada took the position that this was made out on the same grounds as he relied on in relation to malicious prosecution. I find that there was no malice for the same reasons I gave in relation to that head of damage.
 Trespass
The plaintiffs claim damages for trespass to their property as well as to their goods. The gist of their argument is, that the search warrants under which the raiding party entered Challenger`s premises and seized the suspected infringing goods were subsequently quashed by the order of Lai Kew Chai J. A quashed search warrant is void ab initio. It is as if the warrant had never been issued. The defendants therefore did not have any lawful authority to conduct the search or seize the goods.
Counsel for the defendants argued that the plaintiffs were relying on the doctrine of `relation back` ie that an act initially lawful is rendered unlawful ab initio if a higher authority reverses the act. They argued that this archaic doctrine was no longer good law and relied on Lord Denning MR`s judgment in 
Wiltshire v Barret
 
[1966] 1 QB 612
 . In my opinion, this argument was misconceived. The plaintiffs` argument, in my view, was that the search warrants themselves were unlawful in view of Lai Kew Chai J`s decision. There was no question of it being initially lawful and then rendered unlawful by some subsequent event as in 
Chic Fashions v Jones
 
[1968] 2 QB 299
 and 
 Wiltshire v Barret 
.
I looked at other authorities which considered claims in false imprisonment and trespass in respect of arrest warrants and other court orders which purport to entitle the applicant to enter premises or distrain goods. In 
 Codrington v Lloyd 
 (1839) 8 Ad & El 459, the defendant was retained by F whom the plaintiff was indebted to recover the debt. The defendant obtained a writ against the plaintiff which directed the Sheriff to arrest the plaintiff. The Sheriff executed the writ and the plaintiff was subsequently arrested and imprisoned. The writ was subsequently set aside for irregularity. The plaintiff brought an action for trespass and false imprisonment against F`s attorney, the defendant. The court gave judgment for the plaintiff and held that the setting aside of the writ was as if it never existed and the defendant or his principal could not therefore justify their actions under it. In a similar case, 
Parsons v Loyd
 
[1772] 3 Wils KB 341
 , Lord Chief Justice de Grey held (at p 345):
 
There is a great difference between erroneous process, and irregular (that is to say void) process, the first stands valid and good until it be reversed, the latter is an absolute nullity from the beginning; the party may justify under the first until it be reversed; but he cannot justify under the latter, because it was his own fault that it was irregular and void at first.
 
 
 
In 
Williams v George Smith
 
[1863] 14 CBNS 596
 , an order was made by the Master of the Rolls requiring the plaintiff Smith, who was the former solicitor of one Ann Casse, to hand over to the newly appointed solicitor, all papers and documents in his possession, custody or power relating to certain suits. Certain documents were however being held by the law stationer, who had a lien over them in respect of his unpaid copying bill and the plaintiff himself claimed a lien over unpaid fees. He therefore did not comply with the order. The newly appointed solicitor swore an affidavit applying for an order of attachment alleging non-compliance with the order but failed to mention the excuse of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was subsequently detained under the order of detachment issued by the Master of the Rolls. An application to set aside the order of attachment was dismissed by the Master of the Rolls but on appeal, this order was reversed by the Lords Justices who ordered that the writ be set aside and the plaintiff discharged from custody. The plaintiff thereafter brought an action in tort for damages. His argument was that the order of attachment was set aside by a higher court and therefore, it was as if it never existed. The defendants could therefore not justify under it. The court (Erle CJ, Williams, Willes and Byles JJ) dismissed the claim. Erle CJ held that there was a distinction between proceedings being set aside for irregularity and the reversal of an erroneous decision by a higher court. He said (at p 621):
 
Now, it is agreed upon all hands that, if the proceedings had been set aside for irregularity, for the violation of any rule of practice, Smith would have been liable, and that, if the attorney be liable, as a general rule, the party employing him would be liable also. But here the affidavit was such as the clerk was bound to accept. There was nothing on the face of the proceeding to make it irregular.
 
 
 
... Upon appeal, the Lords Justices were of opinion that the Master of the Rolls came to an erroneous conclusion, and they reversed his decision. They thought that if, in consequence of the failure of the client to make advances which she had undertaken to make, the papers became charged with a lien, it is a strong thing to say that the attorney was guilty of contempt for not delivering up papers which were placed beyond his control through no fault of his own. That is a totally different thing from setting aside the attachment for irregularity in the proceedings. ... In 
 Cooper v Lewis
 2 Phillips 178, it was held by Lord Cottenham that, if a petition for an ex parte order suppresses any fact which, whether really material or not, would, if communicated to the officer whose duty it is to draw up the order, prevent him from doing so without mentioning the matter to the court, the order will be discharged for irregularity. There, the party obtained the court by suppressing a fact which it was his duty to mention: and the court held that the order had been obtained irregularly, by reason of that concealment. It is immaterial whether it be called an irregularity or anything else. But there is this distinction between that case and the present, viz. That there the fact suppressed was a material fact, and the order would not have been granted if it had been communicated to the officer.
 
 
 
In the same case, Williams J, concurring with Erle CJ, held (at p 622):
 
If the attachment in this case had been set aside on the ground of irregularity or that it was issued in bad faith, or in any other way equivalent to irregularity, I should have thought that both the attorney and the client would be liable for any imprisonment which took place under it. But, upon the facts which appeared at the trial, it is not true that the attachment was set aside for irregularity or on the ground that it was issued in bad faith.
 
 
 
Willes J held (at p 623):
 
It by no means follows that because a writ or an attachment is set aside, an action for false imprisonment lies against those who procured it to be issued. If that were so, this absurd consequence would follow, that every person concerned in enforcing the execution of a judgment would be held responsible for its correctness. Where an execution is set aside on the ground of an erroneous judgment, the plaintiff or his attorney is no more liable to an action than the sheriff who executes the process is. ... I entirely agree with what has been laid down by my Lord and my Brother Williams that, in order to entitle the party against whom the process issues to maintain an action for any intermediate acts done under it, he must shew that the process has been set aside by reason of some misconduct, or at least some irregularity, on the part the person suing it out. It has been contended here, that the attachment was set aside for misconduct or irregularity - that Smith was guilty of a fraudulent suppression of facts in the affidavit upon which he procured the attachment to be issued, and that it was upon that ground that the Lords Justices ordered it to be set aside. That is simply contrary to the fact.
 
 
 
In my view, underlying the authorities is a tension between two competing interests. On the one hand, there are the interests of the plaintiffs, who have been dragged through court proceedings unnecessarily. Some sympathy for them is natural. On the other hand, there is the equally weighty consideration that the law should not discourage recourse to the law to protect legitimate legal rights. I think this is supported by two local authorities relating to the law of distress. In 
Chop Chye Hin Chong v Ng Yeok Seng
 
 [1934] MLJ 265 
 , an action was brought in which the plaintiff claimed damages against the defendant for wrongful seizure of goods under a writ of distress which had been set aside on the ground that it was in respect of two months` arrears when this was untrue and only one month`s arrears was due. The district judge gave judgment for the plaintiff despite holding that there was no malice on the defendant`s part. On appeal, Shaw CJ, allowing the appeal, held (at p 266):
 
It is a well established principle both with regard to civil and criminal matters that a person is not liable in damages for putting the law in motion unless he is actuated by malice. It is the right of everyone to put the law in motion if he does so with the honest intention of protecting his interests but it is an abuse of that right if he proceeds maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause for anticipating success. An example of this will be found in the difference that exists between an action for wrongful arrest and one for malicious prosecution in the case of the first, where a man acts on his own initiative, proof of malice is not necessary to give a right to recompense by damages. In the case of the second, where the interposition of the court is obtained, malice must be established. An example may again be found in the form of an action for abuse of ordinary civil process. Malice and absence of reasonable and probable cause must again be proved in the same manner as in an action for malicious prosecution (
 Mitchell v Jenkins
 5 B & Ad 588). The case of wrongfully obtaining the issue of a writ of extent in England is perhaps as closely analogous to wrongfully obtaining the issue of a distress warrant under our law as can possibly be obtained. Authority to issue such a writ, which is a special remedy for the recovery of Crown debts, is obtained on application to the court on affidavit very similar to the application for a distress warrant under our Civil Procedure Code. Although damages may be obtained for maliciously issuing such writ, (see
 Craig v Hasell
 4 QB 481) damages cannot be recovered for the mere wrongful issue of the writ without malice (see 
 Pridgeon v Mellor
 28 TLR 261), the reason being, as stated in the latter case, that there is a judicial determination interposed between filing of the affidavit on which the writ is issued and the issue of the writ, and the issue of the writ is in consequence of that interposition and therefore persons acting without malice are protected.
 
 
 
An example of the same principle will be found amongst the decision of the courts of this colony in the case of 
 Surinam v Letchimee
 11 SSLR 87 where it was held that damages cannot be recovered for unlawfully seizing goods in execution after an order of the court interpleader summons.
 
 
 
The district judge having found that there was no malice in the present case, the defendant was entitled to have the plaintiff`s claim dismissed.
 
 
 
In 
Ginsin Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Khoon t/a Chan Eng Soon Service & Anor
 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 553
  , Judith Prakash J followed the reasoning in 
 Chop Chye Hin Chong 
 and dismissed a claim for damages for trespass in respect of a illegal distress because the plaintiffs had not shown malice.
The facts of those cases admittedly do not concern search warrants. However, I think the general principle identified by Shaw CJ is applicable to the present case. Following the tenor of the authorities cited above, it seems to me that the plaintiffs in the present case can only succeed in trespass if they can show that the search warrant was on its face irregular or if the defendants had obtained that warrant through some misconduct such as malice or fraud. When one examines Lai Kew Chai J`s judgment, it seems to me quite clear that he based his decision to quash the warrants not on any irregularity or misconduct in the proceedings which led to the learned magistrate issuing the search warrant. In my view, he was determining the issue on the basis of the facts before him at that point of time. At p 453H, he says: 
 
The applicants in this case, though having failed to obtain the assent of Avery Dennison Corporation, have at every stage proved that they dealt with genuine goods (see paras 10-13 of the first affidavit of Mr Loo). I would hold that no offence has been committed under s 73 of the Act and accordingly, the complaint is dismissed and the search warrant is quashed.
 
 
 
Paragraphs 10 to 13 of Loo`s affidavit referred to by the learned judge related to matters which the persons applying for the search warrant and the magistrate issuing the warrant were not aware of. There was no fraudulent suppression of these facts on their part. In the circumstances, I do not think that the word `quash` can be too rigidly applied in its administrative law sense to make the order void ab initio. In truth, what Lai Kew Chai J did was not to strike down the magistrate`s order. He was merely discharging it after a consideration of all the evidence and submissions of law, some of which were not, and indeed could not reasonably be expected to be, before the learned magistrate. In my judgment, the defendants can justify their actions under the search warrants even though it was subsequently set aside by Lai Kew Chai J. The claim in trespass accordingly fails.
 Conclusion
Consequently, I give judgment for the defendants. Before dealing with the issue of costs, I need to first refer to the costs of proceedings in the motion. Mr Yim had submitted (N/E 1174) that the plaintiffs should not be allowed to claim their costs for the motion in this suit as, they did not address the issue of costs in their arguments before Lai Kew Chai J; even if Lai Kew Chai J had reserved his decision, the plaintiffs could have gone back to court to present their arguments on costs after he had delivered his judgment. Mr Rada explained (N/E 1331) that the omission was due to no fault of the plaintiffs - the parties were not told by the registry to receive Lai Kew Chai J`s judgment when it was released. Instead, thinking it was a criminal matter, the judgment was handed to the criminal registry which did not inform the parties; the plaintiffs only came to know of Lai Kew Chai J`s decision when it was published in the law reports. The plaintiffs therefore claimed as special damages, sums totalling $20,836 (AB293-294) for the legal fees they incurred for the motion.
If the plaintiffs had had the opportunity to present their submissions on costs for the motion, I am certain they would have been awarded the same, bearing in mind that the hearing of the motion would have been concluded sooner and undoubtedly in the plaintiffs` favour had the learned judge been apprised of the existence of AB96A. In the light of my finding that the defendants did not have reasonable and probable cause in applying for the search warrants, as well as taking all the other circumstances of the case into consideration, I am of the opinion that responsibility for this unfortunate litigation must be largely attributed to the defendants. I therefore make no order for costs for these proceedings save that the plaintiffs shall bear the court fees and the defendants shall be allowed their full disbursements.",1997-07-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court):
The appellant was convicted on a charge under s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) of trafficking by transporting six packets of heroin containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine in taxi SH 2894G from Bishan Street 22 to Ophir Road between 11.45am and 12noon on 19 July 1996. He was sentenced to death. We heard his appeal on 17 March 1997 which we dismissed without calling on the deputy public prosecutor. We now give our reasons.
The facts are not in dispute. In fact the appellant admitted at the trial that when he was arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers at Ophir Road, he was in possession of a black carrier bag which contained a white nylon sack, inside which were six packets of heroin, which were later found to contain 294.5g of diamorphine, the subject matter of the charge. However, he maintained, as will be seen later, that until he had examined the contents of the six packets in the taxi on his way back to People`s Park Complex, he believed he was carrying spare parts for his friend, one Ah Poh. On making this discovery he had panicked and had immediately re-directed the taxi driver to Golden Mile Complex at Beach Road where he hoped to find Ah Poh and confront him. It was then that the CNB officers, who were trailing him, had stopped the taxi at Ophir Road and arrested him. Accordingly, his defence was that he was an innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin.
The appellant had arrived at Bishan Street 22 in taxi SH 2894G from People`s Park Complex where he lived at about 11.40am. At Bishan Street 22 the appellant had directed the taxi driver to proceed to the car park at Block 253 and wait for him whilst the appellant alighted saying he would return shortly. He did return shortly and directed the taxi driver to take him to a coffeeshop at another car park in the vicinity. He had already arranged with the taxi driver to hire his taxi for the next two to three hours. At the second car park the taxi driver went to the coffeeshop for coffee and saw the appellant also taking coffee there. After taking his coffee the taxi driver returned to his taxi to wait for the appellant. After a while the appellant joined him carrying a black carrier bag. He directed the taxi driver to return to the car park at Block 253, where he left the taxi saying he would return in a while. He left the black carrier bag in the taxi. A short while later the appellant returned to the taxi carrying a white nylon sack. He got in and told the taxi driver to take him back to People`s Park Complex.
The foregoing is a digest of the taxi driver`s evidence at the trial.
The appellant`s arrival at the car park at Block 253, Bishan Street 22 was witnessed by a team of four CNB officers. They had arrived there shortly before 11am. They were acting on information received. Their target was Block 253. Immediately on arrival they had surveyed Block 253 and had seen a cardboard box on the staircase landing between levels three and four. The box was approximately one foot square. It was sealed with yellow masking tape. The four CNB officers positioned themselves strategically so that one or two amongst them could observe the car park beside Block 253 and the void deck at the ground level while the others could observe the movements of anyone going to the cardboard box. They were in `walkie-talkie` contact with each other.
At about 11.40am one of the CNB officers spotted the appellant at the void deck of Block 253 talking to someone on his mobile phone. The other CNB officers were immediately alerted. The sum total of the CNB officers` evidence was that the appellant was seen going up the staircase to the landing where the cardboard box was and returning to the taxi carrying what was later identified as the white nylon sack. One of the CNB officers also testified that she had trailed the appellant and whilst she was at the staircase landing between the second and third levels of Block 253, she had heard the sound of paper being torn coming from the level above. It will be remembered that the cardboard box was on the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253. After the appellant had left in the taxi the cardboard box was found opened and empty.
The route taken by the taxi driver to return to People`s Park Complex from Bishan Street 22 was Bishan Road, Braddell Road and onto the Central Expressway to the City. However, when they were on the Central Expressway the appellant directed the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex in Beach Road instead. The taxi driver in his evidence said that he then turned off the Central Expressway into Bukit Timah Road and was proceeding along Ophir Road when he had to slow down in the traffic between Queen Street and Johore Road. It was then that the CNB officers who had been trailing the taxi since it left Bishan Street 22 boarded the taxi and arrested the appellant.
The appellant was seated in the rear seat of the taxi. He had with him the black carrier bag referred to earlier. This was seized by Inspector Chow Toong Chee (Insp Chow), who was following the CNB car trailing the taxi. Insp Chow asked the appellant what he had in the black carrier bag. The appellant answered that he had six bundles of white powder. The questions and answers were in the Hokkien dialect and duly recorded by Insp Chow and initialled by the appellant. After that Insp Chow unzipped the black carrier bag and took out the white nylon sack which was inside it. The white nylon sack contained the six packets of heroin which the scientific evidence showed contained 294.5g of diamorphine.
To further questioning by Insp Chow the appellant said that he had taken the six packets of heroin which were in the white nylon sack from a cardboard box at `Bishan Blk 253`. These questions and answers were also in the Hokkien dialect and duly recorded by Insp Chow and initialled by the appellant. Both these statements were admitted in evidence as part of the prosecution`s evidence without objection from the appellant. It was also in evidence that later the appellant was taken to Block 253 at Bishan Street 22 where he identified the cardboard box from which he had taken the white nylon sack containing the six packets of heroin. The cardboard box was opened and empty. It was the same cardboard box the CNB officers had seen earlier.
The final piece of evidence admitted by the prosecution as part of its case was the cautioned statement recorded from the appellant later that day. It was admitted without objection from the appellant and read: `I have nothing to say`.
Very properly defence counsel did not make a submission of `no case to answer` and the learned judge quite rightly called on the appellant to make his defence. The appellant gave evidence on oath. He called no witnesses.
He said that he lived in a rented room at People`s Park Complex and although he was a carpenter, he earned most of his living by selling contraband cigarettes. On an average he earned about $1,000 per day which he had to share with the van driver who assisted him in making the deliveries. Generally his share was between $500 to $600 per day. His deliveries took him to as far as Jurong. He had met Ah Poh through selling contraband cigarettes to him. On two or three previous occasions he had obliged Ah Poh by delivering spare parts to an acquaintance in Jurong.
In fact on the day previous to the one in question, Ah Poh had contacted him and inquired whether he would be making any deliveries in Jurong that day and if so, whether he would again deliver some spare parts for him to his acquaintance in Jurong. The appellant had agreed as he was going to make deliveries in Jurong the next day and agreed to meet Ah Poh at Block 253, Bishan Street 22 before going to Jurong. He arrived at about 11.40am.
However when he arrived at Bishan Street 22, Ah Poh was nowhere to be seen; but no sooner than he had arrived Ah Poh called him on his mobile phone and told the appellant to go to the coffee shop and wait for him there. So he proceeded in the taxi in which he had come to the coffee shop nearby and ordered himself a cup of coffee. Ah Poh called again on his mobile phone and told the appellant that he could not join him at the coffee shop and requested the appellant to meet him at the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253. He agreed but before going there he purchased a black carrier bag which, he said, would be useful to carry the contraband cigarettes.
He had kept the taxi in which he had come from People`s Park Complex where he lived. He returned to the car park at Block 253, told the taxi driver to wait and went to Block 253 leaving the black carrier bag he had just purchased in the taxi. Ah Poh was not there. He was returning to the taxi when Ah Poh called him again on his mobile phone, told him he could see the appellant from where he was (though the appellant could not see Ah Poh) and persuaded the appellant to pick up the box of spare parts from the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels of Block 253 as he, Ah Poh, was not free to meet him.
The appellant duly obliged. He went to the staircase landing between the third and fourth levels and there was the cardboard box as Ah Poh had said. He lifted it. It was heavy. He peeled off the masking tape and opened the cardboard box. Inside he found a white nylon sack which was also heavy. He decided to leave the cardboard box behind and carried the white nylon sack to the taxi and left in it, having directed the taxi driver to return to People`s Park Complex.
Once the taxi was on its way he decided to see what was in the white nylon sack. On the previous occasions he had delivered spare parts for Ah Poh, he had examined the packages to assure himself that he was in fact carrying spare parts. On this occasion to his utter dismay, he found he was carrying heroin and not spare parts. He was momentarily dazed and upset. He was angry with Ah Poh and wanted to confront him. By this time the taxi was already on the Central Expressway. He suddenly remembered that Ah Poh often frequented Golden Mile area. He directed the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex instead. When the taxi slowed down in traffic along Ophir Road, CNB officers boarded the taxi and arrested him.
When the appellant was asked why he did not go straight to the CNB, as on this occasion he had been fooled by Ah Poh into carrying heroin to his acquaintance in Jurong instead of spare parts as before, his response was that he would not be believed and would certainly be arrested for being in possession of such a large quantity of heroin. On the other hand, he was afraid to throw it away as he feared Ah Poh would become nasty and seek revenge against him. In fact the appellant went on to say that he was not oblivious to the fact he was being watched when he went to collect the spare parts, as he recognized one of the CNB officers as the same person he had seen observing him in Shanghai Road, when he had gone there some three days before to collect money from Ah Poh. He had then thought that the person was a customs officer and was not unnerved when he saw him again at Block 253 as he was not carrying contraband cigarettes but, as he thought, spare parts.
The appellant was also questioned why he had not told Insp Chow when questioned upon arrest that he thought he was carrying spare parts for Ah Poh, if that was what he genuinely thought he was doing until he discovered the stark reality in the taxi that it was heroin instead, and why he had admitted that what he was in possession of and carrying was heroin, his answer was that he was in such a state of surprise and daze that it did not occur to him to tell Insp Chow that the white nylon sack seized was not his, and that when he took it he genuinely thought it contained spare parts. When asked why in his cautioned statement he said that he had `nothing to say` he replied that he thought he would not be believed had he told the truth and furthermore he was under fear of being assaulted by the officers.
It is evident from the foregoing that the defence of the appellant was that he was an `innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin`. His version of the events was that he did not know he was in possession of heroin until he had opened the packets when he was in the taxi returning to People`s Park Complex and what he did after making this discovery was to go and confront Ah Poh for having exposed him to such a grave capital offence.
The learned trial judge found that on `the undisputed facts` the appellant was `in possession of a bag which contained not less than 294.5g of diamorphine`. We agreed with this finding. Next, the learned trial judge relied on the well-known and settled proposition of law that possession of a parcel is very strong evidence of possession of its contents as enunciated by the House of Lords in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 
[1969] 2 AC 256
 in proof of the appellant`s knowledge, subject nevertheless to the appellant`s explanation, that he was in possession of the heroin. The learned trial judge then considered the appellant`s explanation which he said `did not appear to have any ring of truth around them`, concluding with this sentence: 
 
Above all, I found his story that he was in fact on his way to confront Ah Poh at Golden Mile with all the heroin in the bag where he hoped to meet with Ah Poh as the latter was wont to frequent that area, totally unworthy of any credit.
 
 
 
Not only was the appellant`s story that he was on his way to confront Ah Poh, the moment he had seen on examining the contents of the white nylon sack that it contained heroin and not spare parts, totally unworthy of any credit, to use the learned judge`s words, it was plainly an untruth if what the appellant said in his evidence that he was on the point of leaving Block 523, when Ah Poh called him on his mobile phone and told him that he could see the appellant from where he was, (although the appellant could not see Ah Poh) and Ah Poh had persuaded him to return to the third and fourth level staircase landing and collect the cardboard box containing the spare parts was true . It followed that Ah Poh could not possibly have been at Golden Mile Complex or that the whole of the appellant`s evidence about Ah Poh and conveying spare parts for Ah Poh to his acquaintance in Jurong was a fabricated story. Anyhow, the inference is irresistible that the appellant re-routed the taxi to Golden Mile Complex for some reason connected with the heroin he was carrying and not for the purpose of confronting Ah Poh. Furthermore, the manner in which Ah Poh contacted the appellant on his arrival at Bishan Street 22 strongly suggests that Ah Poh was physically present at Bishan Street 22 and observing the appellant unseen.
Finally, the learned trial judge invoked the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act that the appellant`s possession of the six packets of heroin in the white nylon sack containing not less than 294.5g of diamorphine was for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him as the presumption had not been rebutted. But the charge was one of `trafficking by transporting` and not of `trafficking by being in possession`. However that may be, no submissions were made to us that the appellant was transporting the heroin other than for trafficking. The gravamen of the appellant`s defence was that he was duped by Ah Poh into transporting the heroin and that when he discovered that what he was transporting was heroin and not spare parts as he was made to believe, he decided to confront Ah Poh and re-directed the taxi driver to proceed to Golden Mile Complex and not to People`s Park Complex. Presumably what the appellant intended was to return the heroin to Ah Poh and if this was so it would still be trafficking by transporting. See 
 Tan Meng Jee v PP 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 422
; see also 
 PP v Goh Hock Huat 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 274
.
The further points taken on appeal were (a) that the appellant`s evidence that on discovering that he was carrying heroin and not spare parts had immediately redirected the taxi driver to go to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh ought to have been accepted; and (b) that the admission of certain paragraphs of the appellant`s investigation or long statements at the very end of the trial, after the appellant had given evidence and during cross-examination under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, had gravely prejudiced the appellant and resulted in a miscarriage of justice; although the avowed intention was to impeach the appellant`s credibility as a witness under s 157 of the Evidence Act, in fact the purpose was to `ambush the appellant in the witness box` as graphically put by appellant`s counsel.
We see no merit at all in point (a) although it was contended on the appellant`s behalf that his evidence of re-routing was confirmed by the taxi driver`s evidence. Even if this was accepted it would not prove that the appellant was going to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh. We have dealt with this point adequately in the paragraphs above and need not repeat them again.
As for point (b), admittedly the tactics employed by the learned deputy public prosecutor at the trial (who was not the deputy public prosecutor at the appeal) were criticised by the learned trial judge but in truth the learned deputy public prosecutor could not be faulted. We have read the transcripts of the evidence and we are satisfied that the learned deputy public prosecutor was not attempting to supplement the prosecution`s evidence or to withhold material evidence but genuinely desiring to impeach the appellant`s credibility as a witness in view of many inconsistencies in his evidence. We therefore see no substance in this point also.
What we have said in the paragraph above can be demonstrated quite simply. It will be remembered that in his evidence the appellant said that the reason why he wanted to go to Golden Mile Complex was to confront Ah Poh but in his statement he stated quite unequivocally that he told the taxi driver to take him to a place opposite Golden Landmark Hotel as he wanted to purchase small plastic sachets to repack the heroin as he had finished his previously bought plastic sachets. This one statement completely demolished the whole of his evidence of being an innocent and unsuspecting carrier of the heroin who on discovering that he had been duped by Ah Poh was going to Golden Mile Complex to confront Ah Poh. The appellant was shown to be a witness whose evidence was unworthy of credit. In our view the evidence contained in the statement referred to above was rightly admitted in evidence under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act.
In fact there was no prejudice to the appellant as the procedures for the impeachment proceedings were meticulously carried out by the learned trial judge and defence counsel was given reasonable time to take instructions from the appellant on the statements before he was cross-examined thereon.
It was for these reasons that we dismissed this appeal.

The appellant was tried in the district court on one charge of trafficking in 12.14g of heroin by having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. He was found guilty and convicted. In addition, he pleaded guilty to one count of consumption of controlled drugs without authorisation and three counts of failure to attend for urine tests.
A confiscation order under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A, 1993 Ed) (DTA) was made for $142,184.59. The terms of the confiscation order below were that the appellant had to pay a balance sum of $64,307.96 in addition to having all his realisable assets amounting to $77,876.63 forfeited, in default of which he would have to serve four years` imprisonment.
The appellant was then sentenced to 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, three years` imprisonment and two months` imprisonment for drug trafficking, unauthorised consumption of drugs and each of the offences of failing to attend for urine tests respectively. The first two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, the rest concurrently.
By the first appeal, the appellant appealed against his conviction for drug trafficking and the confiscation order. By his second appeal, he appealed against the sentences pronounced. However, the appeal against sentence was abandoned. There was no appeal against conviction for the other four offences.
It was agreed that on 7 August 1995 at about 5.30pm, the appellant was arrested by a group of CNB officers on the ground floor of Block 22 Old Airport Road. The appellant was searched and 18 sachets of heroin were seized from him. Eight sachets were in a sealed plastic bag, five were in a Marlboro cigarette packet, and another five were in another Marlboro cigarette packet. One of the sachets in the last group was open. Also seized from the appellant was an empty straw, a rolled paper pipe, a pager and a Rolex Oyster wrist watch. At CNB headquarters, $18,550 was seized from the appellant. It was admitted that all these items belonged to the appellant.
The flat which the appellant said he slept in was searched, but nothing was found. Neither was anything found at the appellant`s registered address, which was another flat. The appellant gave two urine samples, both of which tested positive for heroin consumption. There was no dispute that the appellant had a long history of drug abuse starting from 1975.
The appellant was sent for a pre-statement medical examination at Alexandra Hospital at around 10.45pm. At about 12.25am, he was sent for his post-statement medical examination. The appellant did not complain to the doctors who examined him that he was suffering from drug withdrawal. There was no allegation that the appellant had been assaulted. The appellant was never seen by any medical officer for any complaint of drug withdrawal during the entire period he was in Queenstown Remand Prison. It was common ground that he made no complaint of withdrawal.
The appellant`s defence was that the drugs were for his own consumption. The appellant was last released from DRC on 16 December 1992. He stopped going for his urine tests because he started to consume heroin again. Apart from a brief period of a month, he did not have any regular employment. According to him, he initially assisted a bookmaker friend of his at the Turf Club. He was paid $200 to $250 for a weekend of work if his friend lost. If his friend won, the appellant was paid $800 to $1000. Subsequently, in June 1993, the appellant became a bookmaker himself. He remained one until he was arrested.
The appellant testified that he suffered from withdrawal after he was brought back from the hospital. However, he did not inform the officer at the CID lock-up of his withdrawal, even though he was rolling about in pain. Nobody noticed him. He did not ask to see a doctor because a DRC inmate had once told him that if he complained he had withdrawal symptoms, he would be taken to Changi Prison Hospital. There he would not be given medication, but would be handcuffed to a bed. The appellant was transferred to Queenstown Remand Prison on 15 August 1995. He never complained that he suffered from drug withdrawal there either.
The appellant`s evidence-in-chief of his drug consumption was that he had already started consuming again in January 1993. At that time, one sachet would last three days. He stopped consuming heroin from June to November 1994. Instead, he switched to L4A tablets. After November 1994, he went back to heroin. A sachet would last him three days then. At the time of his arrest, he was consuming more than one sachet a day, but less than two.
During cross-examination, however, the appellant said that between December 1992 and February 1993, he consumed about one to two straws of heroin a day. He then absconded from drug supervision. From February to April 1994, he consumed about one sachet in two to three days. From April to June 1994, he consumed one sachet a day. He started consuming L4A from June to September. In September, he resumed consuming heroin, but also took L4A. At that time, he took one straw of heroin in about two days. After November, the appellant stopped taking L4A. His rate of heroin consumption increased to one sachet in two to three days. In January 1995, he was consuming a sachet in one to two days. Around April to June 1995, his rate of consumption had increased to one sachet a day. Since June 1995, he consumed more than one but less than two sachets a day.
Initially, the appellant bought his heroin one sachet at a time. He had various suppliers. The price was $120 a sachet. Around April 1995, he started buying five at a time at $100 a sachet. From June onwards, he purchased ten sachets each time. The price then was $70 a sachet. Sometimes, he bought 20 sachets when his supplier had to go to Malaysia. He kept the drugs on his person. His evidence was that he was able to support his habit from his bookmaking income, which he claimed to be about $6,000 a month.
The appellant testified that he had just bought 20 sachets at the Turf Club on 6 August 1995. His supplier had said that he was going to Malaysia. Before dinner that day, he had finished a sachet. He consumed the second sachet by about 3pm on 7 August. He then opened another sachet. According to him, that explained why he was found with 171/2 sachets when he was arrested.
Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) was called as the defence`s expert witness. His evidence was that the assessment of the severity of withdrawal is subjective, depending on each doctor`s evaluation. There is no linear or direct correlation between severity of withdrawal and severity of addiction. There is a host of other variable factors, such as the personality of the addict, his age, physical health, tolerance and underlying motivation. A severe addict can at times exhibit mild withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can fluctuate at different times and it is not possible to predict an individual`s withdrawal symptoms.
It is also possible for an addict to downplay his withdrawal symptoms. There is a perception among addicts at DRCs that playing down withdrawal symptoms would be to their advantage. However, objective symptoms cannot be downplayed. The symptoms given by the appellant on 8 August 1995 are suggestive of mild withdrawal. There is no reported study of any addict in Singapore who could consume 1g of heroin a day without suffering from side effects. However, he had seen addicts in the United Kingdom injecting more than 1g a day without side effects.
Dr Leow Kee Fong (Dr Leow) gave evidence for the the prosecution in rebuttal. His evidence was that, in mild cases, symptoms start after eight to 12 hours, and would peak after 24 to 48 hours. These symptoms, if untreated, do not go beyond five days. Symptoms for severe cases also start after 8 to 12 hours, but peak after 24 to 72 hours. Left untreated, they can last up to two weeks. In moderate cases, they peak after 24 to 48 hours, but can last for seven to ten days.
In Dr Leow`s opinion, there is a direct correlation between the rate of consumption and withdrawal symptoms. Other factors such as health and personality could shift the grading either way. If two persons are compared, the amount of consumption and withdrawal are not the same. In the case of an individual, the more he consumes the worse his withdrawal is.
In his view, it is not possible for someone to consume one and a half sachets a day without suffering from severe withdrawal. It is unlikely that such a person would display only mild or moderate withdrawal symptoms. He has come across addicts taking 1g of heroin a day, but they suffered from serious effects. However, he could not exclude the possibility that there could be no side effect.
Dr Leow also testified that if a person consumes one straw of heroin in two days in September 1994, it would be exceptional for him to be able to increase his consumption to one sachet in two days in October 1994. Tolerance develops over a few months. Furthermore, once consumption is interrupted, tolerance goes down. He would not expect an addict taking L4A and heroin together to increase his consumption of heroin by a large amount when he gives up L4A. The level of increase would depend on the individual.
The district judge preferred Dr Leow`s evidence over that of Dr Lim`s. Dr Lim practised primarily as a psychiatrist and he mainly treated addicts who had post withdrawal behavioral problems. Dr Leow, on the other hand, had treated hundreds of drug addicts who were referred to him for medical examination for purposes of admission in DRC. He therefore had actual experience and knowledge of the linear and direct relationship between addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, Dr Lim`s opinion was based totally on what the appellant said.
The district judge thought that there appeared to be two lines of evidence in the defence`s case. Firstly, the accused was a severe addict with mild withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, the appellant manifested severe withdrawal symptoms at the CID lock-up but chose to suffer in silence. However, Dr Leow was of the opinion that the appellant was not a severe addict because of his absence of severe withdrawal symptoms. While subjective symptoms can be suppressed, objective signs cannot. These objective signs were not present. It was unlikely that the lock-up personnel did not notice it if he had shown severe withdrawal.
"">He was of the view that there was no credible evidence of the appellant`s rate of consumption. The appellant was prepared to downplay his symptoms to avoid admission to DRC or being transferred to Changi Prison Hospital. It was unlikely that he was telling the truth about his consumption pattern at his trial for trafficking. Furthermore, by his own evidence, he had consumed two and a half sachets between noon on 6 August and 4pm on 7 August 1995. This differed from his evidence that he consumed one and a half sachets a day.
The district judge therefore concluded that the appellant was not a severe addict, but a mild one. It was probable that the open sachet was meant for consumption, but there was no point in apportionment because the weight would still be about 11.44g. The minimum sentence would still be 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. There was also no reliable evidence as to the appellant`s rate of consumption. He was satisfied that the presumption of trafficking had not been rebutted.
In the appeal, it was argued that the district judge erred in his understanding of the expert evidence. However, counsel`s argument before me was not that the district judge ought to have accepted Dr Lim`s opinion. Counsel made it clear that he no longer had any quarrel with the evidence given by Dr Leow. His argument was that, accepting Dr Leow`s argument, there was sufficient basis to make an apportionment. Counsel suggested that, accepting that the appellant was a mild addict, apportionment could be made on the basis that he consumed two straws of heroin a day. Fourteen days` supply would amount to about 2.45g, which would then reduce the trafficking charge to one of trafficking in an amount which was less than 10g. The DPP, on the other hand, submitted that there was no credible evidence upon which apportionment could be made.
In my view, there was some credible evidence in the present case. The appellant was no doubt a heroin addict. The prosecution did not dispute that he was anything less than a mild addict. A mild addict could consume one to two straws of heroin a day. The appellant`s evidence ranged from one straw in about two days to one and a half sachet a day, which was, of course, not credible. Despite this, it could credibly be said that his rate of consumption would be in the region of one to two straws a day.
However, I was of the view that any apportionment in this case would not have been material. This is because I could not accept the suggestion that the supply could be for a period of 14 days. Invariably, an accused would say that he had a larger amount of drugs on him than usual because he had just purchased it from his supplier, who inevitably was going `up country`. In the present case, the evidence of the appellant suggested that he had a regular source of supply. In my view, a generous estimation would have allowed apportionment on the basis that he consumed heroin at a rate of one to two straws a day and that, at most, about a week`s supply was meant for his own consumption. This would not have reduced the amount of heroin meant for trafficking to less than 10g.
Next, as a subsidiary argument, counsel urged that the district judge erred when he refused counsel`s application for the appellant`s long statement to be admitted. The long statement was admissible evidence to show consistency.
In 
 Kulwant v PP 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 10
; 
[1986] SLR 239
, it was held that the proper time to determine whether an application to direct the prosecution to produce witness`s statements would be during the trial when there will be material on which the court can decide on relevancy and the desirability of compelling production. In 
 Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
, I held that it is wrong to withhold the accused`s own statements after he has given evidence, because such statements are admissible evidence. However, it was recognised that there could be the danger of an accused tailoring his evidence.
In this case, the defence required the long statement only for the purpose of showing consistency. The application was made when a prosecution witness, CNB Inspector Gopalakrishnan was being cross-examined. In my view, the district judge was perfectly entitled to refuse the application at this stage. As no fresh application was made again after the appellant had given evidence, the appellant had no cause for complaint. However, I must reiterate that I am here only dealing with the accused`s own statements. Different considerations may well apply to statements made by other witnesses. I can imagine situations where cross-examination may be hampered without sight of the witness`s statement.
In the circumstances, I did not think that there was any sufficient ground for me to disturb the appellant`s conviction for trafficking. I accordingly dismissed that part of the appeal.
In relation to the confiscation order, the district judge was of the view that apart from the appellant`s oral evidence that his income was from illegal bookmaking activities, there was no other evidence offered to support the appellant`s claim as to his sources of income. However, before coming to this conclusion, the district judge was mindful that, although bookmaking activities are illegal, it would nevertheless be a valid explanation to confiscation, if the evidence is accepted. Similarly, though the appellant`s evidence amounted merely to a bare denial, it would still be an answer if it was likely to be true. Unfortunately for the appellant, the district judge did not think that the appellant`s evidence was likely to be true.
Counsel argued that the district judge erred when he held that there was no other evidence offered to support the appellant`s claim apart from his oral evidence. Counsel appeared to be referring to the fact that the appellant won the quartet twice in 1993 and was paid some $16,000 and $7,000 respectively. The district judge commented that the appellant did not even produce the cheques for these. I do not think that this error was material. These sums had already been taken into account as legitimate income. There was no other evidence on the record. The appellant`s evidence was that he did not even keep written records of bets placed by punters with him. As such, I could not see what basis I had to disagree with the district judge on this matter.
Secondly, counsel did not agree with the quantum of the benefit. As regards the amount of benefits derived from trafficking, the statement pursuant to s 6 of the DTA showed that, in assessing the appellant`s concealed income, his drug consumption expenses were taken into account. In calculating this, the figures were based on the appellant`s claims in relation to his rate of consumption, ie one straw of heroin a day in January 1993, one sachet every three days from February 1993 till May 1994, an L4A tablet every day from June to October 1994, one straw of heroin a day from November to December 1994, and one sachet of heroin a day from January 1995 onwards.
Counsel`s argument was that these figures had already been rejected by the district judge when he convicted the appellant of the offence of trafficking. It would be incongruous and contradictory, therefore, that they should be relied on when computing the appellant`s hidden income. I agreed with counsel on this point. In fact, I had been troubled by it even though it was not mentioned in the petition of appeal.
It is noteworthy that s 6 of the DTA provides that, where a statement is tendered by the prosecution and the defendant accepts to any extent any allegation in the statement, the court 
 may 
, for the purpose of the assessment, treat his acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates. The court is not obliged to do so. In my view, having found that these alleged rates of consumption were untrue on a balance of probabilities, the court should not rely on them when computing the appellant`s hidden income.
In the circumstances, accepting that the appellant was a mild addict, an acceptable figure (and on this, the burden of proof was on the prosecution) would be one straw of heroin a day. This meant that a fairer estimation of the appellant`s expenses for drug consumption for February to December 1993 should be $12 x 11 months x 30 days = $3,960 instead of $13,200. For January to May 1994, it should be $12 x 5 months x 30 days = $1,800 instead of $6,000. For 1995, the figure should be $12 x 218 days = $3,360 instead of $15,260. Hence, the amount of benefits derived from trafficking should not exceed $116,844.59, as opposed to $142,184.59.
There was, however, yet another difficulty that neither side appeared to be aware of. The prosecution`s case, as accepted by the district judge, was that the amount of benefits derived from trafficking was $142,184.59 and the realisable amount was $77,876.63. The district judge ordered that the realisable amount be recovered under s 7(3) of the DTA. He also ordered that a certificate under s 7(2) be issued stating that the amount to be recovered and the total amount confiscated was not to exceed $142,184.59. He then ordered a default sentence of four years` imprisonment for the balance of $64,307.96 under s 10(1)(b)(iii) of the DTA.
This order was made in April 1996. The district judge did not then have the benefit of my judgment in 
 PP v Hamid Sultan 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 230
. In that case, I held that in view of s 7(3), the amount recoverable under the confiscation order cannot be more than the realisable amount as defined in s 8 of the DTA.
In the present case, there was no issue of any gift having been made by the appellant. The realisable amount as stated by the prosecution was $77,876.63. The proper order should have been that the amount recoverable under the confiscation order was $77,876.63.
Furthermore, the default sentence under s 10 should not be for the balance of $64,307.96, but should be for the amount recoverable. There should be no default sentence for any balance sum, which the appellant obviously cannot pay. The balance amount is not recoverable, and the court cannot order him to pay any part of it unless an application under s 7(6) by the prosecution is successful. Since the court cannot order the appellant to pay the balance, it follows that it cannot order a default sentence for failure to pay it. Taking into consideration the fact that the amount recoverable was a larger sum than the balance which the district judge based his order for default sentence on, the appropriate default sentence was five years` imprisonment.
I therefore varied the order under the DTA. The order I made was that the amount of benefits derived from trafficking was $116,844.59, but the amount recoverable, which includes any amount confiscated, was $77,876.63. If the amount recoverable is not paid, the default sentence was five years` imprisonment, pro-rated for any sum actually paid or recovered.
For these reasons, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction. The appellant`s appeal against the confiscation order was allowed to the extent I have stated.

Judgment:
 
 
 
GROUNDS OF DECISION
These two appeals arose out of two applications by way of Notice for Further Directions taken out by the respective Defendants in these two actions. I shall refer hereinafter to Suit No. 1112 of 1996 as the first action and Suit No. 2323 of 1996 as the second action.
2 In the first action, the Defendants sought the following orders in their application taken out on 29 April 1998:
 
""1. That the trial of Suit No. 2323 of 1996 be heard immediately after the trial in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the same Judge;
 
2. That consequently the trial dates fixed for Suit No. 2323 of 1996 from 16
th
 June 1998 to 26
th
 June 1998 be vacated; and
 
3. Such further or other relief as this Honourable Court shall deem fit.
 
The grounds of this application are -
 
 
(a) There are some common questions of law or fact which arise in both Suits;
 
(b) There are at least four principal witnesses of fact who would testify in both Suits, namely, Patrick Chan Hing Kuen, Kevin Chau Kwok Fun, Chang Kung Git and Poon Sau Yuk;
 
(c) The common question of fact in both Suits, and the testimony of the principal witnesses described above, are of significant importance to the rest of the subject matter in both actions, so that it is desirable that both actions be heard and disposed of one immediately following the other; and
 
(d) It would be more expedient for Suit No. 1112 of 1996 to be heard before Suit 2323 of 1996 because:-
 
 
(i) in terms of chronology, the events in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 started earlier;
 
(ii) the dispute in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 involves a much larger amount; and
 
(iii) the disposal of Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the Court may lead to a settlement of Suit No. 2323 of 1996.""
 
 
 
The first action has been fixed for hearing for 12 days from 11 to 26 August 1998.
3 In the second action, the Defendants sought, in their application taken out on 9 April 1998, similar orders based on broadly similar grounds as follows:
 
""1. That the time for service of this application be abridged, if necessary.
 
2. That time may be extended for the exchange of all affidavits of evidence in chief by a further 1 month from the date of the Order made herein and objections to the contents of the affidavit evidence shall be taken within 1 week after the exchange of the affidavit evidence;
 
3. That time for setting down this action for trial be extended by a further 2 weeks after the exchange of the affidavit evidence;
 
4. That the trial of Suit No. 2323 of 1996 be heard immediately after the trial in Suit No. 1112 of 1996 by the same Judge’
 
5. That consequently the trial dates fixed for Suit No. 2323 of 1996 from 16
th
 June 1998 to 26
th
 June 1998 be vacated;
 
6. Such further or other relief as this Honourable Court shall deem fit.
 
The grounds of this application are:-
 
 
(1) There are some common questions of law or fact which arise in both Suits;
 
(2) There are at least four principal witnesses of fact who would testify in both Suits, namely, Patrick Chan Hing Kuen, Kevin Chau Kwok Fun, Chang Kung Git and Poon Sau Yuk;
 
(3) The common question of fact in both Suits, and the testimony of the principal witnesses described above, are of significant importance to the rest of the subject matter in both actions, so that it is desirable that both actions be heard and disposed of one immediately following the other; and 
 
(4) The making of the order sought will save costs and time.
 
 
Further grounds of this application are set out in the affidavit of Raistlina Kwek to be filed herein.""
 
4 The basis on which these two applications were taken is Order 4 rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court which provides:-
 
""1. (1) Where two or more causes or matters are pending, then, if it appears to the Court -
 
 
(a) that some common question of law or fact arises in both or all of them;
 
(b) that the rights to relief claimed therein are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions; or 
 
(c) that for some other reason it is desirable to make an order under this Rule,
 
 
the Court may order those causes or matters to be consolidated on such terms as it thinks just or may order them to be tried at the same time or one immediately after another or may order any of them to be stayed until after the determination of any other of them.""
 
The Defendants emphasized that they were not applying for consolidation of the two actions.
5 The learned Assistant Registrar heard both applications together on 6 May 1998 and made the following orders:
 
""Affidavits to be exchanged by 3 June 1998. Objections by 10 June 1998. Matter to be set down by 15 July 1998. Trial dates - to be heard by the same Judge after Suit No. 1112 of 1996 from 27 August 1998 to 8 September 1998. Costs in the cause.""
 
6 The next day (7 May 1998), the Plaintiffs in both actions lodged these appeals against the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar. I heard and allowed both appeals on 14 May 1998 and ordered that costs be in the cause. I also made consequential directions for the second action in view of the reinstatement of the trial dates from 16 June to 26 June 1998.
7 On 15 May 1998, the Defendants in the first action lodged an appeal against my decision. On Saturday 16 May 1998, the Defendants in both actions, by separate letters of the same date, asked that I certify that no further arguments were required pursuant to Section 34 (1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. I certified on the same day that I required no further arguments. Immediately, on that day, the Defendants in the second action lodged their Notice of Appeal.
8 I should state at the outset that I am not entirely sure that the Defendants in the first action, by lodging a Notice of Appeal first and asking for the certificate the next day, have complied strictly with the requirements of Section 34(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which states:-
 
""34. (1) No appeal shall be brought to the Court of Appeal in any of the following cases:
 
 
(a) …
 
(b) …
 
(c) subject to any other provision in this section, where a Judge makes an interlocutory order in chambers unless the Judge has certified, on application within 7 days after the making of the order by any party for further argument in court, that he requires no further arguments;"".
 
 
However, it does not really matter in substance as the appeal of the Defendants in the second action is properly before the Court of Appeal.
9 I shall now set out very briefly the allegations in the two actions. In the first action, the Plaintiffs say that they entered into a joint venture with certain Chinese parties to develop three projects in Shanghai, China. The Plaintiffs allege that Patrick Chan acted as agent for the Defendants and negotiated the Defendants’ involvement in the three projects. They also claim that certain obligations were imposed on the Defendants in respect of their involvement in the projects and that the Defendants did not meet those obligations. The Plaintiffs therefore seek an order for specific performance of those obligations and/or damages for the alleged breach of contract.
10 The Defendants deny that the terms of the oral agreements were as spelt out in the Plaintiffs’ claim. They also deny that Patrick Chan was their agent at any time. They claim that Patrick Chan was in fact the Plaintiffs’ agent and that he sought them out in the hope of persuading them to invest in the projects. Two of the projects were to be developed in a joint venture with the Chinese parties and the Defendants agreed to invest in the projects only on the basis that they would be given shareholding interests in the company designated as the Chinese parties’ joint venture partner. The Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs failed to ensure that they were given such interests. The Defendants therefore counterclaim for damages for the Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of contract. Their counterclaim also raises matters pertaining to two other agreements. More details of the first action are set out in the judgment of the Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pung How where His Honour allowed an application by the Defendants to admit Mr Jonathan Michael Caplan QC for the purpose of appearing in the action (see 
Re Caplan Jonathan Michael QC
 (No. 2) 
[1998] 1 SLR 440
).
11 In the second action, the Plaintiffs are suing the Defendants in respect of fees due to them for having acted as consultants in two land acquisition projects in Shanghai. These two projects are not related to the projects in the first action. The First Defendant, Patrick Chan, is the eldest son of the two Plaintiffs here. It should be noted that the First Plaintiff in this action is also the Third Plaintiff in the first action. 
12 The Plaintiffs claim that they had two plots of land for potential development in Shanghai and were looking for parties to invest in the development. DBS Land indicated interest in one of the projects and an agreement was reached for a consultancy fee to be paid to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs claim that as between themselves and Patrick Chan, the fee would be shared in the ratio of 60:40. Patrick, however, asked that the agreement with DBS Land be signed by his company, the Second Defendant here, as he wanted his company to gain a reputation as a deal maker for projects in China. The Plaintiffs agreed. The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants failed to pay them their portion of the fees paid by DBS Land.
13 In respect of the second project, the Plaintiffs claim that Patrick Chan played no role in the negotiations with DBS Land although he signed the deal with DBS Land in the name of the Second Defendant again. The Plaintiffs aver therefore that neither of the Defendants was entitled to any part of the fees paid by DBS Land.
14 On the other hand, the Defendants aver that the said two projects were acquired through their own efforts and no agreement existed for the sharing of fees.
15 Having outlined the broad factual parameters of the two actions, it is now useful to study the sequence of relevant events set out compendiously in the Plaintiffs’ Chronology of Events:-

It is pertinent to note that an application for identical orders as those sought here was filed by the Defendants in the second action on 24 December 1997 but was subsequently withdrawn on 8 January 1998.
16 Two issues emerge from all the above:
 
(1) Is there some common question of law or fact in both actions which justifies an order that the actions be tried one after the other? Alternatively, is there ""some other reason"" rendering it ""desirable"" that such an order be made (see Order 4 rule 1(1)(a) and (c))?
 
(2) Is it desirable that the above order be made when its effect is to vacate 9 trial dates?
 
17 Counsel for the Defendants in the second action tells me that the desirability of having the two actions heard together became apparent after the Honourable Chief Justice delivered his judgment in respect of the admission of Mr Jonathan Michael Caplan QC on 1 November 1997. The Defendants’ solicitors were under the impression then that the second action would be heard in January 1998. They did not know then that the first action’s trial dates had been pushed back because of the difficulties in marshalling the evidence. According, they filed the earlier application in December 1997 and on discovering that the first action was not to be heard in January 1998, withdrew the application. With respect, the question why they did not nevertheless pursue the prayer that the second action be heard immediately after the first action remains unanswered.
18 When the Registrar gave the present hearing dates for the second action at the Pre-Trial Conference on 4 March 1998, the Defendants had asked for late dates as they wanted the first action to be tried first. The Plaintiffs opposed the application on the basis that the two actions were unconnected. I am told that the Registrar informed the parties that he was compelled to give the available trial dates and that if the parties wished, they could take out a formal application. However, this still does not explain why the Defendants took out this application only on 9 April 1998, more than a month after the said Pre-Trial Conference. The delay was exacerbated in that the application was served on the Plaintiffs only on 22 April 1998. The fact that the deadline for the exchange of affidavits of evidence-in-chief (8 April 1998) had just expired when the application was taken out lends support to the Plaintiffs’ contention that the real reason for the application was because the Defendants could not get their affidavits ready in time.
19 On the factual allegations, it appears to me that the central figure in both actions is Patrick Chan. The undercurrent in the disputes seems to be that the father (Mr Chan Kung Git) and his eldest son, Patrick Chan, do not see eye to eye. I am told that there is in fact a third unrelated action between father and son which is part-heard in the High Court. The focus, therefore, will not be so much on the other witnesses in both actions as it will be on Mr Chan Kung Git and his eldest son. If that is so, it appears to me more logical that the second action, which is essentially between father and son, be disposed of first. Hopefully, when the muddy waters in the unfortunate familial conflict have cleared, their true legal positions vis--vis the other parties will also emerge and a long drawn out battle in Court between erstwhile comrades in commerce may be averted. Apart from the facts that father and son feature strongly in both actions and that the stage is Shanghai, I see no other common question of law or fact warranting an order that the actions be tried one after the other.
20 Although the first action involves much larger claims and deals with events which started earlier, it is not necessarily better that it be the vanguard of the two suits. I quote here some of the words used by the Honourable Chief Justice Yong Pung How (in His Honour’s judgment on the admission of the Queen’s Counsel) to describe the first action - ""factually, it was extremely complex""; ""the intricacy of the parties’ business arrangements is plain""; ""the convoluted web of facts which will need to be unraveled""; ""the moneys remitted pursuant to the agreements apparently followed an elaborate route; and the process by which these moneys were disbursed seems to be no less bewildering""; ""the documents given in discovery are far in excess of the norm"". It is clear, and none of the parties before me disputes this, that the first action is much more complicated factually than the second. There is also the issue of the counterclaim there. Good sense dictates that the relatively simpler task be undertaken first. The less complex second action should therefore be heard before the first action.
21 The fact that several witnesses are common to both actions does not take the matter very much further as they will be testifying on different projects and different agreements. As they also appear to be either professionals or business people, I am not persuaded that having them cut off from their work or business for one prolonged stretch of time is necessarily better than two separate but shorter periods. As I have said earlier, one hopes that the second trip from abroad will be obviated after the action between father and son has been disposed of.
22 The related issue here is of course the question of vacating the 9 days of trial in June. In a recent judgment delivered on 20 April 1998 in 
Chan Kern Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd
, the Court of Appeal said:
 
""13. We shall first deal with the issue of vacating hearing dates. In recent years, in the interest of prompt administration of justice and efficiency and to avoid wastage of judicial time, the High Court adopted a strict view on the question of vacating hearing dates. Strong compelling grounds must exist before the Court will consider the exercise of its discretion.""
 
23 In the case of 
Kuah Kok Kim and others v Ernst & Young
 (Suit 193 of 1997), I had cause to borrow the words of the Honourable Chief Justice used on another occasion that:
 
""Trial dates are a very precious commodity …""
 
24 It is possible that other cases may be found to fill all the trial dates if they are vacated since the first date of hearing is more than one month away at the time of the hearing of the applications and of the appeals before me. However, it must be borne in mind that the trial dates fall within the mid-year court vacation and the school holidays. It is probable that many solicitors (and their clients) would have made holiday plans and be unable to capitalize on the vacated trial dates. Above all, I do not think the facts of this case amount to ""strong compelling grounds"" justifying a vacation of the trial dates.
25 Accordingly, I allowed the appeals by the Plaintiffs in both actions.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
The accused, Mohd Nasrul Esyam bin Shamsudin, was tried on the charge that on 30 September 1993 at about 10.10am at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore three blocks containing not less than 5,031g of cannabis, a controlled drug, and had thereby committed an offence under s 7 punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the Act).
Prosecution Case
The evidence for the prosecution by way of statements was virtually unchallenged.
On 30 September at about 10.10am the accused driving a maroon-coloured Proton Saga, TL 2648 (the car), entered Singapore at Woodlands Checkpoint. After he had obtained the Vehicle Entry Permit for the car and had cleared immigration, he drove into Lane 7 for customs clearance. Special Constable Chan Wai Mun (SC Chan) of the Police Dog Unit who was on duty at this lane directed him to park his car at the customs inspection pit for a dog check on his car. On SC Chan's request, the accused handed his passport to him. SC Chan also asked in English if the car belonged to him and he nodded in reply.
After the accused had parked the car at the inspection pit, he was taken to the Dog Handlers' Office, next to the inspection pit, where his particulars were recorded in the Vehicle Record Book by Special Constable Tan Chwee Seng (SC Tan). He was told to get in a chair by the side of SC Tan, with the car within his sight.
SC Chan then led his narcotic detector dog ""Ben 1"" to search the car. When ""Ben 1"" was taken into the car, the dog reacted positively to something in the interior of the car by scratching the back of the driver's seat. Immediately, SC Chan stooped down to check. He found a L-shaped package wrapped with brown masking tape under the driver's seat. He took the package out and held it up and looked at the accused. On seeing the package, the accused jumped up and bolted from his chair. He dashed round the corner, jumped over the fence behind the Dog Handlers' Office, and ran towards Yaohan Best ""The Best Connection"", a departmental store, at Woodlands Centre Road.
Police Constable Chew Hang Khin and a Travel Control Corporal, Tan Hock Guan, immediately gave chase. The two officers saw the accused slide under the roller shutter door of the main entrance of the departmental store. They followed him through that entrance and saw him run into a store room. When they reached the door, they found it locked. With the aid of the shop manager and the storekeeper the door to the store room was unlocked. The two officers caught the accused in the back of the store room. At that time, he was heard to say, ""It is not my thing"". He was handcuffed and brought back to Woodlands Checkpoint where he was detained.
At about 11.30am Inspector Chong Wee Kee, the Investigating Officer (IO), from CNB arrived at the scene. In the course of her investigations, she directed a further search of the car in the presence of the accused. At about 1.40pm SC Chan who carried out the search found two more packages, also wrapped in brown masking tape, hidden behind the side panel of the driver's door. Afterwards the three packages were weighed, again in the presence of the accused, and found to be of a gross weight of 5.6kg. Later, the accused and the three packages were taken to CNB Headquarters.
That afternoon, under the direction of the IO, Sergeant Mohd Fahmi, examined the packages for fingerprints. Only on the L-shaped package were latent fingerprints found but they did not belong to the accused. Also, that day, samples of urine were taken from the accused, and subsequently they were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. They were found to contain morphine.
On 1 October the IO handed the three packages to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. Dr Lee found each of them to contain compressed vegetable material which he analysed and found to be cannabis. On 18 February Dr Lee issued three certificates in respect of the three packages which collectively contained a net weight of not less than 5,031g of cannabis, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the Act.
The IO also made other inquiries, in the course of her investigations. In her evidence she said she had ascertained that the owner of the car TL 2648 was not the accused, but one Kamarul Zaman in Kelantan. The accused had rented the car from him for three days. In cross-examination she confirmed that the accused had in his s 121 statement said that he had come from Kelantan not in the car, TL 2648, but in another car, DW 3554 or DW 3556. In re-examination, she said she had traced DW 3554 as the registration number of a Yamaha vehicle (which in the trial was accepted to be a motorcycle) and DW 3556 was a Mitsubishi wagon, similar to a landrover.
Clearly the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) of the Act applied to the facts in this case. At the close of the prosecution case I found that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused on the charge of importation of the cannabis which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. When called upon him to enter his defence, the accused elected to give evidence.
The Defence
The accused, a Malaysian, aged 20 years at the time of the offence, lived in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan, and was working as a landscape artist. He was a drug addict. He started with ganja or cannabis and progressed to heroin which he called ""obat"".
He first came to Singapore in January 1992. Between then and his arrest on 30 September 1993, he had visited Singapore four to five times. On the previous occasions, he was paid to come to Singapore to fetch a friend back to Kelantan. This time he came to collect batik and dress materials for his friend, Zulkifli.
The accused's evidence was that a few days before his arrest, in Kelantan, he had approached Zulkifli for a loan of RM$500. Zulkifli, however, told him that he could earn the money by driving to Singapore to bring back dress materials to Kelantan for sale. He agreed.
On Zulkifli's instructions he hired the car, TL 2648 for three days at RM$80 per day. Zulkifli gave him RM$100 for the deposit which he paid to the owner. However, the accused did not drive the car as Zulkifli wanted to get the car checked and serviced for the journey to Johor Baru. Instead, Zulkifli asked him to drive another car, a white Proton Iswara, DW 3554. Much later in his evidence the accused sought to retract the number of the car, as regards which he said he might have been mistaken - this was when he was reminded of what the IO had found out from her investigations.
The accused left his home town, Pasir Puteh, in Kelantan at 3.00pm on 27 September. He drove alone. He arrived in Kuantan at about 8.30pm. There, he met Zulkifli who had arrived in car TL 2648, with three passengers, Ismail, Hafiz and Rosdi. After their dinner, they left Kuantan in the same manner - the accused alone and Zulkifli driving TL 2648 with the other three. Together they arrived in Johor Baru at about 3.00am on 28 September. The five of them checked into one room in Hotel Sentosa.
The accused then gave a lengthy account of how he spent the next three days in Johor Baru. Briefly, except for one short outing at 8.00pm on 29 September, he remained throughout in the hotel room consuming drugs by ""chasing the dragon"". The drugs were supplied by Zulkifli.
On 30 September at about 8am, the accused was awakened by Zulkifli and told to drive car TL 2648 to Singapore to collect the dress materials. Zulkifli handed him the keys to the car. Zulkifli also told him that he would leave for Singapore later and that they were to meet at a coffeeshop at the Woodlands Bus Interchange. Before he left, he had a packet of milk and smoked some heroin.
When the accused came out of the hotel, he could not find the car and had to look for it. He found it parked on a road by the side of the hotel. He did not examine the car when he got into it as he had no reason to suspect anything about the car. He drove the car to the Johor Baru Bus Terminal where he had a petition writer enter his particulars in the Disembarkation Form for a fee of Malaysian fifty cents.
Upon reaching Woodlands Checkpoint, he went to a booth to get the Vehicle Entry Permit and to another for his passport to be processed. He then drove the car to Lane 7 for customs inspection. He opened the boot of the car and he was cleared. As he was about to drive off, SC Chan raised his hand to stop him and asked for his passport. He was directed to park the car at the inspection pit for a dog check. At the pit, though he was only asked to open the boot of the car, he voluntarily opened the doors of the car for the dog search. He confirmed that he was asked in English whether the car belonged to him and had nodded that it did.
The rest of the accused's evidence was broadly along the lines of the prosecution case. The accused said that he was shocked to see SC Chan hold up the package, and it was that without thinking, in a moment of panic, he had run away. He was asked why he was shocked. He replied: ""I did not expect `something' to be found in my car."" Later, when he was apprehended, he had repeatedly said: ""That is not mine"".
From the departmental store where he was arrested, he was led to Woodlands Checkpoint by a group of police officers. He said that on the way he saw Zulkifli driving the white Proton Iswara through the Immigration Checkpoint with Hafiz in the car. At that time he was about 25 feet away from the stationary car. He saw the car number, DW 3554. And, he added, he even saw Hafiz get out of the car whilst Zulkifli remained in the driver's seat. In cross-examination, he said he was in a state of confusion, he said more than once ""I felt like a fool at that time"". He did not alert the police officers of the presence of Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Checkpoint. Later, he ventured another reason: as he did not know who the owner of the package was, or the person who had placed it in the car, it did not occur to him to point out the two men to the police officers.
In the course of the lengthy cross-examination of the accused the learned DPP, Ms Christine Lee, sought to impeach the credit of the accused. She wanted to refer to the long statement the accused had given to the IO. This was strenuously objected to by the defence, inter alia, that it was not voluntarily made. Their followed a trial within the trial, at the end of which I allowed certain extracts from the long statement to be admitted as an exhibit (P48A), as I was satisfied that no threat, promise, or inducement had been made in the recording of the long statement.
It is now sufficient for me to state that as I did not, when I found the accused guilty on the charge, rely on any of the extracts of the long statement to determine the creditability of the accused on the facts in issue, there is no need for me to make any further reference in these Grounds of Decision to this aspect of the case.
SUBMISSION
Mr Muzammil for the accused conceded that by virtue of ss 21 and 18(2) of the Act, the presumptions of possession and knowledge operated against the accused. The burden was on the accused to rebut these presumptions on a balance of probabilities. His defence was that he was an innocent courier who had no knowledge that (a) there were three packages hidden in the car, and (b) the packages contained cannabis.
The defence relied on the following items of evidence:
(1) The accused, a drug addict, had consumed heroin on 28 and 29 of September and on the morning of 30 September that he was in a confused state when he drove the car from Johor Baru to Singapore.
(2) The accused only had possession of the car on the morning of 30 September when Zulkifli gave him the key to drive the car; at that time, he had no reason to suspect that there were drugs hidden in the car; he did not search the car.
(3) The car was used by Zulkifli and was accessible to others, including Hafiz, whose shoes were found in the boot of the car.
(4) At Woodlands Checkpoint the accused would have driven away when he had the opportunity but had allowed the car for the dog check; he had even opened the car doors for SC Chan to check the inside of the car. (5) Upon arrest, the accused had repeatedly said that the package was not his.
(6) As the three packages were hidden in the car, the accused could not have known of them.
(7) The accused had maintained his innocence in his cautioned statement by stating that he was not guilty.
The learned DPP, in her written submission, argued that when one considers the totality of the evidence, it was clear that the prosecution had proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
FINDINGS
The issue of fact in this case is whether the accused knew or, at least, had rebutted the presumption of knowledge placed upon him that there were three packages of cannabis in the car when he drove it into Singapore that morning.
On a careful review of the evidence I found that the accused gave an incredible account of how he came to drive the car into Singapore; more crucial and damaging was his conduct at Woodlands Checkpoint, when the package was found in the car. Taking the totality of the evidence I found as a fact that he was not an innocent carrier of the offending packages he had brought into Singapore. The following are the principal findings on the evidence.
(1) That morning the accused was not in a confused state due to drug consumption as he was in full control of himself when he drove the car. He looked for and found the car TL 2648 parked in the vicinity of the hotel; he had his Disembarkation Card properly entered by a petition writer at the bus terminal; and at Woodlands Checkpoint he obtained the Vehicle Entry Permit and got immigration clearance. He appeared normal to the police officers who saw him that morning. And, most importantly, there was no evidence that he suffered from any withdrawal symptoms after his arrest.
(2) The fact that the accused bolted when he saw SC Chan hold up the package, besides proof that he was most alert at that time, proved beyond reasonable doubt, that he knew SC Chan had found the drugs and he had to escape to avoid arrest. To my mind, an innocent carrier would not instinctively run away; he would stay put to find out what was in the package and would want to give his explanation.
(3) The claim of the accused that after his arrest he saw Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Woodlands Checkpoint was a blatant lie. If, indeed, he had seen them, as an innocent carrier the natural survival instinct in him would have surely prompted him to identify them to the police officers as the owner or owners of the package found under the driver's seat.
(4) The evidence of the accused that Zulkifli had arranged to meet him at a coffeeshop at Woodlands Bus Terminal later that morning was another untruth, for if there was such an appointment the accused, as an innocent carrier of the package would have told the police officers of this fact and they would have arranged to set a trap to arrest Zulkifli when he turned up for the appointment.
(5) There was no mention of any of the facts raised in his defence in the cautioned statement; in this statement, he merely stated: ""I am not guilty. That is all"". It seemed to me that if it were the truth that he had no knowledge of the three packages of drugs found in the car, this would have been the easiest thing for him to say in his cautioned statement; and to state that he had seen Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Checkpoint and identify them, or one of them as the owners of the packages. After all, he was accused of a charge which carried the death penalty.
I found that the accused had failed, on a balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumptions. On the evidence as a whole, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty on the charge. He was convicted and sentence of death was passed on him.",1994-06-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:
1              The complainant wife asked for $8750 as maintenance for herself and one child.
2              I awarded $100 as nominal maintenance for the complainant and $2400 for the child monthly, with effect from 1 January 2006. I also made an order for the respondent husband to contribute an additional sum of $500 yearly towards the child’s year-end school expenses. 
3              The complainant wife appeals against the order.
Background
4              Parties were married in Hong Kong in 1987. The complainant wife is currently a manager with xxx Ltd in Singapore. The respondent is a manager with a freight forwarding company in Hong Kong. They have one daughter aged 7 who is currently living with the complainant in Singapore.
5              The complainant said that she completed her O levels in Singapore and then returned to Hong Kong. After she married the respondent, they came to live in Singapore between 1991 to 1997 and obtained their Singapore citizenship. They returned to Hong Kong in 1998 and their daughter was born there.
6              In May 2005 the complainant left Hong Kong with their daughter and they have been living in Singapore since.
7              The respondent filed a divorce petition in Hong Kong in September 2005 and the matter was pending at the time of the maintenance hearing. The complainant had also made a custody application in Singapore. Pursuant thereto, in December 2005 by-consent orders were made for the parties to have joint custody of the daughter, with care and control to the complainant.
8              The respondent in his first affidavit said he was making his affidavit without prejudice to his application for a stay of all proceedings in Singapore. However this stay argument was not pursued at the hearing.      
9              The complainant filed1 affidavit ( CA 1 ) and the respondent filed 2 affidavits ( RA 1 and RA 2 chronologically).    
Respondent’s financial means
10            The respondent said that he could only afford to pay S$2000 for the child and a separate sum of S$800 as his contribution towards the monthly mortgage payments for the xxx apartment the complainant and their daughter were living in.
11            The respondent’s monthly salary was HK$67,000. After his MPF ( provident fund ) deduction, he took home about HK$63,500 ( about S$12,730 ). He also received a monthly travel allowance of HK $4000, and year-end bonus and additional salaries of HK $170,000 annually ( RA 2, paragraph 7 ).
12            His monthly income after MBF and income tax but inclusive of additional salaries and yearly bonuses worked out to about HK$ 66,232 ( S$13246 ). He claimed he was in deficit of about HK$5816 each month. In his revised list of expenses, his personal monthly expenditure ( excluding MBF and income tax ) was HK$72, 048 ( S$14,409 ) [ paragraph 9, RA 2 ].
13            I found the respondent’s claims of being unable to provide more for the complainant and the child without merit.  After deducting the HK$ 14,810 he said he spent monthly on rent and other household outgoings including a domestic help ( items 1, 7,8,10 & 11 on his list of expenses ) and the HK$9000 he sent for the child’s maintenance, this would leave him with HK $42,422 ( S$8484 ) monthly net of MBF and income tax to manage his personal and other expenses. It was a substantial sum and it was hard to see why he should be in deficit especially as he did not have any debts, mortgage or car loan to pay. 
14            It was not disputed that when the family lived together in Hong Kong, the respondent would hand the complainant HK$30,000 for their household expenses. Even after deducting the rent he was still paying and the household outgoings ( HK $14,810 ) and the sums he was sending for the child ( HK $9000 ), there was a balance of HK$6190 from this HK$30,000 he previously set aside for the family’s expenses.  Moreover when the complainant first came to Singapore with the child, the respondent could afford and did voluntarily remit them HK$18,000 per month, which he later reduced to HK$9,000.
15            Whichever way one looked at it, clearly the ability of the Respondent to pay a reasonable sum for the maintenance of the complainant and the child beyond what he was offering was not in issue. The issue turned on what would constitute a fair and reasonable sum for the maintenance of the complainant and the child.
16            Before moving to the quantum issue, I should add that many of the items of expense the respondent claimed in his revised list of expenses were on the high side, while others were voluntary payments that he could reduce or terminate. They could not be set up as reasons for not being able to provide more maintenance.
17            While I would accept that the Respondent might wish to maintain their apartment as his home in Hong Kong for the time being as the Hong Kong divorce proceedings were pending and custody was still in issue, the monthly sums he claimed for utilities ( HK$1100 ), expenses incurred in relation to access in Singapore (HK$12,000 ), clothing and shoes ( HK$2500 ), groceries and daily meals ( HK$5600 ) [( items 7, 12-14, 21-22 respectively in his list of expenses] could be reduced. 
18            The utilities claim for HK$1100 monthly appeared large for someone living alone in the apartment. As for his food bills, he chose to eat out mostly which was his lifestyle choice and even then, cheaper dine-out options were always available. Likewise as he chose to fly by Cathay Pacific to see his daughter each time, it was again a matter of his choice as cheaper airfare options were available. His claim for clothing expenses worked out to a hefty HK$30,000 ( S$6000 ) a year.
19            As regards the HK$9000 savings he said he was setting aside for his daughter each month ( item 3 on his list of expenses ), this savings account was in his name and he was free to deal with the sums whatever his proclaimed intentions. The payments were voluntary and he could terminate or reduce them if the need arose.
20            As for the HK$6,632 monthly he claimed to be spending on insurance polices and mutual fund savings for himself and his daughter ( item 5 of his list of expenses ), some of these expenses related to policies taken out in the 1990s while others related to more recent investment subscriptions. These latter payments could also be reduced or terminated without prejudice to the respondent and again, they could not be set up as reasons for not being able to pay more maintenance. 
Complainant’s income and expenses
21            The complainant earned a gross income of S$7800 monthly. After CPF she took home $6240. Her gross income last year inclusive of bonus was $97,400, and this worked out to S$8117 monthly.
22        In her expenses list, she said she spent S$3502 on herself every month ( PA 1, page 42 ), and S$5228 monthly on their daughter ( PA 1, page 14 ).
23            It would seem that based on her maintenance claim for $8750 which she had set out in her complaint form, she was asking for the respondent to bear her expenses and the child’s expenses on a 100% basis. In my view there was no merit to any contention that the respondent should have to fully bear the maintenance expenses of the complainant and their daughter, as the complainant had always been and continued to work full time earning a substantial salary, and the maintenance of their daughter was a shared parenting obligation.  
Main items in dispute
24            The respondent had objected in principle and quantum to the inclusion and\or the manner of apportionment of certain items claimed as maintenance expenses for the complainant and their daughter.
Mortgage expenses on the xxx apartment serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF
25           The complainant included as part of the maintenance claims of herself and their daughter a monthly mortgage sum of S$1418. She had apportioned it equally to herself and their daughter ( $709 each ). This mortgage related to the xxx apartment in which the complainant and their daughter were currently living in.
26            The xxx property was bought in the joint names of the complainant and the respondent. When they were in Hong Kong the property was rented out. The complainant kept the $1200 rental and used it to top-up shortfall payments to the mortgage. The mortgage had been serviced by both parties’ CPF sums.   
27            The complainant said that after she came to Singapore she made a cash repayment of S$240,000 to reduce the mortgage outstandings on this xxx apartment. 
28            It was submitted for the complainant that the respondent had reaped the benefit of the complainant’s large cash repayment to the xxx mortgage because the complainant was currently able to finance the $1418 monthly mortgage payment solely from her CPF without assistance from him. It was also argued that as the respondent was obliged to provide a roof for the complainant and their daughter, the monthly mortgage payment should be notionally included as part of the maintenance expenses of the complainant and the child and the respondent is obliged to share responsibility for the mortgage expenses as part of his maintenance obligations. 
29            If the mortgage sum was notionally factored into the list of maintenance expenses, this would inflate the sum total of the maintenance expenses of the complainant and daughter that the respondent was being asked to bear as part of his maintenance obligations. This would also mean that part of the maintenance sums paid by the respondent would include the notional mortgage expense but no sum would actually be applied towards the payment of the mortgage which was being serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF.
30            This would not be equitable on a number of fronts. The respondent would not be able to claim the benefit of any direct financial contribution towards the property even though his maintenance payments included the mortgage expenses. On the other hand the complainant would have in her hands the windfall of a cash payment from the maintenance sum that was not being applied towards any actual mortgage expense. Further the monthly mortgage payments she serviced entirely from her CPF would be attributed solely to her as part of her direct financial contributions to the property.
31           
 
To the respondent’s credit, he had volunteered to pay a separate sum of S$800 as his monthly contribution towards the mortgage if the complainant would credit that sum as his financial contribution for the mortgage. I thought this was a fair proposal, however this was rejected by the complainant.   
32            The fact remained that the mortgage payments being currently serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF did not affect her monthly disposal income. The mortgage payments were also capital payments and if the respondent were required to bear part of these payments as maintenance expenses, he should get due credit for it.
33            While the respondent may be said to have reaped the benefit of the complainant’s large cash repayment towards the mortgage, this had resulted from a voluntary act initiated by the complainant. It was not the complainant’s case that there was some pressing reason for her to make the payment of $240,000 towards the mortgage from her own funds because of some act or neglect of the respondent, or that it was the respondent who initiated or suggested the lump sum repayment. In fact the evidence was that the respondent had voluntarily remitted her HK$100,000 when he found out that she wanted to make a capital repayment. 
34            The complainant would receive due credit for her direct financial contributions to the property in the event of a division of assets. Both her cash and CPF payments to the mortgage would be computed as part of her direct financial contributions to the property and this would increase her equity stake in the property. The monthly mortgage payments from her CPF were also identifiable sums that would be refunded back to her CPF account upon a disposal of the property and they remained her personal assets.
35            I therefore excluded the mortgage payment serviced entirely by the complainant’s CPF from the list of maintenance expenses the complainant wanted the respondent to bear. The reality of the situation was that the complainant did not currently need any financial assistance from the respondent with the mortgage.
36            A maintenance order is made taking into account the status quo of the parties as they have ordered their affairs. In the present case the complainant had decided to live in their flat which was previously rented out and she had made financial arrangements to service the mortgage entirely from her CPF. If the complainant had made alternative arrangements for her accommodation or ordered the mortgage situation differently such that cash sums or financial assistance from the respondent were required, these sums could have been identified and included in the maintenance expenses to be shared by the respondent. This was not the case here. However should the circumstances change the complainant was at liberty to apply for a variation of the order.
37            However what I included as maintenance expenses for the complainant and child were the monthly running costs of the property and other household outgoings. This comprised the management corporation fees, property tax, wear and tear, utilities and telephone bills which the complainant said amounted to $906.90 monthly. Of this sum of $906.90, the complainant had apportioned 50% of the management fees, property tax, utilities and telephone bills amounting to $359.20 to their daughter’s list of expenses, and the balance sum of $547.70 monthly was included in her list of maintenance expenses.
Car loan and related expenses apportioned to the list of child’s expenses 
38            The complainant included as part of the maintenance expenses of herself and their daughter a monthly sum of about $1074 paid for the car loan, petrol and car-related expenses. This $1074 was made up of $660 for the car loan and insurance, $124 for car maintenance and carpark charges, and $281 for petrol.
39            The complainant had sought to apportion 50% of the monthly car loan and the insurance (amounting to $334.50 ) and 50% of the petrol costs ( amounting to $140.44 ) to the child’s monthly maintenance expenses.   
40            The car was bought in the complainant’ name. The respondent said the decision to buy a car was her own, and they did not have a car in Hong Kong.     
41            I disallowed the 50% apportionment of the car loan as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The car was a capital asset purchased  in the name of the complainant. Neither was it the complainant’s case that the car was used or purchased mainly for their daughter. In fact the evidence suggested the contrary. The complainant told the court that the daughter took the school bus one-way to school. The complainant car pooled with some neighbours to fetch the child for the return trip. There was also the maid who assisted to bring the child about for her after-school activities like tuition.  
42            It appeared that the car was purchased primarily for the complainant’s convenience. Neither did it seem that the car was used by her and the child equally. The car was a capital asset in her name and she could deal with as she pleased.
43            In principle the respondent should not be made to bear any part of the capital costs of this car as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The complainant should not be allowed to apportion any part of the car loan to the child’s maintenance expenses. I disallowed the $265.50 being 50% of the car loan she was seeking to include as part of the child’s maintenance expenses.
44            The running expenses of the car stood on a different footing. I allowed some of the running costs of the car to be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. I accepted that the daughter did ride in the car, and the complainant sometimes fetched the child from school as part of a car pool arrangement and about for the daughter’s other activities.
45            However the complainant was seeking to apportion 50% of the car insurance and petrol expenses (amounting to $69.09 and $140.40 monthly respectively) as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. The complainant had not established that the car was used equally by herself and the daughter. In fact the daughter’s transportation routine showed otherwise. This purported 50% apportionment of the car’s running costs to the daughter’s list of expenses could not be sustained. In my view it would be more equitable to allow about one-third of the total monthly car insurance and petrol cost expenses (amounting to $140 ) to be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses. 
Child’s education fund
46            The complainant included a sum of  $500 monthly she described as the child’s “ education fund “ in the expenses list of the daughter ( item 21 ).
47            In court the complainant said that this $500 was a monthly payment for a 5 –year renewable unit trust she bought in 2003 in Hong Kong. She had been making the monthly payments for this unit trust from her own funds all along. The respondent said he was not aware of this unit trust.
48            This item 21 expense was for a fund separate from another “education fund” policy she bought in 2004 for their daughter and the life insurance policy for their daughter ( item 20 ). The 2004 education fund policy was being paid for by sums in a Standard Chartered Bank account into which ang pows and other gifts meant for their daughter had been deposited. The life insurance policy had been bought when the daughter was born and the complainant had been paying the monthly premiums.   
49            The complainant said that the $500 monthly expenses for the “education fund” in item 21 was in fact paid for a unit trust bought in her sole name. However it was argued that it should be included in the maintenance expenses as she had bought the unit trust as an educational fund for the child, and she had also made a will for everything to be bequeathed to the child.
50            This $500 should be excluded from the child’s maintenance expenses to be borne by the respondent. The expense was paid for a capital asset legally owned by the complainant. Whatever the complainant’s intentions as regards this unit trust or the provisions of her will, she was free to deal with this unit trust as her own, and she could also terminate the payments at will. The respondent should not be subsidizing as part of the child’s maintenance a capital asset legally owned by the complainant.
51            I had treated this $500 payment for the unit trust in the complainant’s name in a similar manner with the HK$9000 monthly savings the respondent said he was setting aside in the bank for their daughter. They were both voluntary payments for investments legally held by the parties which could be discontinued anytime. Even if the parties intended to set aside these assets for their daughter, it was not a matter that should affect the quantum of the child maintenance to be ordered.     
52            The respondent did not dispute the $43.50 paid monthly for their daughter’s life insurance policy (item 20). He said he was aware of this insurance policy purchased for the child, and the sum was included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses.
Maid’s salary and related expenses apportioned entirely to the child 
53            As part of the child’s expenses, the complainant claimed a total of $904.15 monthly for the maid’s salary and related expenses (items 9-11 on the child’s list of expenses).
54            In my view it would not be correct to apportion all the maid expenses to the child. Even if the maid was engaged primarily for the child as the complainant was a full-time working mother, the maid would also assist with household chores and this would directly benefit the complainant. If the maid expenses were entirely factored into the list of the child’s expenses, this would inflate the sum total of the child’s expenses the respondent was being asked to bear and ignore the benefits derived by the complainant personally.
55            In my view it was more in keeping with the reality of the situation to apportion the maid’s expenses between the complainant and the child. The larger part of the maid’s expenses should be apportioned to the child in recognition that the full-time maid was engaged more for childcare reasons as the complainant was a full-time working mother.  I therefore apportioned the maid’s expenses one-third and two-thirds between the complainant and the child (amounting to $301 & $603 respectively). 
Piano and Computer expenses
56            The complainant claimed $357.33 and $58.23 monthly as the instalment payments for the piano and a computer ( items 4 & 22 on the child’s list of expenses ).
57            I allowed the piano instalments to be included in the child’s list of maintenance expenses. The complainant said the child needed a piano to practise on, and the child had already been having piano lessons when they lived in Hong Kong. Although the piano instalments were a capital expense the piano was purchased solely for the child and had not been unreasonably incurred.
58            Respondent counsel had argued that the sale proceeds of the piano would belong to the complainant. In my view it was quite unnecessary to split hairs over the legal ownership of the piano or its sale proceeds. In all likelihood the piano would remain with the child for some time. In any event its value was not large and it was a depreciating asset.
59            The complainant said that the piano instalment payments would continue until 2007. While the piano instalment payments would cease over time, they may be offset by an increase in existing expenses or new expenses may arise. It would not be possible for the court to factor in all the future variables. Parties would be at liberty to apply to vary the order should there be a material change in the expenses of the child over time.
60            The computer expenses stood on a different footing. The complainant said the computer loan was taken out in her name and the computer was still in Hong Kong. She had all along been paying the computer loan herself. She did not explain why the computer expenses should be included as part of the child’s maintenance expenses, nor was it her case that she had been prevented from taking the computer with her to Singapore.             
List of maintenance expenses for the complainant and child
61            After the reapportionment of the car loan and related expenses, the maid expenses and the computer expenses in the above manner and the deduction of the mortgage serviced by the complainant’s CPF, the complainant’s monthly expenses were recomputed as follows:
 
 
 
 
Property management, tax & wear & tear (items 2 -4 )
 
 
 
  $255
 
 
 
 
 
Car mortgage, insurance, maintenance,carpark & petrol ( items 5-8
 & 26 )
 
 
 
  $934.30
 
 
 
 
 
Utilities, telephone & broadband( items 9 & 10 )
 
 
 
  $292.70
 
 
 
 
 
Maid salary, levy and related expenses ( apportioned one-third )
 
 
 
  $301.40
 
 
 
 
 
Computer in Hong Kong
 
 
 
  $58.23
 
 
 
 
 
Food, medical, insurance, clothes, recreation & other personal
 expenses ( items 11-14, 16-20 )
 
 
 
  $1804
 
 
 
 
 
Total
 
 
 
  $3645. 63
 
 
 
 
62            The above computation of the complainant’s expenses was done without disturbing the quantum claimed by the complainant for each expense item or her apportionment of these expenses between herself and the child such as utilities, food etc (other than the treatment of the car and maid expenses described in the preceding paragraphs ).
63            The maintenance expenses for the child were recomputed as follows :
 
 
 
 
Property management & tax ( items 2 & 3 )
 
 
 
$175
 
 
 
 
 
Instalments for piano ( item 4 )
 
 
 
$357.30
 
 
 
 
 
Car insurance & petrol( items 6 & 26 )
 
 
 
$140
 
 
 
 
 
Utilities, telephone ( items 7 & 8 )
 
 
 
$184.20
 
 
 
 
 
Maid salary, levy and related expenses ( items 9-11 )
 
 
 
$603
 
 
 
 
 
Piano, Chinese, Maths, Ballet lessons & tuition ( items 12-16, 19,
 28 )
 
 
 
$1037.30
 
 
 
 
 
School fees & school bus ( items 17 & 18 )
 
 
 
$102
 
 
 
 
 
Life insurance policy
 
 
 
$43.50
 
 
 
 
 
Groceries & Dining ( items 24 & 25 )
 
 
 
$227.45
 
 
 
 
 
Misc (item 23 )
 
 
 
$150
 
 
 
 
 
Total
 
 
 
$3019.75
 
 
 
 
64            In the above computation the quantum the complainant claimed for each expense item was left undisturbed, save for “Misc” where she had claimed $396.10 monthly. In my view this sum was excessive as most of the child’s needs and more had already been catered for. I instead allowed a sum of $150 monthly for miscellaneous expenses.
65            As regards item 27 ( clothes, shoes and school bag ) the complainant had claimed $58.67 monthly. This would amount to about $700 yearly. As a substantial part of this expense item would relate to year-end school expenses like textbooks, uniforms and shoes etc, I did not include this in the monthly expenses but I ordered the respondent to pay an additional $500 yearly as his contribution towards the child’s year-end school expenses.
66            The complainant’s current monthly take-home salary of $6,240 was about 46% of the respondent’s monthly take-home monthly salary of HK$67,940  ( S$13,588 ). It formed about 31.5% of their combined monthly take-home salary of about S$19,828.
67            In court the respondent had offered to share 60% of  the child’s expenses while the complainant had suggested a 70:30 split of the full sum of $5228.30 she claimed as the child’s expenses in the proportion of their earned income.
68            It was clear that the respondent should bear a greater portion of the child’s maintenance expenses because of his higher income. Moreover when the parties lived in Hong Kong the respondent had borne the larger share of the household expenses. The complainant said the Respondent used to give her HK$30,000 monthly and she would top up another HK$10,000 for the family’s expenses. The sum of HK$12,500 was used for rental and HK$13,000 for household outgoings, groceries and the domestic help. Another HK$11,630 was spent on the child’s educational and other expenses. She also paid for the family’s dining expenses on an alternate week basis.
69            I ordered the respondent to pay S$2400 for the child’s monthly maintenance, this being about 80% of the $3019.75 required to maintain the child monthly. The complainant would have to shoulder the balance 20% of those expenses as part of her maintenance obligations of their daughter. 
70            As for the complainant’s maintenance, the complainant acknowledged in court that she could live within her means. However it was submitted repeatedly that the respondent earned twice as much as the complainant. With respect, when fixing the quantum of maintenance the court is to have regard to all the factors set out in Section 69(4) Women’s Charter, and the income of the parties is only one of the many factors to be considered. The court in fixing maintenance is not primarily engaged only in the exercise of apportioning the respondent’s larger income between the estranged parties.   
71            The complainant had a take-home salary of S$6240, and her personal maintenance expenses amounted to $3646 per month. Even after taking into account the 20% of the child’s expenses she was to bear ( amounting to about $600 ), this would still leave her with about $2000 monthly ( excluding bonuses ), being about one-third of her monthly take-home salary to manage her other liabilities, investments and savings. This was a comfortable financial margin. 
72            Looking at the parties’ lifestyle before they separated, it could not be said that the complainant had become accustomed to a lifestyle made possible by the respondent’s monies that she could not now sustain without substantive maintenance from the respondent, nor was it her case that the respondent had all along been supplementing her personal expenses.
73            While the respondent had paid HK$30,000 monthly for the family’s expenses when they lived in Hong Kong, the complainant herself had also chipped in financially to support the family’s monthly expenses by paying another HK$10,000. Further the HK$30,000 was paid for the household expenses of the entire family and not to supplement her personal expenses.  According to her account, the bulk of the pooled HK$40,000 had been spent on the rent, the maid and the child’s expenses.
74            The respondent continued to bear the major part of the maid and child’s expenses under the $2400 maintenance order for the child. The complainant now only had to shoulder 20% of the child’s expenses ( about S$600 ), compared to the 25% contribution ( HK$10,000 ) she previously made for the family’s expenses.
75            It was not possible to put parties back to the same exact financial positions they were in before they parted. There are now the expenses of 2 households when previously there was one, and the respondent had to incur additional expenses to come to Singapore to see their daughter. While the complainant did not currently need any financial assistance with her accommodation arrangements, the respondent continued to pay rent on the Hong Kong apartment.
76            Neither did I find that the complainant would suffer a drop in her standard of living if the respondent did not pay her substantive maintenance. She was living in a private apartment jointly owned by the parties, she continued to have the services of a maid, and the sums she claimed as food, dining and entertainment expenses for herself and their daughter were factored in full in assessing their maintenance claims. On the contrary it might be argued that her standard of living had been somewhat improved as she now owned and drove a car in Singapore when parties did not previously enjoy that benefit when they lived in Hong Kong.
77            In the circumstances I thought it appropriate to order nominal maintenance for the complainant. This would preserve her maintenance rights should there be a change in her circumstances. I made an order for the respondent to pay her $100 nominal maintenance monthly.",2006-04-17 00:00:00,SG District Court

Lai Siu Chiu J:
1          This was a claim for breach of contract by the plaintiff, TCL Industries (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, against the defendant, ICC Chemical Corporation. As its name suggests, the plaintiff is a Malaysian-registered company. It is engaged in the manufacture of petrochemicals at its plant that is situated at Kemaman, Trengganu (“the plaintiff’s plant”), on the east coast of the Malayan Peninsular. The defendant is an American company and is involved in the trading and distribution of chemicals. It is part of the ICC Industries Inc group of companies whose headquarters are in New York. The defendant’s office is also in New York.
2          At the material time, the plaintiff had a representative in Singapore in a company called Ranson Pte Ltd whose director was Amirtham Mohan (“Mohan”). The defendant, too, had an agent in Singapore in a company called Moraka Pte Ltd (“Moraka”) whose managing director-cum-shareholder was, and still is, Venkatesh Raman (“Raman”). Moraka ceased to be the Singapore agent of the defendant in end 2003 or early 2004. It was replaced by Chemlink Asia-Pacific, which was represented by KP Song.
3          The plaintiff’s president, SVS Rama Raju (“Raju”), was the person who authorised Mohan to negotiate contracts on the plaintiff’s behalf while the person who authorised Raman to negotiate contracts on the defendant’s behalf was Chiragh Sareen (“Sareen”), who was/is the defendant’s international product manager. As at September 2005 (when he affirmed his affidavit of evidence-in-chief), Sareen claimed to have had 14 years’ experience in the trading of chemical commodities. Prior thereto, he had worked in Singapore for two to three years as a product manager for a petrochemical trading corporation.
4          Between December 2000 and 4 July 2003, Mohan and Raman negotiated a total of six contracts on behalf of their respective principals, for the supply of benzene (“the product”) by the defendant to the plaintiff. The first five contracts encountered no problems. The sixth contract, which is the subject matter of this suit, was for the sale of 3,000mt (“the cargo”) of the product by the defendant to the plaintiff at a price of US$387 per mt. The plaintiff’s plant utilises the product to manufacture maleic anhydride (“MA”) that is used to make paints, unsaturated polyester resins and certain food products. The plaintiff’s plant produces MA both as solid briquettes and in its molten or liquefied form.
5          According to the plaintiff, the sixth contract was concluded orally between Mohan and Raman on the evening of Thursday, 3 July 2003 and later evidenced in a sales confirmation dated 7 September 2003 numbered 3S4238 (the “disputed contract”). The plaintiff alleged that the defendant agreed to deliver the cargo at the port of Kuantan, state of Pahang, Malaysia, before the second half of August 2003. However, the defendant only delivered a shipment of 1,949.23mt of the cargo on or about 11 September 2003 leaving a shortfall of 1,050.77mt (“the balance cargo”).
6          Protracted negotiations then took place between the parties. First, the plaintiff was promised that the balance cargo would be delivered. Subsequently (on or about 24 May 2004), the defendant promised to compensate the plaintiff for the balance cargo. Later, the defendant claimed that the balance cargo could not be shipped due to the unavailability of shipping space. The defendant also claimed the plaintiff had waived delivery of the balance cargo. Still later, the defendant alleged that the balance cargo had been subsumed in a new contract agreed between Mohan and Sareen on 19 August 2003, for 2,000mt of the product.
7          In October 2003, the plaintiff notified the defendant that the delay in delivering the balance cargo caused it to suffer production loss and it demanded delivery. The plaintiff’s plant was allegedly shut down for eight days as a consequence of the non-delivery. In the event, the balance cargo was never delivered to the plaintiff. As the price of the product rose beyond the contract price after 25 August 2003, the defendant would have suffered a loss had it delivered the balance cargo.
The pleadings
8          In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that it suffered a loss of US$539,045.01 as a result of the defendant’s failure to deliver the balance cargo, based on the following computation:

The plaintiff also claimed damages.
9          The defendant’s various defences have been briefly referred to earlier in [6] above. In the (re-amended) defence, it was alleged that the defendant was not liable for late delivery if the cause of the delay was wholly beyond the defendant’s control and or not attributable to any negligence on its part. The defendant relied on cl 6 of the disputed contract for this defence. The clause stated that dates of shipment and delivery were approximate only. The defendant denied owing the plaintiff the balance cargo. The defendant further alleged that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss by not taking steps to procure the balance cargo from other suppliers, even though the market price was comparable to the contract price. The defendant identified contract numbered ICC-3S42381A, dated 19 August 2003 (“the amendment contract”) as the replacement for the disputed contract. As the amendment contract was for 1,900mt, the defendant claimed it had fully discharged its contractual obligations.
10        In its reply, the plaintiff contended that the defendant had admitted that it only commenced looking for a vessel on or about 9 July 2003, at which date it did not have the cargo for shipment. Even then, the plaintiff had accepted the defendant’s nomination of the motor tanker, 
Madonna
 (“the 
Madonna
”), as the carrier for part of the cargo. The plaintiff averred that the amendment contract was never sent by the defendant or communicated to the plaintiff in any way. The plaintiff alleged that the amendment contract was neither genuine nor a contemporaneous document.
The evidence
The plaintiff’s case
11        Both Raju (PW2) and Mohan (PW1) testified for the plaintiff. Raman also testified but not for the plaintiff; it was the defendant that subpoenaed him. Sareen (DW1) was still in the witness box being re-examined when the trial was adjourned. Sareen chose not to return to Singapore to complete his testimony before the defendant closed its case, despite the court’s attempts to accommodate his schedule.
12        Mohan delved into the history of the five earlier contracts to show the pattern of trading between the parties and to counter the contentions raised by Sareen on the defendant’s behalf. In his first affidavit (filed to support the defendant’s application to stay proceedings in Singapore which was unsuccessful) Sareen had alleged that although they were representatives of the plaintiff and defendant respectively, neither Mohan nor Raman were authorised to conclude contracts. Sareen deposed that Raman could not conclude contracts without the express written consent of the defendant in New York.
13        Mohan rebutted Sareen’s claims, pointing out that in four of the five previous contracts, he and Raman dealt exclusively with one another and concluded oral contracts, without any input from the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s representatives (including Sareen). Mohan referred to correspondence (e-mail exchanges) between himself and Raman to support his testimony.
14        Mohan recalled only one occasion (in October 2002) when he spoke to Sareen over the telephone while Raman and Sareen were in Seoul, South Korea. Other than that, Mohan had neither spoken to nor corresponded with Sareen in relation to concluding contracts between the parties. That telephone conversation was the only time Sareen was involved in negotiations; Mohan recalled Sareen obtained an increase from him of US$0.50 in the price of US$359 per mt for 3,000mt of the product under the fifth contract. Mohan met Sareen once, when Raman brought Sareen to Mohan’s office in Singapore for a courtesy call. Mohan denied Sareen’s claim that Sareen had telephoned him to object, on at least three to four occasions after the plaintiff had returned to the defendant the signed sales confirmations, to substituting Singapore law as the applicable law and Singapore for New York as the venue for arbitration. Mohan added that because of the late arrival of the shipment under the fifth contract (arriving in Kuantan on 30 December 2002 instead of 12 December 2002), the plaintiff delisted the defendant from its suppliers’ list for the first six months of 2003.
15        For each of the five previous contracts, the plaintiff issued purchase orders to the defendant and these were followed by the defendant’s sales confirmations (which the plaintiff signed and returned) for the third, fourth and fifth contracts. These three sales confirmations had as a footnote the words:
Please sign and return one copy immediately. Failure to do so may at Seller’s option invalidate this contract.
The significance of the above words will become apparent later.
16        Mohan detailed the chronology of events leading to the conclusion of the disputed contract. In late June or early July 2003, Raman contacted him when Mohan was sourcing for alternative suppliers of the product. Raman offered Mohan a parcel of 3,000mt at US$389 per mt. Mohan advised Raman to obtain a letter from the defendant explaining the reasons for the delay in shipment for the fifth contract.
17        Mohan received via e-mail at 1625 hours that afternoon, Raman’s offer of the cargo at US$389 per mt valid up to 1200 hours Singapore time. Mohan negotiated with Raman that same evening and eventually reached an agreement as reflected in Raman’s e-mail dated 4 July 2003 to Mohan, which was received at 9.01am. The price was stated as US$387 per mt with delivery being made some time between 15 to 25 August 2003.
18        By an e-mail dated 4 July 2003 to Raman (which was copied to the plaintiff), Mohan confirmed that the shipment schedule would be 15–20 August 2003 but indicated 10–15 August 2003 would be preferred. Mohan reminded Raman to secure from the defendant the letter (which Raman had indicated would not be a problem) explaining the delay in shipment of the fifth contract.
19        On 10 July 2003, Mohan received an e-mail from Moraka’s staff (Ms Santhi) with an attachment which was the defendant’s sales confirmation numbered ICC-3S4238 (“the sales confirmation”) followed by a facsimile copy that same morning signed by the defendant. Mohan refaxed the facsimile copy in turn to the plaintiff. On 11 July 2003, the sales confirmation duly signed by Raju was faxed by the plaintiff to Moraka, with certain amendments. Next to the shipment schedule, Raju had written the words, “Every effort will however be made for ETA Kuantan 10 to 15th August 2003.” Next to the word “benzene”, Raju had written “ASTM D 2359”. ASTM referred to the American Society of Testing and Materials standard. Raju had cancelled out “New York” and replaced it with “Singapore” as the governing law under cl 14 of the sales confirmation.
20        The letter from the defendant explaining the delay in the fifth shipment never materialised. Indeed (according to Mohan), the defendant subsequently attempted to use the plaintiff’s request for such a letter as an excuse to cancel the disputed contract. Instead, Mohan took it upon himself to write to the plaintiff on 7 July 2003 requesting that the defendant be restored as a supplier of the product.
21        To Mohan’s surprise, he received an e-mail on 11 July 2003 from Raman stating that Raman’s “management” did not wish to proceed with the disputed contract for the reason that the plaintiff had refused to sign the defendant’s contract. Mohan telephoned Raman pointing out that there had been no real delay with regards to the sales confirmation and that the signed sales confirmation (which Mohan had sighted) would be faxed to Raman immediately that day.
22        Meanwhile, as in the case of the five earlier contracts, the plaintiff issued a purchase order dated 12 July 2003 for the disputed contract, which was faxed to Mohan on the same day, who faxed it in turn to Raman.
23        On 14 July 2003, Raman e-mailed Mohan to state that as the plaintiff had changed the arrival dates and arbitration venue, the defendant would not accept the disputed contract. Mohan felt that the defendant was attempting to renege on the disputed contract using the change of terms as a pretext, noting that the terms of the sales confirmation for the third, fourth and fifth contracts had been similarly changed by the plaintiff without objection from the defendant. Even so, Mohan decided he would not threaten the defendant with legal proceedings. Instead, he invited Raman for lunch and managed to persuade Raman to honour the disputed contract.
24        On 17 July 2003, Mohan received Raman’s e-mail advising that “we will be delivering the cargo 2nd half of August” to which Mohan immediately replied, thanking Raman and emphasising that delivery at any earlier time would be most welcomed.
25        On 28 July 2003, Mohan was advised by Raman in an e-mail that he was still working to fix a vessel and that he had cargo in India or Korea. Raman suggested that Mohan buy another load of cargo for earlier arrival as the defendant’s cargo would not be delivered by end August.
26        On 4 August 2003, Mohan sent Raman a gentle reminder that he (Mohan) was still waiting for the nomination of a carrier. Raman replied promptly that he was still working on the matter and inquired when the plaintiff would open a letter of credit for the disputed contract. Mohan replied that the letter of credit could only be opened after a carrier had been nominated; the requisite information for opening of the letter of credit included the port of loading and the estimated arrival date of the carrier. Raman reverted on 6 August 2003 to say he was waiting to hear from Reliance Industries Ltd (“Reliance”), a producer of the product from India.
27        After Mohan pressed him again for a vessel nomination, Raman advised on 8 August 2003 that Reliance would only supply 2,000mt of the product and that it would not be delivered until some time between 13 to 17 September 2003. Mohan reminded Raman that the balance cargo was still outstanding. Prices of the product had steadily risen since July 2003. The plaintiff had produced (at 1AB347) a Chemcross information report which showed that the price of the product free on board (“FOB”) Korea was US$485 to US$500 per mt in September 2003. The defendant produced Platts reports which showed that the price of the product (depending on its source in Asia) hovered around US$435 to US$445 per mt for October 2003 for FOB shipments.
28        On 9 August 2003, Raman replied that he would let Mohan know about the nomination of a carrier and would revert on the balance cargo. Mohan e-mailed a reminder to Raman on the vessel nomination for the partial shipment of 2,000mt and inquired as to the balance cargo. Mohan did not receive a reply from Raman but on 14 August 2003 Raman’s staff notified the plaintiff that the nominated vessel was the 
Madonna
.
29        Around 18 August 2003, Raman informed Mohan that a Malaysian benzene manufacturer, Titan Trading & Chemical, may be able to supply the balance cargo. That supply never materialised.
30        The shipment of 2,000mt on the 
Madonna
 was discharged at Kuantan on 11 September 2003. The plaintiff alleged that the 11 days’ delay caused its factory to shut down (between 2 to 11 September). In addition, the shipment did not comply with ASTM 2359 standards. Mohan testified that the plaintiff kept sufficient stock of the product to keep the plaintiff’s plant running; there was no surplus. The plaintiff planned two to three weeks ahead on the stock of the product it needed. On 3 October 2003, Raju quantified the plaintiff’s loss as US$220,711.70 which calculation he faxed to Mohan who passed it in turn to Raman.
31        On 17 September 2003, Mohan reminded Raman of the balance cargo. Raman replied on the same day that the defendant “wanted to ship with 2,000 mts new business”
.
 In view of the substandard quality of the shipment from the 
Madonna
, Mohan was unwilling to place another order for 2,000mt for the product. Instead, on 1 October 2003 he e-mailed Raman to ask for a quotation for 2,000mt which included the balance cargo. Mohan explained he was willing to order another 1,000mt of the product at market price so that the defendant could ship it with the balance cargo in order to reduce shipping costs.
32        On or about 9 October 2003, Raman quoted US$485 per mt to Mohan for the new contract for 1,000mt. Mohan replied that the price was too high.
33        On 31 October 2003, Raju e-mailed Raman to inquire when the balance cargo would be delivered. Raman replied that he was liaising with Mohan on the matter. On the same day, Mohan e-mailed to Raju copied to Raman, a summary of the entire matter, which included the fact that Raman had offered another parcel of the product as the defendant felt delivering the balance cargo alone would not be cost effective. Raman sent Mohan an e-mail asking for Mohan’s help to resolve the matter, claiming the defendant had already lost US$150,000 for the 
Madonna
 shipment. Mohan understood from Raman that the defendant had sold off its stock earmarked for the disputed contract in order to make a short term gain.
34        Despite pressing him, Mohan did not receive a satisfactory proposal from Raman on the outstanding balance cargo. Eventually, Raman told Mohan in early 2004 that he/Moraka no longer represented the defendant. Mohan was advised to contact the defendant directly on the matter.
35        On 24 February 2004, Mohan requested and was furnished by Raman with the e-mail addresses of Sareen and William Brunger (“Brunger”), the defendant’s president. On 2 March 2004, Mohan e-mailed a summary of the whole history of the disputed contract to Brunger, with a copy to Sareen; Mohan requested delivery of the balance cargo by end March 2004. Mohan did not receive Brunger’s e-mail reply dated 16 March 2004 (copied to Sareen).
36        Not having received Brunger’s reply, Mohan couriered his e-mail message of 2 March 2004 to Brunger on 23 March 2004. By his letter dated 2 April 2004, Brunger forwarded a copy of his e-mail dated 16 March 2004 wherein he expressed surprise that Mohan was reviving the matter for the first time, six months after delivery. Brunger advised Mohan to discuss the matter with Sareen when the latter visited Singapore in May 2004.
37        Sareen met Mohan at Mohan’s office on 24 May 2004 with KP Song. Mohan claimed that Sareen offered to compensate the plaintiff adequately for the outstanding balance cargo. Sareen denied this. However, Sareen also said he needed to discuss with his New York colleagues regarding the exact quantum. After Sareen left Singapore, Mohan sent an e-mail to Sareen on 25 May 2004 setting out what had transpired at their meeting. Mohan recorded his willingness to accept compensation even though he preferred the balance cargo to be delivered. Mohan sent one reminder on 7 June 2004 and another on 17 June 2004 when Sareen did not reply.
38        On 24 June 2004, Sareen finally replied to Mohan stating that the defendant did not recognise the plaintiff’s claim due to the long delay before it was raised. The e-mail message was copied to KP Song as well as to the defendant’s legal counsel, one Paul Falick (“Falick”). Despite furnishing his handphone and office numbers to Mohan in the message, Mohan could not contact Sareen. Mohan asked Sareen by e-mail on 29 June 2004 for a proposal. He followed up with (unsuccessful) attempts to contact Sareen by telephone. Between 20 July and 6 September 2004, Mohan continued to make fruitless attempts to raise the issue of the balance cargo with Sareen. Mohan also wrote to Brunger on 24 August 2004, 
inter alia
, giving a summary of what transpired at the 24 May 2004 meeting, complaining of Sareen’s lack of response to his many messages and reiterating that the defendant still owed the balance cargo. He also communicated with KP Song but to no avail. Mohan concluded that the defendant was stalling for time and did not intend to settle the claim for the balance cargo.
39        On 22 October 2004 and on 9 November 2004, the plaintiff’s solicitors, Wee Swee Teow (“WST”), wrote to the defendant demanding delivery of the balance cargo. WST received a reply dated 11 November 2004 from Falick, the defendant’s New York legal counsel, denying that the defendant owed the plaintiff the balance cargo and raising (for the first time) the issue of the amendment contract being the applicable contract and that it had been performed in full.
40        It was the plaintiff’s case that the amendment contract was a false document. Hence, its authenticity was disputed at the trial. Apparently, WST had made four requests between July to September 2005 to inspect the original document. In September 2005, the defendant’s solicitors advised that the original contract was with the plaintiff. This was denied by the plaintiff and contradicted by Sareen’s second affidavit wherein he claimed that he had personally faxed the document to the plaintiff in Malaysia. I shall return to this document in due course.
41        During cross-examination, Mohan revealed that besides the defendant, the plaintiff procured their supplies of the product from four to five Singapore companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell and Mitsui. Around August to September 2003, when the defendant failed to deliver the balance cargo, the plaintiff bought the product from these suppliers. Questioned why he and/or the plaintiff did not approach these companies to supply the balance cargo, Mohan explained that the product was not always available. In this case, he could not find an alternative source of supply. Mohan clarified that the purchases he made from the Singapore companies were “spot” cargoes. Mohan made an inquiry of ExxonMobil on 28 July 2003 for 2,000mt for delivery before 15 August 2003. Had the defendant delivered the 
Madonna
 shipment by August 2003, the plaintiff could have avoided a shutdown of the plaintiff’s plant as it meant that it had a supply of 4,000mt of the product. (When he testified, Raju explained that locating a parcel of the product in the “spot” market was “not as simple as buying the material off the shelf from a shop. The availability of the parcel at any given time is not certain”. (NE at p 174)). Delivery also depended on the availability of vessels.
42        I have referred to Mohan’s evidence 
in extenso
 because cross-examination cast no doubts on his credibility. More importantly, Raman testified (NE at p 595) that Mohan was very prompt in putting every single thing in writing, as reflected in his many e-mails referred to earlier.
43        Raju’s testimony dealt with the operations of the plaintiff’s plant. He explained that a constant supply of the product was required to keep the plaintiff’s plant operating on a 24-hour basis to produce about 33,000 tonnes of MA per year or 90 tonnes per day.
44        Raju was instrumental for the handwritten amendments on the defendant’s sales conformation for the disputed contract. He testified that he had made the same amendments to the defendant’s sales confirmation for the fourth and fifth contracts before he signed and faxed the documents to Moraka.
45        Raju testified that he had neither received nor signed the amendment contract and denied that the document superseded the disputed contract in relation to the balance cargo. Raju confirmed he would advise Mohan on the quantities of the product required by the plaintiff and the timing thereof. It was Mohan’s duty to negotiate the price, quantity and delivery date. All other terms would be standard as used by the plaintiff for all its purchases. Thereafter, the plaintiff would follow up with the paper work on the contracts.
46        When cross-examined, Raju denied counsel’s suggestion that the plaintiff’s plant shutdown in September 2003 was due to statutory inspection requirements, maintenance and/or economic reasons and not due to the late delivery of the 
Madonna
 shipment. Raju explained that boiler inspection was carried out once every 15 months and the boiler inspection for the plaintiff’s plant was scheduled for October 2003 after the previous inspection in July 2002. However, the plaintiff could (and did) apply for special permission (from the Malaysian Department of Occupational Safety and Health) to extend the inspection period. Sometimes, inspection was postponed because no inspectors were available. In re-examination, the plaintiff produced documents that showed the boiler inspection scheduled for October 2003 was eventually postponed to February 2004.
47        When questioned why the plaintiff did not maintain a stock of the product, Raju explained that it was because the plaintiff usually planned four to six weeks ahead of the exact requirement date. The plaintiff had protected itself with orders for the product for production in August and September 2003. In June 2003, the plaintiff placed an order for 4,000mt which was delivered the following month. 4,000mt of the product was enough to cover the plaintiff’s production until mid August 2003. In July 2003, the plaintiff ordered 5,000mt of the product (including the 3,000mt under the disputed contract). With storage capacity of only 3,000mt at Kuantan port, it was impossible for the plaintiff to store two to three months’ requirement of the product at any one time. It also took the plaintiff 15 to 20 days to transport the product out from the storage tank in order to make room for a new shipment to be stored.
48        Raju testified that had the cargo been delivered in August 2003 as scheduled, the plaintiff would have been able to cover their production requirements up to end September 2003. There was then a high demand for MA. In August 2003, the plaintiff’s sales of solid briquette exceeded their production by 10%.
49        Raju explained that although the plaintiff sued for breach of contract in October 2004, it treated the disputed contract as being in force until 24 May 2004. Hence, the plaintiff used 24 May 2004 as the date for assessment of damages it allegedly suffered as a result of the breach.
50        The plaintiff’s chief production manager, Gopalraj Nagarajan (“Nagarajan”), also testified. Essentially, Nagarajan (PW3) rebutted the defence of waiver raised by the defendant, relying on Nagarajan’s e-mail of 14 August 2003 to Ms Shanti of Raman’s office. In that message, Nagarajan had said:
As the receipt of benzene in time is crucial for us, we are accepting the nominated vessel M.T MADAONA. However, we appreciate if you could reduce the [demurrage] charge as much as possible.
51        I do not agree that an acceptance of a vessel nomination (which was all that the above message said) is tantamount to waiver of the balance cargo. The plaintiff needed the product to continue production of MA; it had no alternative but to accept the defendant’s partial shipment of 2,000mt despite the high demurrage charged by the 
Madonna
. Otherwise, it faced a shutdown of the plaintiff’s plant.
The defendant’s case
52        Sareen (DW1) and Raman (DW3) testified for the defendant together with a shipbroker, R Suraj Ramasamy (“Ramasamy”), whom Sareen engaged to look for vessels to ship the cargo to Kuantan. As stated earlier in [11] above, Raman testified under subpoena for the defendant, although initially he was supposed to be the plaintiff’s witness.
53        Sareen’s testimony (under cross-examination) was roundly criticised by the plaintiff in its closing submissions (see paras 49 to 69, 82 to 104, 124 to 190) as contradictory, inconsistent and illogical. Having reviewed his evidence in its entirety, I agree with the plaintiff’s assessment of Sareen as an unreliable witness. It may also explain Sareen’s decision not to return to Singapore to complete his re-examination. It would further explain the opening paragraph in the defendant’s closing submissions which stated:
[E]nough facts are undisputed that this Court may determine most of the outstanding issues without weighing any conflicts in testimonial or documentary evidence.
I totally reject the above submission for reasons which will become apparent later.
54        Prior to filing his affidavit of evidence-in-chief on 7 September 2005 and his supplemental affidavit of evidence-in-chief on 3 October 2005, Sareen had filed two earlier affidavits. The first affidavit was filed on 25 February 2005 (“the first affidavit”) while the second was filed on 24 March 2005 (“the second affidavit”).
55        In his second affidavit, Sareen had deposed that the amendment contract superseded the disputed contract and the former (though not the latter) contained a New York arbitration clause.
56        The first and second affidavits were filed for the purpose of setting aside service by the plaintiff on KP Song (as the defendant’s Singapore agent) and to obtain a stay of proceedings for this suit, on the basis that the defendant’s standard terms and conditions applied to the defendant’s sales confirmation and it included a New York arbitration clause. The defendant failed in its application for a stay below and its appeal to a judge in chambers against the assistant registrar’s decision was also dismissed.
57        For convenience, I shall review Sareen’s testimony in relation to the various defences filed by the defendant and where necessary, in conjunction with the testimony of the defendant’s other witnesses.
The delivery date
58        The defendant contended that it was not liable for late delivery and for the consequential closure of the plaintiff’s plant as the disputed contract did not have a firm delivery date. In its closing submissions (para 102b), the defendant argued that delivery by the 
Madonna
 (on 11 September 2003) was only 11 days after the contracted period (end August 2003).
59        In the course of cross-examination, however, and after some prevarication, Sareen admitted that he was aware that the plaintiff was an end-user of the product and that it was used to produce MA (NE at pp 238–240). Further, when Raman offered the cargo to Mohan in his e-mail dated 4 July 2003, item 4, which was “arrival”, stated “15–25 August”. The words “ETA” (estimated time of arrival) were omitted. Moreover, the plaintiff’s purchase order numbered 6224 stated the delivery date to be “before 20/8/03”. In addition, on the defendant’s sales confirmation for the disputed contract, Raju had written the words “every effort will however be made for ETA Kuantan 10 to 15th August 2003” (see [19] above).
60        Sareen sought to explain away the omission of the words “ETA” from the disputed contract by claiming that cl 6 of the defendant’s standard terms and conditions which applied to the disputed contract and earlier contracts did not guarantee arrival dates. Unfortunately, the plaintiff’s past dealings with the defendant as evidenced in the third to fifth sales confirmation did not bear out Sareen’s testimony. Those contracts did not contain the words “ETA”. I note, too, that on 17 July 2003, Raman had advised the plaintiff that the cargo would be delivered in the second half of August.
61        The defendant had pleaded that it could not ship the cargo by the second half of August 2003 because of the unavailability of suitable vessel space. Despite its efforts, the defendant could only manage to find sufficient shipping space to ship 2,000mt. Therefore (relying again on cl 6 of its standard terms and conditions), the defendant was not liable as the cause of the delay in shipment was wholly beyond the defendant’s control. (In its closing submissions, the defendant focused on the defence of 
force majeure
, to the exclusion of all other defences it had pleaded.)
62        Sareen claimed that he had instructed Ramasamy (DW2) from Panasia Marine (Tankers) Pte Ltd (“Panasia”) to spare no efforts to secure suitable vessels and that none could be found between mid July to mid August 2003, sailing from Korea and India to Kuantan. The search was extended to cover Taiwan and Japan. Sareen testified that he (and/or Raman) was in daily contact with Ramasamy in this regard.
63        During cross-examination, Sareen revealed (NE at p 374) that the shipment on the 
Madonna
 from Kandla port by Reliance was on a CFR basis (
viz
, costs and freight basis). Consequently, the cost of shipment was borne by Reliance. That being the case, Sareen was hard put to explain why he continued (as he claimed) to instruct Ramasamy to look for vessels until about 19 August 2003, without informing the latter that shipping space for 2,000mt was no longer required. At a later stage of his testimony, Sareen clarified that he told Ramasamy to look for shipping space generally, pointing out that the defendant had other customers in Malaysia (although not specifically in Kuantan).
64        It was also Sareen’s testimony (NE at p 240) when questioned by the court, that at the time the disputed contract was concluded, the defendant did not have a specific cargo for the plaintiff nor an available vessel. He explained that the defendant had various “options” available but clarified he did not mean the word as understood in the “options” market. He claimed that he had requested Reliance to supply the cargo but was only provided with 2,000mt. In other words the defendant took a “short” position and sold the cargo to the plaintiff without having an available supply assigned to the sale.
65        When counsel for the plaintiff requested documents from Sareen evidencing his request for the cargo from Reliance, Sareen said that the documents/faxes were all in his New York office. Sareen suggested that if indeed the 
Madonna
’s tanks had the capacity (as the plaintiff contended) to hold 2,500mt of the product, the reason for the vessel not carrying the additional 500mt was due to stability considerations, to keep the vessel in trim. As Sareen himself said, his answer was pure speculation (NE at p 380) and I dismiss it accordingly.
66        When questioned as to why the defendant did not procure the balance cargo from Singapore suppliers like ExxonMobil and Shell, Sareen claimed such manufacturers/suppliers had a policy of selling only to end-users and not to traders. I accept the plaintiff’s submission that this explanation defies logic, especially coming from a man who had worked in Singapore previously as a product manager in the petrochemical industry.
67        The plaintiff’s submissions at [53] above referred to numerous instances where Sareen’s testimony was inconsistent or where his answers during cross-examination contradicted his written testimony or the defendant’s pleadings. I have only referred to a few instances.
68        In Sareen’s second affidavit, he had deposed (in para 27) that the defendant had some difficulty in obtaining the cargo under the disputed contract and hence only 1,949.23mt were delivered. Realising this was not a valid defence to the plaintiff’s claim for the balance cargo (so the plaintiff surmised), Sareen changed his evidence in the witness stand and claimed that the words he used in his para 27 should not be “3,000mt quantity” but “3,000mt vessel”. I agree with the plaintiff’s submission that the change of words made no sense in the context of Sareen’s affidavit, as it meant the first sentence of para 27 reads as follows:
The Defendants do not deny that there was some difficulty in obtaining the 3,000 MT 
quantity
 vessel under the original July contract, and hence only 1,949.23 MT was delivered.
69        In the same vein, Sareen corrected the first sentence in para 5(b) of the further and better particulars filed by the defendant for para 8 of the defence. He testified it should read as follows:
The defendants were engaged in the process of trying to find a suitable vessel from on or about 9 July 2003 onwards until on or about 18 August for the 
1,949.23 MT
 3,000 MT of benzene under the July Contract.
70        The first amendment Sareen made afforded the defendant no defence at law as difficulty in obtaining a vessel to ship the cargo does not amount to 
force majeure
. The second amendment contradicted the undisputed evidence that had been adduced from Mohan. By 8 August 2003, the plaintiff was aware from Raman that the defendant would be shipping, through Reliance, 2,000mt of the product. Why then would the defendant be still looking for a vessel with a capacity for 3,000mt until 18 August 2003, when its obligation after 14 August 2003 (once the 
Madonna
 was nominated) was only to deliver the balance cargo?
The amendment contract
71        I next turn my attention to Sareen’s testimony on the amendment contract which supposedly superseded the disputed contract.
72        The defendant produced its copy (P4) of the amendment contract claiming that the original had been sent to the plaintiff (which Raju denied). As the plaintiff asserted that the amendment contract was fabricated, the document and the circumstances in which the plaintiff supposedly agreed to this new contract merit closer scrutiny.
73        There were differences between the amendment contract and the disputed contract (Exh P1). The most obvious difference was that the plaintiff did not sign the amendment contract. Further, unlike the disputed contract and earlier contracts (including the May 2003 contract which was produced in court as Exh P2), the amendment contract did not contain the footnote referred to earlier in [15]. It was signed by Sareen on the defendant’s behalf. I should point out that Exh P5 was another signed copy of the disputed contract. Raman (NE at p 630) confirmed that the document was faxed from the plaintiff in Malaysia (according to the transmission time and date stated thereon) on 11 July 2003 at 1428 hours to either the defendant in New York or to Raman’s office. This was shortly after Raman’s e-mail (timed at 1.50pm) to Mohan (at [21] above) indicating the defendant did not intend to proceed with the contract. Exhibit P5 rebutted the defendant’s claim that the plaintiff refused to sign the disputed contract.
74        I note that there was no mention by the defendant of the amendment contract until Falick’s letter dated 11 November 2004 at [39] above. When questioned why (in his e-mail to Mohan dated 24 June 2004 at [38] above) he had not mentioned the amendment contract but only referred to the plaintiff’s delay in making its claim, Sareen gave an unconvincing explanation. He claimed that there were then on-going amicable discussions and he did not want to hurt the other party’s feelings. Sareen admitted (NE at p 437) that there was no reference in the defendant’s invoice and packing list dated 31 August 2003 for the 
Madonna
 shipment to the amendment contract even though the shipment came later.
75        The plaintiff’s assertion that the amendment contract was fabricated found unexpected support from Raman when he testified. Raman had copies of the contracts he concluded with the plaintiff so that he could collect his commission from the defendant. However, he could not recall having seen the amendment contract previously. As far as Raman could remember, between September 2003 until early 2004 when his company ceased to act as the defendant’s agent, the plaintiff and the defendant were still in negotiations to resolve the issue of the balance cargo outstanding.
76        I can only hazard a guess why the standard footnote in the defendant’s sales confirmation was missing from the defendant’s copy of the amendment contract in Exh P2. Sareen must have realised that without the plaintiff’s signature, the inclusion of the footnote would mean the contract was not concluded.
77        In court, Sareen claimed to have personally faxed the amendment contract to the plaintiff in Malaysia, an important fact which was conspicuously absent from his second affidavit, wherein he had asserted that the document superseded the disputed contract.
78        It would be appropriate at this juncture to compare Sareen’s testimony with Raman’s. Although Raman was a reluctant witness, he nonetheless came across as honest and truthful. Raman explained that his reluctance to testify for either party was for the reason that he preferred to be neutral in a dispute which was two to three years old, he did not wish to side with either party nor did he want either party to capitalise on his evidence. Unlike Sareen, Raman did not prevaricate and there were no inconsistencies in his answers. Even though he had ceased to be the defendant’s agent for the Asian market (for benzene, toluene and xylene products), Raman was not biased either in favour of or against the defendant. I noted that Moraka’s appointment as the defendant’s agent was evidenced in a representation agreement dated 4 August 2000 (see 1AB6–10).
79        Raman confirmed that the terms of any sale concluded on the defendant’s behalf would be decided by Sareen. His discretion in negotiating the price would be limited to a small range (say between $343 and $345). If the buyer’s counterproposal fell outside the stipulated price range, he had to revert to Sareen for fresh instructions. Raman testified that Sareen was involved in every aspect of his negotiations with the plaintiff. Further, the key terms of the disputed contract were concluded in Singapore.
80        Raman’s evidence on the understanding of the words “ETA” contradicted Sareen’s. Raman explained that for deep sea cargo (coming from Europe or Brazil) arrival could only be ETA and not guaranteed (NE at p 591). Deep sea cargo would be shipments of 30,000mt at least and the carrier would stop at many ports before it arrived in Asia. For those reasons, it was generally cheaper. For Asian cargo (like the 
Madonna
 shipment), Raman opined (NE at p 627) that the difference between ETA and actual arrival would be two to three days.
81        I also understood Raman’s testimony to be that because of the plaintiff’s urgent need for the cargo, the 
Madonna
 was nominated but the plaintiff had to pay the price by bearing the high demurrage charged by the vessel. Raman said he had the impression that the defendant incurred a loss on the 
Madonna
 shipment although it may not have been US$150,000 as reflected in his e-mail of 31 October 2003 to Mohan (1AB136), which figure he used as a bargaining tool with Mohan. He explained that he had asked for a “reasonable price” there so that the defendant would not lose anything on the balance cargo outstanding. He revealed that the product was then in short supply in Asia whilst demand was conversely high. Questioned by the court, Raman agreed that the defendant may well have sold short on the disputed contract.
82        Raman also agreed that the defendant never delivered the balance cargo to the plaintiff because he and Mohan failed to agree on the price for the new contract of 2,000mt of the product, which included the balance cargo.
83        My favourable assessment of Raman as a witness cannot apply to Ramasamy, who could not have been more different. In his eagerness to help the defendant, Ramasamy sacrificed the truth.
84        Ramasamy testified that on Sareen’s instructions, he had tried on a daily basis to secure any type of vessel for a shipment of 3,000mt of the cargo from mid July until mid August 2003. (This contradicted Sareen’s testimony who claimed that he had asked Panasia to look for vessels well into September 2003). He was also asked to find vessels to ship 1,000mt to 2,000mt. He was tasked with finding vessels sailing from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and India and calling at Kuantan but not from Singapore, Malaysia or Thailand (which would not have been difficult). Ramasamy claimed to have spoken to 50 to 70 tanker owners without success. He testified that he spoke to Mohan on a regular basis to share shipping market information. He was able to recall a specific inquiry from Mohan for a 3,000mt vessel but when cross-examined, was unable to recall the text of his conversation with Mohan.
85        I am of the view that a shipbroker who handles 30 to 40 shipments every month is unlikely (as Ramasamy claimed) to remember an isolated unsuccessful inquiry he made on the defendant’s behalf, particularly when his company did not keep records of failed cargo inquiries. If indeed Ramasamy was in daily contact with Raman and Sareen as he claimed, it is incredible that neither of them told him to stop looking for shipping space of 3,000mt, after the 
Madonna
 was nominated for the partial shipment of 2,000mt to the plaintiff.
The decision
86        It bears remembering that the disputed contract was concluded on the morning of 4 July 2003 when Raman e-mailed the following terms on the defendant’s behalf at 9.01am, which Mohan accepted on the plaintiff’s behalf at 9.57am, well before the deadline of 1200 hrs:

…
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The words “ETA” were not a term of delivery.
87        I find that the defendant was late in delivering the 
Madonna
 shipment. Even if I am wrong in my finding and the term “ETA” was incorporated into the disputed contract, the 
Madonna
 shipment did not arrive at Kuantan in the second half of August 2003 but on 11 September 2003. As the shipment was not deep sea cargo but Asian cargo from India, the defendant (according to Raman’s testimony) only had an allowance of three days to make late delivery, 
viz
, by 3 September 2003 (from 31 August 2003). Consequently, the defendant caused and is liable for the shutdown of the plaintiff’s plant for the period 3–11 September 2003. The defendant’s contention that the shutdown was due to statutory inspection requirements was not borne out as the inspection was postponed to February 2004.
88        Equally, the defendant was in breach of the disputed contract in failing to deliver the balance cargo. I reject its claim that the plaintiff had waived delivery of the balance cargo and had agreed to its replacement by the amendment contract. First, the plaintiff did not waive delivery of the balance cargo by accepting the 
Madonna
 shipment as it did so out of necessity in order to keep the plaintiff’s plant running. I accept Nagarajan’s evidence in this regard (see [50] above). At law, as pointed out in the plaintiff’s closing submissions (citing 
P&M Industrial Company Limited v Winner Bob (HK) Company Limited
 [2000] 233HKCU 1), the defendant bears the burden of proving clear and unequivocal words or acts on the part of the plaintiff that it waived its right to damages or claims.
89        Second, I find that the amendment contract was indeed a fabricated document as the plaintiff contended. Its existence was not known to Raman and not made known to the plaintiff until Falick first raised it in the defendant’s letter dated 11 November 2004, more than a year after it was supposedly concluded on 19 August 2003.
90        It would be appropriate at this juncture to look at the meaning of 
force majeure
 at law. 
Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2000) defined 
force majeure
 as having a more extensive meaning than “Act of God”. The authors cited Bailhache J in 
Matsoukis v Priestman & Co
 
[1915] 1 KB 681
 who held that 
force majeure
 covered dislocation of business owing to (a) universal coal strike; (b) accidents to machinery, but not bad weather, football matches or a funeral. Clearly, the extended meaning has no application in this case.
91        Next, I turn to the 
force majeure
 clause under cl 6 of the disputed contract. It states:
Seller shall not be liable because of late or non-delivery due to accidents, sabotage, strikes, lockouts, labour shortages or disturbances, fires, war, governmental action, requests or regulations (whether valid or invalid), failure of suppliers to deliver, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining packaging or transportation or any other condition or cause (whether similar or dissimilar) beyond Seller’s reasonable control, or which is not attributable to the Seller’s negligence …
In the light of my earlier finding at [64] above, that the defendant sold the cargo short and subsequently covered part thereof by the 
Madonna
 shipment, the 
force majeure
 clause can hardly apply. The defendant failed to discharge the burden of proving that the late delivery (of 1,949.23mt) and non-delivery of the balance cargo was beyond its reasonable control or was not attributable to its negligence, a prerequisite for the application of cl 6. I further note that when questioned by the court, Sareen admitted that this defence was first raised almost two years after the shipment, 
viz
, on 13 May 2005. Yet, as stated earlier at [61], the defendant’s closing submissions centred on this defence.         
92        There is no doubt in my mind that the defendant failed to deliver the balance cargo and attempted to renege on the disputed contract because it was not prepared to sustain another loss in covering the contract at a higher price than the contracted US$387 per mt. The defendant had undoubtedly already suffered a loss for the 
Madonna
 shipment (albeit maybe not US$150,000 as Raman claimed). My belief is reinforced by the fact that Raman attempted to persuade Mohan to subsume the balance cargo in a new contract for 2,000mt of the product, at a price of US$485 per mt. Even if Chemcross’s prices in [27] above are disregarded, the difference between the contract price (US$387) and US$485 is US$98 per mt for the balance cargo or a total of US$102,975.46 (US$98 x 1,050.77mt). When I inquired of Raman (NE 604) why the plaintiff would be so foolish as to agree to a new and higher price for an existing contract (which he acknowledged), he could not give me any reasonable explanation.
93        Finally, I reject the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its loss. Raju had given a reasonable explanation why the plaintiff could not keep surplus stock of the product, due to storage constraints. The unchallenged evidence from Raju also showed that the plaintiff had difficulty obtaining an alternative supply from other sources.
Conclusion
94        Accordingly, I award interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff. I direct that damages for late delivery in the 
Madonna
 shipment and for non-delivery of the balance cargo by the defendant, be assessed by the Registrar with the costs of such assessment reserved to the Registrar. I am not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s claim of US$539,045.01 in [8] above as the quantum of the damages it suffered nor that it should be based on the date 24 May 2004 used by Raju. The plaintiff must have its claim assessed in the usual manner based on the time-honoured principles in

JUDGMENT
Introduction
The defendants are a well known piling company in Singapore. They are one of the businesses founded by a Mr Low Sum. By the mid 1980s when the events resulting in this action occurred, there were various companies in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, including the defendants, which were being run by members of Mr Low Sum's family. These companies had similar shareholders and directors and can conveniently be called ""the Group"".
The defendants' board was chaired by Mr Low Sum himself and other directors included his sons, Low Kwai Wah (""KW Low""), Low Cheng Lum (""CL Low"") and Low Tuck Kwong (""TK Low""). KL Low had day-to-day charge of the defendants and was their managing director until March 1987. CL Low was the managing director of Far Trading Pte Ltd (""Far Trading"") another family company in Singapore but spent much of his time in Jakarta leaving that company to be run by his wife, one Mrs Rosalind Low. TK Low was in charge of the Low family's Indonesian operations in the form of P.T. Jaya Sumpiles, a joint venture with an Indonesian partner. An Indonesian permanent resident, he lived in Jakarta.
In July 1983, the plaintiff, a public accountant with his own practice in Singapore, was introduced to KW Low by another client. This introduction ultimately led to the plaintiff being appointed the auditor of both the defendant company and Far Trading and carrying out auditing and related investigation work in respect of the Malaysian companies in the Group. Over the next three years, the plaintiff had dealings with each of the Low brothers mentioned above and spent much of his time on matters arising out of this association. In April 1987, however, his appointment as the defendants' auditor was terminated and on 14 May 1987, he sent the defendants four bills totalling $216,250, for work he had done during the period January 1985 to May 1987. The defendants refused to pay any of the bills. Accordingly the plaintiff sued.
The plaintiff's claim herein is for work done and services rendered to the defendants at their request. The material work and services were not straight forward auditing and accounting services. The plaintiff has, as he himself openly admitted, been fully paid for all auditing work undertaken on behalf of the defendants and Far Trading. The four bills cover instead additional work in the nature of corporate finance work which the plaintiff said he undertook for the defendants. The work is alleged to have arisen out of an express contract whereby it was agreed that:
(a) the plaintiff would advise the defendants on restructuring and reorganising the defendants and the Sum Cheong Group for a public listing; (b) the plaintiff would prepare the defendants for a public listing; (c) the defendants would pay the plaintiff the sum of $1 million or 1% of the listing capitalization whichever was the higher.
This contract was terminated before the listing was achieved by reason of the sale of the defendant company to Chuan Hup Australia Limited (""Chuan Hup Australia""). The plaintiff however claimed payment for the work done up to the time of termination on a quantum meruit basis.
In the alternative the plaintiff contended that there was a contract implied from the conduct of the parties for the plaintiff to do work and render services to the defendants and for the plaintiff to be paid a reasonable fee for the work and services. Finally, with regard to two of the bills the plaintiff contended, as a further alternative, that there was an express contract in writing for him to do the work detailed in the said bills on the basis of a reasonable fee being paid.
The defence was simple. First the defendants denied that the plaintiff had done the work or rendered services at the defendants' request as alleged. Secondly, they stated that any work which had been done or services which had been rendered were gratuitous and neither party intended them to be paid for.
Thus the plaintiff had to prove that the defendants had asked him to do certain work; that he had done such work and that it was intended that the work should be paid for. In the pleadings, the plaintiff gave full particulars of the work he had done in respect of each of the four bills and his evidence, as presented at the trial, followed the same pattern. Thus it is convenient to consider the plaintiff's claim and the defendants' response to it on a bill by bill basis.
I. Bill for $100,750 dated 30 April 1987
According to its wording, this bill was for work the plaintiff did for the defendants in years 1985, 1986 and 1987 in connection with corporate finance services and the Chuan Hup Australia acquisition. The particulars of work described in the bill differed however quite substantially from the plaintiff's testimony in support of this bill. Essentially the plaintiff's evidence was that this bill covered his efforts in the years 1985 to 1987 to list the defendants on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. The plaintiff's contention and the defence response will be considered separately.
(a) The plaintiff's story From the beginning, the plaintiff saw himself as more than an ordinary accountant. He believed that he could provide his clients with additional services in the form of corporate finance advice and that with his assistance, his clients would have an edge in any corporate venture they wished to pursue. At the time when the plaintiff first met KW Low, he was working with another client on their proposed listing.
Subsequently there were several conversations between the plaintiff and KW Low. Sometime in August 1983, KW Low took the plaintiff to Jakarta to meet his brothers there to obtain their support for the plaintiff's appointment as ""consultant advisor"" to the defendants. The plaintiff had discussions with KW Low, CL Low, TK Low and other personnel about the type of services he could render the defendants. TK Low made a specific query about the plaintiff's fees and he explained that he charged 1% for corporate finance work as in that area it was a practice to charge on a lump sum basis. By corporate finance work, the plaintiff meant obtaining loans and negotiating their terms, public listing of a company and acquisition and sale of companies.
In November 1984, the plaintiff was appointed auditor and tax agent for the defendants. From that time the plaintiff was frequently in the defendants' office in Singapore. The various discussions between the plaintiff and KW Low on the question of a listing for the defendant company culminated in a meeting on 3 January 1984 at the defendants' office. At that meeting only KW Low and the plaintiff were present. KW Low told the plaintiff that he had been appointed to do all preparation and to organise the defendants to allow them to go public either directly or indirectly. The plaintiff accepted this appointment. He perceived his role in the listing as being akin to that of the head of corporate finance in a merchant bank. The issue of fees was discussed briefly. The fee set by the plaintiff was 1% of the total capitalization or S$1 million whichever was the higher and the plaintiff made clear that other work done would have to be paid for separately. In relation to ""other work"" the plaintiff meant pure auditing work, taxation advice, secretarial and other consultancy services. The time frame of the proposed listing was discussed and it was decided the company should go public within a year assuming the defendants' accounts were in order.
The above meeting was the vital meeting at which the plaintiff alleges that the formal contract between the plaintiff and the defendant company for the plaintiff to do all necessary work to take the defendants public was concluded. The plaintiff did not subsequently confirm this conversation in writing nor did KW Low give him any written instructions. The plaintiff's position was that the defendants were an old Chinese family company and that as KW Low had insisted that he must trust the defendants, the plaintiff did not send any correspondence confirming the instructions. The plaintiff did however make an entry in his personal diary confirming his appointment to take the defendants public. Subsequently, the plaintiff says he plunged enthusiastically into his new task. First he produced a paper, at KW Low's request, for the other directors of the defendants listing the advantages and disadvantages of going public. He stressed the advantages stating ""the existing shareholders gain undreamed of riches"" (sic) and ""could the company and its shareholders afford not to afford to be rich?"" (sic). He also briefed the directors after the Annual General Meeting in January 1984 as to the company's plans to go public and received their endorsement.
The plaintiff was ambitious. He wanted the defendants not simply to go public but to ""go public with a bang"" as a recognised blue chip company. For this purpose, the defendant company alone would not suffice. Although it had the advantage of being in a business where there were high profits and where payment was received in advance of the carrying out of the work, it also had the major handicap of being perceived as a largely one customer and one product company. The plaintiff therefore decided that for a successful listing the defendants must be shown to have product, customer and geographical diversification. Over the next few months, the plaintiff and KW Low had numerous discussions on the listing generally and specifically with reference to the other companies in the Group who could be injected into the defendant company for the purpose of listing. At this point, the plaintiff's target date for listing was March 1985.
In April, the plaintiff and KW Low had a meeting to discuss the restructuring of the Group companies for public listing, in particular the Malaysian members of the Group. These were Sum Cheong Piling (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (""Sum Cheong Malaysia""), Sum Cheong Construction Berhad, Hwa Hong Enterprises and Mastercharge Sdn Bhd. It was decided that the plaintiff should do a reporting audit on these companies for the purpose of inclusion in the prospectus for the defendants' listing. The plaintiff informed KW Low that he would have to charge separately for the reporting audit and quoted a lump sum of $100,000. This figure was acceptable to KW Low and he gave the plaintiff the go ahead.
From about July 1984 to the end of 1984, the plaintiff and his staff carried out work on the accounts of the various Malaysian companies. From the start this proved a difficult job. The books and records had not been properly kept, the audited accounts were highly qualified and the personnel of the various companies were not very co-operative. One problem after another was encountered. The plaintiff spent much time in Malaysia on this job. He met KW Low often, both in Singapore and Malaysia. Additionally from about August 1984, TK Low took more interest in the listing procedure and had frequent telephone conversations and some meetings in Singapore with the plaintiff on the issue. When the plaintiff had difficulty in obtaining the co-operation of the management of the various Malaysian companies he enlisted the aid of TK Low. During the year, TK Low also had discussions with the plaintiff on which other companies in the Group could be used for the listing exercise. He suggested the injection of Far Trading, Sumpiles Investment Pte Ltd (""Sumpiles Investment"") and two other companies. As a result the plaintiff also carried out reporting audits on Sumpiles Investment and Far Trading.
By the end of 1984, the defendants were not yet in a position to go for a listing. The companies were still being run as family companies and not as companies to be listed. At this point, seven companies were considered as part of the listing group. They were the defendants themselves, Sum Cheong Holdings, Sumpiles Investment, Far Trading, Sum Cheong Malaysia, Sum Cheong Construction and Hwa Hong Enterprises. The plaintiff had completed the reporting audits for the defendants and Sum Cheong Holdings but he had encountered difficulties with all the other companies.
Up to the end of 1984, the plaintiff had rendered seven bills totalling $82,000 for work in connection with the reporting audit on the various companies mentioned above. He had not however billed for any other work. His explanation was that the other work was corporate finance work and was different from reporting audit work because of the degree of skill brought to bear, the nature of the work and the complexity of problems encountered. The plaintiff wanted to bill for this work and had asked TK Low and KW Low about payment. He was told that he should trust them to pay when payment was due.
In 1985 the plaintiff continued with the reporting audit for the Malaysian companies. In February 1985, he travelled to Jakarta for discussions with TK Low on the listing. The main topic discussed at this meeting was the Malaysian situation as revealed by the plaintiff's investigations into the accounts. On 30 March 1985, there was a meeting between the plaintiff and KW Low in Malaysia at which the listing situation was discussed. At this time the defendants were still not in a position to go for listing. In the plaintiff's minutes of the meeting, there is a note that KW Low gave instructions to ""forget about Malaysia"" meaning leave the Malaysian companies out of the floatation. At that juncture however, the plaintiff was not disposed to accept this instruction and persuaded KW Low to reconsider. Thus the plaintiff's work on the reporting audit work on the Malaysian companies continued.
In 1985, apart from the reporting audit work the plaintiff had numerous discussions and telephone conversations on the listing of the defendants with both TK Low and KW Low. In addition, the plaintiff met merchant bankers from Chase Capital Markets Limited and Singapore International Merchant Bankers Ltd (""SIMBL"") to discuss the possible listing of the defendants. These discussions were of a preliminary nature although SIMBL had given the defendants two preliminary reports on its views. The plaintiff did not agree with the stances adopted by either of the merchant bankers as their plans for listing the defendants seemed to him to be too modest.
By the end of 1985, the listing position was not much further along than it had been at the end of 1984. The defendants and Sum Cheong Holdings were ready but that was all. As regards the other companies: (i) The plaintiff was at a stand still with Far Trading. The defendant company needed to acquire at least 50% of the shares in Far Trading from the individual shareholders but this had not yet happened. Also the work on the accounts had been stopped by Mrs Rosalind Low. (ii) The work on Sumpiles Investment had also stopped as a necessary change in shareholding of the company had yet to be effected. (iii)The plaintiff had realised that Sum Cheong Malaysia could not be a member of the listing group because too many questions on its accounts would be asked and problems were continuing to emerge. (iv) The Sum Cheong Construction audit could not be done as the controlling shareholder did not want to join the Singapore group. (v) In relation to Hwa Hong, the plaintiff's preliminary work had shown that the company was losing money and was not worth injecting into the Group.
Once again the bills rendered in 1985 covered only the reporting audit work. The plaintiff did not render any bills for his corporate finance advice for the same reasons as previously.
From January to August 1985, the plaintiff billed the defendants a total sum of $64,000 for his various reporting audit work (mainly in respect of the Malaysian companies). He also billed them $36,000 for accountancy and statutory audit work done for Sum Cheong Malaysia.
In 1986, little work was done on the direct listing of the defendants. The plaintiff carried out verification and inspection of stock and assets of the Malaysian company. He had discussions with KW Low and TK Low. In April 1986, the plaintiff asked KW Low about his fees and he was told to trust the defendants. In June 1986, the plaintiff prepared a final report on the problems and irregularities in Malaysia.
In July 1986, the plaintiff was informed by TK Low that he was thinking of selling the defendant company to a Japanese company. The plaintiff gave him advice on the proposed sale. In September 1986, on TK Low's instructions, the plaintiff prepared a five year financial record of the defendants for the purpose of evaluation during TK Low's discussion with the prospective buyers of the defendant company. In December 1986, the plaintiff assisted Touche Ross in relation to a management audit conducted on the defendants. It turned out, though the plaintiff was unaware of this at the time, that Touche Ross were the auditors of Chuan Hup Australia and were carrying out this audit for the purposes of the latter's purchase of the defendant company. Finally in January 1987, the plaintiff discovered that the defendant company had been sold that month to Chuan Hup Australia. The plaintiff had not been informed of the sale before hand. Thereafter the plaintiff did no further work on the pure listing aspect. The plaintiff did not send any bills in 1986 for reporting audit work or for other services rendered in respect of the Malaysian companies.
(b) The defendants' story On this bill, the main witness for the defendants was KW Low. He testified that sometime at the beginning of 1984, he had a discussion with the plaintiff on the question whether the defendant company was qualified to be publicly listed. The plaintiff advised KW Low that in order to ascertain this, he would have to go through the accounts of the defendant company for the previous three years and after that they could discuss the question. As a result of this discussion, Mr Low asked the plaintiff to quote a cost for doing the necessary auditing work. He was given a quotation of $100,000 which he accepted and he then verbally instructed the plaintiff to go ahead with the work. KW Low confirmed that the quotation of $100,000 covered reporting audits for the preceding three years in respect of the defendants themselves, Far Trading, Sumpiles Investment, Sum Cheong Malaysia and Sum Cheong Construction. According to KW Low, the plaintiff did the audit but when he was only about three-quarters of the way through, he became involved with TK Low in ventures in Hong Kong and did not complete the work.
KW Low was quite firm in his stand that the plaintiff had been authorised only to carry out the first step in a listing exercise. He did not give the plaintiff a wider brief as the agreement was that after the accounts had been verified, the plaintiff would advise him whether the defendants qualified to be listed. In his view, the first hurdle was to clear the accounts of the ""subsidiaries"". Then if all was in order to proceed, the defendants would have had to engage merchant bankers and auditors to take the listing further. This second step was never reached.
In cross-examination KW Low agreed that the plaintiff was supposed to advise on how the defendant company could be restructured to be listed. He also stated that he had, initially, a time period of one year in mind for the defendants to be listed. As the work started in mid-1984, he expected listing to be achieved in mid 1985. He denied however that he had asked the plaintiff to prepare the defendants for public listing or that he had agreed that the defendants would pay the plaintiff $1 million or 1% of the listing capitalization, whichever was the higher, for work done for public listing. He asserted that as an accountant the plaintiff would be able to do only a certain part of the work involved in a listing exercise and that the rest would have to be effected by a merchant banker. As far as the sum of $1 million was concerned, KW Low's initial evidence was that the plaintiff had told him that this sum had been promised to him by TK Low. The plaintiff however did not explain why TK Low had promised him $1 million and neither did KW Low ask him what this payment would be for. In the later part of his cross-examination however, KW Low stated that the plaintiff had told him that TK Low had promised to pay the plaintiff $1 million if the defendant company was listed.
TK Low also gave evidence on the first bill. He stated that he was first informed of the public listing exercise by the plaintiff. The plaintiff told TK Low that KW Low had ordered him to do the public listing and that the conditions were that the work was to be done in one year and the fee was $1 million or 1%. TK Low asked the plaintiff what would happen if he could not complete the work. The plaintiff said that he had only two or three staff and would not lose much money as he was also the defendant company's auditor. TK Low assured the plaintiff that if the plaintiff needed further time for the work, he would ask his brother, KW Low to grant it.
Thereafter TK Low did not pay much attention to the project as it was under the charge of his brother and he was more interested in the Indonesian business which he had built up. He only spoke to his brother or his father to find out about the listing if the plaintiff had problems and asked for his help. He also testified that from time to time he made casual enquiries of the plaintiff as to how the work was going on. The plaintiff talked a lot but never showed any solid results. When TK Low asked KW Low what the chances of the listing were, he was told that they were not too good but his reaction was to say ""it's okay, don't worry"" as he was not really interested in the listing operation. This portion of TK Low's testimony was not very credible. He was a businessman. As he himself asserted in another context, where he saw an opportunity to make money, he took it. The plaintiff had formed the view that the defendants could raise $100 million in a listing exercise. TK Low would have been aware of this and it is thus unlikely that his role in the operation was that of a disinterested bystander.
The third Low brother who gave evidence, Mr CL Low was also not very clear as to what the listing process was all about. Under cross examination however he did admit that he was aware at the material time that the defendant company was interested in being listed and that the plaintiff was working on this project for the defendants.
The defendants' final witness was Mr Paul Ma, a partner in the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick Singapore. He has been a chartered accountant since 1971 and has practised in areas concerning the floatation of companies. He was put forward as an expert witness. Mr Ma had perused all the plaintiff's bundles of documents and transcripts of the notes of evidence given to him by the defendants' solicitors.
Mr Ma's evidence was that if a company wishes to go public, there would first be an initial review on the company's suitability for listing. If this was favourable then a decision would be made on which professionals ought to be employed to take the company public. These professionals would include the merchant bank which normally acts as manager, lawyers and accountants. The manager of the issue would on appointment draw up a time table setting out target dates for the application and launch, and parties to be involved in the task. The function of the time table is to make sure that the professionals involved keep to the necessary dates to ensure the listing proceeds as scheduled. In the years 1983 to 1985, the manager of an issue was also normally the lead underwriter, a role he impliedly agreed to accept when taking on the task of manager. The exact terms of the underwriting would be agreed later. From Mr Ma's evidence, the role of head of corporate finance in a public listing is a role taken by the lead manager. It would not be normal for an accountant to act as lead manager though he could do so if he was qualified but he would not in any event be able to act as an underwriter.
Having gone through the papers which the plaintiff prepared and put in evidence, Mr Ma gave his opinion thereon as follows: (1) It was not apparent from the work papers provided whether a preliminary review had been carried out to determine the suitability of the proposed companies to be included in the proposed group to be listed, and whether there were any fundamental problems which might exclude any or all of them from being listed. (2) The auditors' qualifications of the accounts of Sum Cheong Piling Malaysia and its poor track record were sufficient to preclude this company from being included in the proposed listing and the reporting accountants' work done on its account was pointless. (3) The work papers showed that in the third quarter of 1984 the plaintiff was experiencing problems in preparing the accountants' report on the Malaysian companies and there was some decision to exclude them from the listing group. (4) It was not clear from the work papers whether by the third quarter of 1984 any decision had been taken on the companies to be included in the proposed listing, the structure of the group, the company to be used as the vehicle for listing and the time table for the listing.
Mr Ma also testified that if he had been involved with the listing of the defendants in the capacity of merchant bank and accountant, he would have expected the following documents to be produced at a late stage of the listing exercise: (1) a time table for the listing exercise (2) a draft prospectus (3) draft Accountants' Report on the results of the group for the last five years, the balance sheets of the group for the last six years and the statement of net assets of the company and the group as at the latest audited balance sheet date, together with the supporting work papers showing what work had been done to satisfy the accountants that the audited accounts can be relied upon and what adjustments had been made to the audited statutory accounts to arrive at the amounts shown in the Accountants' Report (4) draft Accountants' Report on the profit forecast of the group for the current year (5) forecast of the profit, cash flow and balance sheet for three years for the group and supporting work papers to show what work had been done to satisfy the accountant that the forecasts had been properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions adopted by the directors and are consistent with the accounting policies used by the group (6) draft Original Listing Application (for submission to the Stock Exchange) together with work papers to support the numbers and statements included in the application.
According to Mr Ma, it was difficult to tell from the plaintiff's work papers at what particular stage the plaintiff had arrived on the listing of the defendants. He would have expected to see at least some of the documents mentioned above but he had not seen any of them. From the foregoing, it appears that the plaintiff's work on the listing exercise was at a very preliminary stage. Further, in answer to a question under cross examination as to what role the plaintiff was playing in the listing exercise Mr Ma said: ""The role of reporting accountant on the past five years accounts etc. I could also see him performing the role of advising on the companies to be included in the listing. I could not see him doing the work on profit forecast. I could see no work being done on collecting information for the prospectus. I could not see any work on the listing application.""
He also testified: ""I could see no evidence of substantial corporate advice in the documents I have seen. For example I saw no evidence of the proposed structure of the company in the group that was to be floated. I could see a lot of complaints in relation to the Malaysian companies.""
(c) Conclusion on Bill I Having carefully weighed the evidence presented, both oral and documentary, I hold that the plaintiff has proved that on or about 3 January 1984 he was employed by the defendants to advise them on reorganisation and restructure for a listing and to prepare them for such listing for the consideration of a fee of $1 million or 1% of the listing capitalization.
On the point of the contract's existence, the plaintiff's assertions were supported both by the documents in evidence and the notes he made as well as by the evidence given on the defendants' behalf. All the Low brothers were aware that a listing exercise was in progress and that the plaintiff was at the centre of that process. He may not have achieved very much but they were aware he was working on it. A necessary preliminary was the preparation of the accounts. The plaintiff in this connection did a great deal of work, especially in Malaysia, which was recognised and paid for. Along with that he gave advice on various problems that arose from time to time together with his views on how the company should be structured for listing. Unfortunately most of the advice was given orally but such documents as exist buttress the plaintiff's case by showing that in 1984 and at least half of 1985, work in connection with a public listing was being undertaken. The fact that no merchant bankers, lawyers or underwriters were ever formally employed does not damage the plaintiff's case. These professionals would only have been needed once the defendants' listing group had been finalized and the accounts were in such a state that a listing application could have been made.
The absence of documentary evidence such as corporate resolutions on the listing is not, in this case, fatal to the plaintiff's position. From the evidence that emerged, it was clear that the defendant company was run relatively informally and that KW Low as its managing director had a great deal of leeway. In another context, TK Low as an ordinary director was able to contend that he could take various preparatory steps towards binding the defendants to a large project and not only not get formal board approval until just before signing but also be sure that such approval would be forthcoming.
KW Low's evidence in relation to the $100,000 quotation for the reporting audit work was also significant. He considered this quotation, found it acceptable and told the plaintiff to go ahead. He said that that was his usual style of business, that once he had approved a certain action, he would give the green light to proceed. He was not one for documents. It is telling that most of the documents in the case overall were generated by the plaintiff. The defendants on their own appear to have had little use for paper work. All this is consistent with the plaintiff's contention that his appointment was made orally.
On the question of the fee for the work, both KW Low and TK Low remembered the figure of $1 million. Whilst KW Low alleged this was an amount offered to the plaintiff by TK Low, TK Low's own evidence on the question of the $1 million or 1% of capitalization completely supported the plaintiff's stand. Although TK Low says this was what the plaintiff had told him and he had not got it directly from his brother, KW Low, it is significant that he did not challenge it at the time or even speak to his brother to find out whether it was true. He accepted it, probably because it was in line with the plaintiff's previous indications as to what the fee for corporate finance work should be. A man like TK Low who considered $20,000 ""pocket money"", and was willing to pay the plaintiff such a sum from time to time from his own resources, would not have jibbed at a fee of $1 million if the listing actually raised around $100 million as the plaintiff had estimated it would.
The defence pointed out that it was unethical for the plaintiff to charge on a lump sum or percentage basis. The plaintiff did not agree. Probably his interpretation of the relevant accountants' rules was different from that of Mr Ma and the defendants' counsel. In my opinion, even if the plaintiff was wrong, the fact that he should not have charged on that basis does not of itself invalidate the contract. The defendants did not produce any authorities to support their contention that the contract was by reason of the manner of its pricing rendered either invalid or unenforceable.
The next issue is what happened to the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. The plaintiff's stand is that the sale of the defendant company's shares to Chuan Hup Australia amounted to repudiation of the contract which repudiation he accepted. Thereafter he became entitled to payment for the work done pursuant to the contract on a quantum meruit basis.
The legal position in relation to what is popularly called ""anticipatory breach of contract"" is cogently set out in paragraph 1713 of Chitty on Contracts (26 Ed). This states: ""if, before the time arrives at which a party is bound to perform a contract, he expresses an intention to break it, or acts in such a way as to lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that he does not intend to fulfil his part, this constitutes an anticipatory breach of the contract and entitles the other party to take one of two courses. He may ""accept"" the repudiation, treat it as discharging him from further performance, and sue for damages forthwith, or he may wait till the time for performance arrives and then sue.""
In the present case, the performance required of the defendant company was to take such steps as, on the advice of the plaintiff, were deemed necessary to achieve a listing and thereafter to pay the plaintiff his agreed fee. When the defendant company's shares were sold to Chuan Hup Australia, it was clear that all intentions of achieving a public listing in Singapore had been finally abandoned. In fact the work on the listing had been in abeyance for sometime, all parties having turned their attention to other activities. Once the defendants made it clear that listing was no longer on the cards, the plaintiff was entitled to treat the contract as being at an end.
The next question is whether he was entitled thereafter to any payment for the work he had done pursuant to the contract.
The general rule as expressed in ""The Law of Contract"" by G.H. Treitel (8th Edition) is that where a contract expressly provides for a fixed remuneration on the occurrence of a specified event, the court cannot award any other remuneration on those events nor can it award any remuneration if they do not occur. If the general rule applied, the plaintiff would not be entitled to a cent as the specified event which was the listing of the defendant company never took place.
The courts have recognised however that this general rule is capable of leading to unjust results. As a consequence, remuneration may be awarded on a quantum meruit basis in exceptional circumstances. In order to ascertain whether such circumstances exist, it is first necessary to analyse the contract concerned to see whether the obligations of the parties thereunder are ""entire"" or ""severable"". If a contractual obligation is construed as being ""entire"", it means that the contract requires that obligation to be completely performed by one party before the other party's obligation to pay arises. On the other hand, where obligations are construed as ""severable"", payment under the contract is due from time to time as performance of specified parts of the contract is rendered.
Generally, whether an obligation is ""entire"" or ""severable"" can be settled either by reference to the express terms of the contract or to commercial practice recognised by law. Where the contract is silent and no recognised practice exists, the whole of the contract has to be construed to determine the nature of the obligations thereunder. In this case however it is important to note that as pointed out by Treitel (at page 687): ""where a party agrees to do work under a contract the courts are reluctant to construe the contract so as to require complete performance before any payment becomes due."" Treitel attributes this reluctance as arising from the fact that such construction would often lead to the unjust enrichment of the party who receives the benefit of the partial performance.
The contract here contained two important obligations to be performed by the plaintiff. The first was for him to advise the defendants on reorganisation and restructuring so that they could be listed. The second was for him to prepare them for such listing. These obligations obviously involved work which had to be done in stages over a relatively long period of time. Both the plaintiff and the defendants are agreed that at the outset it was envisaged that a year would be required to bring the defendants to a state in which they could apply for listing. In these circumstances, while the plaintiff had quoted an overall fee, this does not preclude payment on a progressive basis. The plaintiff's conduct in fact was consistent with such a position as he did mention the question of payment for his work several times over the course of the next two years. Although the plaintiff was prepared not to insist on interim payments so as not to embarrass the directors with whom he dealt, this does not mean that the obligation that he undertook was an entire obligation. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants is one in which a reasonable remuneration is allowable for partial performance.
I would like to deal here with the defendants' contention raised first when opening their case and again during submissions, that the plaintiff had waived his right to claim remuneration in respect of the contract. First I should state that strictly speaking this point was not open to the defendants as waiver did not form part of their pleaded defence. I need not therefore deal with it in detail. The evidence before me did however satisfy me that the elements needed to constitute a waiver were not present. Even if the plaintiff's failure to render bills for his corporate finance work until May 1987 could have amounted to a representation that he was not going to charge for his work, the defendants did not rely on such representation. They did not show that they were induced to change their position by reason of the representation. Accordingly waiver could not be established.
The question then arises as to what a reasonable remuneration would be. The plaintiff has claimed $100,750. In my opinion, that amount was excessive.
In the first place, in the Statement of Claim the plaintiff stated his claim as being for work done for the period January 1985 to May 1987. In his further and better particulars and in his evidence, the plaintiff gave details of work carried out from January 1984 onwards. When the plaintiff commenced his evidence on the second bill, the defendants' counsel objected to evidence being adduced in respect of that bill for the period before May 1985 on the basis that the claim as presented in the bill encompassed only work from that date. This objection was allowed by me. The work to be assessed under the first bill also must only be that carried out from January 1985 onwards as that was the earliest date covered by the bill and the Statement of Claim.
Secondly, it was clear from the evidence and from the documents that the plaintiff had exaggerated the amount of work done and the time spent. Perhaps this exaggeration was not intentional and the plaintiff did spend all the hours that he said he did on the defendant company's behalf. In several cases, however, an examination of the work indicated that it could not have taken the amount of time the plaintiff said it did. For example, the plaintiff claimed 11 1/2 hours for the preparation of a document listing the advantages and disadvantages of going public. This is a document which Mr Ma's evidence shows to be generally available from merchant banks as a basic document giving advice to clients who are looking into a listing. According to Mr Ma, it is something anyone with experience would not take more than an hour to prepare. The plaintiff had at all times presented himself as a man of experience and wisdom with the qualities needed to guide his clients throughthe intricacies of corporate finance. In fact he said that he was employed for ""special insight leading to wisdom"" and not simply for ""paper pushing"". A man with such expertise would have been able to do the work much more quickly. There were several other documents in respect of which the time claimed did not seem commensurate with the contents thereof like some simple telexes ofa few lines each for which the plaintiff claimed an hour's time.
The plaintiff also purported to claim time on items for which he had already billed in his reporting audit bills such as time spent doing company searches in Malaysia and ""debating and meeting with the management, local lawyers and auditors of the Malaysian companies on many occasions"". When asked by his counsel to explain the components of various items of his working so as to show how the length of time claimed could have been taken up, the plaintiff had difficulty on many occasions. Finally, as was clear from his evidence, the plaintiff is a verbose man much given to long expostulations. The three Low brothers were on the contrary men of few words. The lengthy meetings which the plaintiff testified he had with each of them would have been prolonged by the plaintiff's verbiage rather than by the substance of the matters which had to be discussed. I have to conclude that the work which the plaintiff did could have been done much more expeditiously.
In assessing a reasonable figure to be awarded to the plaintiff I am also influenced by the fact that he did not come at all close to preparing the defendant company for a listing as the evidence of Mr Ma quoted above makes clear.
The plaintiff's counsel urged that when assessing the remuneration due to the plaintiff, I should be guided by the rate charged in the first bill i.e. $200 per hour. I am not disposed to do that. First, the only documentary evidence available as to the plaintiff's usual rates was in his letter of 3 November 1983 to the defendants in which the highest rate he quoted was $55 per hour. Even giving credit for the fact that corporate finance advice involves more skill than auditing, the gap between $55 and $200 is extremely wide. There was no other evidence as to what a reasonable rate for this type of work was at the time it was done. The other problem with going on an hourly rate basis is that for the reasons stated earlier, I do not believe that it would be fair to charge the defendants strictly on the time, some 286 hours, which the plaintiff claims to have spent on work pursuant to the contract between 1985 and 1987. Thus the amount payable is left at large and I have, to paraphrase the words of Lord Wright in Way v Latilla < 1937 > 3 All ER 759 at 766, to do the best I can to arrive at a figure which seems to me fair and reasonable to both parties, on all the facts of the case.
In the result, having weighed all the factors, it is my judgment that $30,000 is a reasonable amount to be awarded to the plaintiff for the work that he did in connection with the listing over and above the reporting audit for which he has already been generously remunerated.
II. Bill for $100,500 dated 1 May 1987
The plaintiff described this bill as covering his corporate finance services rendered on TK Low's instructions from May 1985, through 1986 and into 1987 in respect of: (a) shell company operations; (b) the proposed construction and management of a port at Mawan, China; (c) the joint venture between the defendants and Nanhai Oil Shenzen Development and Services Corporation; (d) proposed borrowing of US$100 million; (e) Xiamen Harbour project; (f) Wuhan Hotel project and joint venture; and (g) various miscellaneous services and advice in connection with the foregoing.
The plaintiff's stand was that all of the above work arose out of and was part of the services which he was to perform under the contract for the public listing of the defendants. Alternatively, that there had been an implied contract for him to do the various work and services on the basis of a reasonable remuneration. The implied contract arose out of the fact that the defendants had asked him to do work in a professional capacity well knowing that such work would have to be paid for.
When the plaintiff commenced his evidence on this bill, a preliminary objection was taken that the statement of claim was for work during the period January 1985 onwards and the bill itself was for work from May onwards. Accordingly remuneration was not being claimed for work done prior to May 1985 and evidence in respect thereof should not be allowed. I agreed with the objection. The plaintiff's counsel accepted this ruling. He did not offer any evidence in respect of item (d) of the bill which related to the proposed borrowing of US$100 million as that transaction occurred in 1984. Secondly in respect of the shell company operations, the evidence he offered commenced from May 1985. I shall deal with the items in the manner in which the plaintiff presented them.
(a) The shell company operations This sub-heading refers to the plaintiff's attempts to find a listed company in Hong Kong which would be open for purchase by the defendants so as to achieve a back-door listing in Hong Kong.
The plaintiff testified that it was clear by the end of 1984 that the work on directly listing the defendant company on the Singapore Stock Exchange was running into difficulty. He therefore proposed to the defendants that they seek an indirect listing in Hong Kong by acquiring a shell company. Prior to May 1985, he had had dealings with personnel from Chase Manhattan Asia and Wardley Limited in relation to such an acquisition. Various companies had been offered for the defendants' consideration. In May 1985, the plaintiff and TK Low travelled to Hong Kong to further their investigations. It is important to note here that in all the shell company dealings, the principal involved on behalf of the defendants was TK Low. KW Low was only occasionally involved.
The plaintiff spent eight days in Hong Kong on that occasion. The time was used in meetings with TK Low, the bankers, the principals in the companies concerned and various other professionals in connection with the shell company acquisition. As a result, there was a decision on the part of TK Low to acquire a company known as Well Fung Properties & Investment Ltd. On 9 May 1985, the plaintiff drafted instructions to Wardley Limited to make an offer for Well Fung. This letter was signed by TK Low and was written on the letterhead of a company called Sum (H.K.) Investment Ltd whose address was given as care of Sum Cheong Piling Pte Ltd. Thereafter the plaintiff spent five more days attending and assisting TK Low in meeting various parties in Hong Kong with regard to the proposed acquisition. The plaintiff returned to Singapore on 14 May 1985.
On 20 May 1985, Wardley informed the plaintiff that the offer for Well Fung had been rejected. The plaintiff discussed this rejection with TK Low and also the various requirements of the Hong Kong Securities Commission which would need to be met for a company purchased by TK Low to continue to be listed after the purchase. The problems involved in such an acquisition were discussed several times over the next few days. Among the options discussed was that of abandoning completely the search for a suitable company.
On 29 May 1985 the plaintiff received a telex from Wardley advising him that there was a good possibility that another shell company would be available soon. The plaintiff then sent a telex on 3 June 1985 to Wardley stating that ""we thought it best to defer for a period to end of June our intention to acquire a listed shell because we cannot meet the guarantees stipulated by the authorities just now."" In his testimony, the plaintiff said that he took this course because the defendants were unable to meet the requirements of the securities commission and the negotiating tactics adopted by the defendants were wrong. Thereafter nothing further was done in relation to shell companies. It is significant that the plaintiff did not testify that instructions were given to him by the defendants to abandon the search. He seems to have abandoned it of his own accord. According to the plaintiff's further and better particulars, he spent 116 hours in May and June 1985 on the shell company project.
The defendants' stand was that the search for a shell company had nothing to do with the proposed public listing of the defendant company. They alleged that the plaintiff had offered to find a shell company for any interested party on a commission basis. The plaintiff was acting basically as a broker though he did, in addition, give the defendants/TK Low the benefit of his expertise in relation to the accounts of the various companies which were presented as possible candidates for purchase.
TK Low's testimony formed the core of the defence on this aspect. He stated that the plaintiff had told him that money could be made through the purchase of a Hong Kong shell company. The possibility interested him not only for himself but also for the defendants. His understanding with the plaintiff was that if a shell company was acquired, the plaintiff would be paid 1% of the acquisition amount as a finder's fee. Otherwise, no payment would be due to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's disbursements would however be paid for. TK Low stated (and the plaintiff agreed) that in fact all the plaintiff's airfares, hotel charges and other disbursements incurred by the plaintiff while looking for a shell company were paid for by either the defendant company or TK Low personally. In TK Low's opinion, this was a fair deal as the plaintiff had contributed his time to the search for the shell company. He testified that pursuant to this arrangement, various meetings were arranged by the plaintiff in Hong Kong with bankers and other business people which he had attended. In the end the shell company search was fruitless and thus the plaintiff was not entitled to any remuneration.
KW Low testified that he did not instruct the plaintiff to go to Hong Kong to buy a shell company in 1985. He was aware that the plaintiff looked for a shell company in Hong Kong in 1985 with TK Low. The plaintiff was often in Hong Kong with TK Low during that year and little feedback was given to KW Low. KW Low was also involved in some meetings in Hong Kong in connection proposed acquisitions. In his evidence, except in regard to a company known as Shine Construction, his presence at the various discussions was because he happened to be in Hong Kong at the time and not because he had initiated the meetings. He gave no evidence on the terms on which the plaintiff was working in connection with the shell company search.
Was the shell company operation part of the listing contract? The contract between the plaintiff and the defendants as established by the plaintiff was ""to prepare the defendants for public listing"". Did this contract encompass the acquisition of a shell company in Hong Kong? In my judgment, it did not. The defendants' main interest and concern in 1984/85 as expressed by KW Low according to the plaintiff's own testimony were to go for a public listing in Singapore of the defendant company. This is also supported by the evidence that the defendants had asked two merchant banks to look into the issue. The discussions with SIMBL were serious enough for SIMBL to prepare two preliminary reports for the defendants' consideration. At the time that the plaintiff was entrusted with the job of preparing the defendants for a listing, the emphasis was on Singapore. An indirect listing on a foreign stock exchange through the acquisition of a foreign company was not contemplated.
The plaintiff himself admitted that it was his suggestion to acquire a Hong Kong company, a suggestion made one year after his initial appointment. In his testimony, he endeavoured to convince the court that this suggestion was made as a solution to problems encountered in Singapore. That assertion was however contradicted by a letter which the plaintiff wrote to TK Low personally on 27 December 1984. In this letter the plaintiff said that he had been advised of the availability of a publicly listed company in Hong Kong which had been offered as a shell with a public listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He further stated: ""We shall be grateful if you would let us know whether you or perhaps your friends would be interested to purchase it."" It would be noted that the offer was made not only to TK Low but also to his friends. The plaintiff did not offer a shell company as an alternative form of listing for the defendants. He offered it as an investment pure and simple.
It is also significant that in the search for a suitable Hong Kong company, the plaintiff worked with and reported to TK Low rather than KW Low, the defendants' managing director and the person who had originally appointed him to oversee the listing operation. If the shell company operation had been intended as part of the listing, KW Low would have played a much bigger part therein.
Accordingly, I am unable to find that the work done in connection with the acquisition of a shell company was part of the contract for listing. I am also unable to find that work which the plaintiff undoubtedly did in relation to the shell company transaction was work that was to be paid for on the basis of a reasonable remuneration. At an early meeting with TK Low, the plaintiff had told him that he charged 1% for sale and acquisition of companies. TK Low accepted this as the market price for such deals. A situation where one person is acting as a procurer of an asset for purchase by another is a common situation in which it is accepted that payment depends upon success. It is an entire rather than a severable contractual obligation. As the plaintiff's efforts were, for one reason or another, fruitless, he is not entitled to payment.
Shine Construction There is however one acquisition transaction where the plaintiff is entitled to payment. That is in relation to the Hong Kong company called Shine Construction. The negotiations relating to this company were not part of the shell company operation. According to KW Low's testimony which I accept, a Singapore architect introduced him to Shine Construction as a possible investment in Hong Kong. KW Low asked the plaintiff who was then in Hong Kong to examine whether the company was a worthwhile investment. The plaintiff accordingly attended a meeting with KW Low at which Shine Construction's directors and accountants were present. According to KW Low, Shine Construction's accountants were unable to answer the plaintiff's questions on their accounts or to supply him information which he needed. Accordingly he later advised KW Low not to pursue the investment. This advice was taken. The defendant company subsequently paid bills rendered by the plaintiff for disbursements incurred in travelling to and staying in Hong Kong for meetings relating to Shine Construction.
According to the plaintiff's own evidence, some portion of the time he spent in Hong Kong in May and July 1985 was spent on meetings concerning Shine Construction. It is impossible however to quantify how much time was taken for this purpose.
On the basis of what KW Low said however, the plaintiff is entitled to remuneration for that time. He was a professional asked to give professional advice. He was not playing a broker's role in relation to Shine Construction. The circumstances were such that he could not have been expected to work for free. KW Low was fully aware of that. During his testimony in relation to this matter, he said that if the plaintiff had billed him for work done in respect of Shine Construction, he would have paid the plaintiff. Doing the best I can in the absence of any evidence on the amount of work the plaintiff actually did for the Shine Construction venture, I award him $1,500.
(b) Mawan Harbour and joint venture with Nanhai Oil Shenzen Development and Services Corporation Mawan Harbour is located in the Shenzen Economic Zone in Southern China. In 1984, the Chinese authorities were interested in developing a container port at Mawan Harbour. This project was brought to TK Low by a friend who knew that TK Low had done a lot of harbour construction work in Indonesia. TK Low made several trips to China in connection with the project together with his friend, Professor Hou Ke Hwa, an engineer with whom he had worked on previous construction projects. Eventually the Chinese informed TK Low that they wanted to create a joint venture company with the defendants to finance, construct and operate the project. At that stage TK Low asked Professor Hou to prepare a preliminary feasibility study. By that time too, the defendants had agreed to undertake the project and had given TK Low full responsibility for it.
According to his evidence, the plaintiff first became involved with Mawan in July 1985 when he received instructions on the telephone from TK Low to prepare to travel to Hong Kong in connection with the defendants' bid for a construction project in China. Thereafter, the plaintiff went to Hong Kong on several occasions in connection with the Mawan project. The plaintiff was, on his testimony, trying to arrange finance for the defendants to assist them in the project. The defendants' calculation was that the project would cost in the region of US$200 million and they needed to raise at least US$100 million in loan funds. The plaintiff had long meetings and discussions with various banks but primarily with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in his efforts to raise funds for the defendants. He also made approaches to Hutchison Whampoa who ran, through a related company, the Hong Kong Container Port. His aim in so doing was to promote a joint venture between the defendants and the Hutchison group for the development of Mawan Port. Eventually the defendants were awarded a contract to develop Mawan Port but the plaintiff was unable to secure any financing for them or to involve Hutchison Whampoa in the project.
The plaintiff says he spent 555 hours between 4 July 1985 and 21 November 1985 on meetings, preparation and review of documents and other work related to the Mawan project. Among the things which the plaintiff did was to prepare at short notice a ""feasibility study"" on the project for TK Low to take into China with him for the purpose of his negotiations with the Chinese parties. He also reviewed two feasibility studies prepared by Professor Hou, attempted to translate into English a joint venture agreement prepared by the defendants' Chinese partners and worked with one Dr Ong, an engineer, on another feasibility study for the project. He claimed payment for all time spent.
The defendants' position as enunciated by TK Low was that the plaintiff's involvement in the Mawan project was entirely his own doing. The plaintiff became aware of the existence of the project in the course of his dealings with the defendants. He volunteered to raise funds for the project on the basis that he would be paid a fee of 1% of the loan procured. TK Low was amenable to this offer. He had already made arrangements with Marubeni Corporation for them to provide financing but he was open to alternative arrangements which would be more beneficial to the defendants than the conditions laid down by Marubeni Corporation. He therefore accepted the plaintiff's participation and attended meetings with such bankers as the plaintiff required him to. However, as the plaintiff did not procure any loans, the plaintiff did not earn any fees. My conclusion after analysing the evidence before the court, is that the defendants' position on the plaintiff's role in the Mawan project is more credible than that of the plaintiff. The defendant company was experienced in the construction business. TK Low himself through his business in Indonesia had been involved in many harbour construction projects. He had the expertise and the back-up needed for such projects. Not only could he call upon the knowledge and assistance of Professor Hou, a consulting engineer but he also had access to the services of M/s Posford Pavry & Partners, an English firm of consultant engineers. In relation to the Mawan project, Professor Hou produced both a preliminary and a final feasibility study and Posford Pavry & Partners in association with Technecon Transport Economists produced a 74 page (excluding the appendices, exhibits and photographs) Financial and Engineering Feasibility Report.
On the other hand, the plaintiff had no natural role to play in this project. He was not an engineer. He knew nothing about constructing or operating a harbour. He could not speak Mandarin. Finally, as a Malaysian citizen, he was unable to enter China to help TK Low with the negotiations. There was no need at all for the defendants to use the plaintiff's services in connection with Mawan.
The plaintiff was unable to support his position by reference to documents. He relied on several telexes which he sent to Hong Kong Bank, to the Bank of China, to various other banks for bankers' references and to Hutchison Whampoa and its related company running the Hong Kong Container Port, as support for his contentions. These documents are however neutral. They do not establish the plaintiff's capacity even though in many of them, he described himself as a special assistant to TK Low. TK Low's response to that was he was quite content for the plaintiff to describe himself as he pleased as the description did not harm the defendants. The amount of weight that should be given to this description can also be gauged by the fact that the plaintiff erroneously described TK Low in such telexes as the managing director of the defendant company though he was well aware of TK Low's actual status.
The defence contention was strengthened by a document entitled ""Discussion draft proposal on the construction of the Mawan Harbour and Terminal, Shenzen, S.E.Z. People's Republic of China"", prepared by the plaintiff himself in Hong Kong in August 1985. At that stage Professor Hou had already prepared a preliminary feasibility study which the plaintiff considered to be flawed because it assumed a pay-back period in excess of 16 years whereas the banks the plaintiff had been dealing with expected to be repaid in 10 years. Secondly, the study assumed that there would be a spill over of business from the Hong Kong port to Mawan an assumption the plaintiff challenged. According to the plaintiff, his criticisms of Professor Hou's report were accepted by TK Low and he was asked to prepare a substitute feasibility study for discussion with the Chinese.
When the plaintiff's document is analysed, however, it appears to be a paper addressed to a potential financier rather than to a proposed joint venture partner. For example, the very first line of the document says: ""The name of the proposed Borrower shall be ....."". Then after the third paragraph there is sub-heading reading: ""Type and currency of arranging"" (sic) and the first line after this sub-heading reads: ""The proposed type of financing shall be US$ fixed rate borrowing...."". The paragraph goes on to state that arrangements for the syndication of the borrowing shall be mandated to the Sum Cheong Group of Singapore and that the maturity period of the loan shall be 10 years plus an additional period of grace. Other sub-headings in the document include the following: ""Purpose of the Loan"", ""Amount of the Borrowing and Estimated Allocations"", ""Expected Income"", ""Loan Repayment and Foreign Exchange"" and ""Taxation"". There is no engineering input in the document at all and the business input is minimal. A lot of the information required was indicated only in outline. It is impossible to believe that this document could have been intended for presentation to the Chinese partners as a basis for agreement.
When TK Low went into China to negotiate in August 1985, the plaintiff could not accompany him. He spent his time in Hong Kong liaising between TK Low and the latter's offices in Singapore and Indonesia. He further testified that he travelled to see Castle Peak Power Station in Hong Kong to assess shipping traffic between the power station and the Hong Kong International Container Terminal. He also spent time visiting and studying the Kowloon Railway System because the Mawan project involved the establishment of a railway system. To quote the plaintiff, he ""wanted to understand the economics of transport systems involving sea, road and railway in a rocky terrain."" That the plaintiff thought such activities could serve a useful purpose or give him reliable information shows his true position at the margins of the project.
The plaintiff's testimony that in October 1985 he was asked again to produce a feasibility study is again unbelievable. By that time, Professor Hou's second report had been produced and a draft contract had been signed between the defendant company and Nanhai Oil Shenzen Development and Services Corporation. What was needed was the full scale professional feasibility study which the defendants commissioned Posford Pavry & Partners to prepare. As the plaintiff himself admitted, his attempts at a second feasibility study, even though undertaken in conjunction with an engineer, were even less successful than the first effort as not even a draft resulted. Finally, the plaintiff's contention that the defendants commissioned him, a non-Mandarin speaker, to translate the draft joint venture agreement between themselves and the Chinese into English is incredible. It is much more likely that it was the plaintiff's own idea to translate this document cheaply with the assistance of his wife so that he would have something to show to the banks from whom he was attempting to obtain financing for the defendants.
The plaintiff also sought to contend that his work on the Mawan project formed part of his contract for listing the defendants. His explanation was that if the project came to fruition it would be injected into the defendant company in order to meet the Stock Exchange of Singapore's criteria of product, geographical and income diversification. The defendants would have a steady source of income for many years to come and would have assets of undoubted quality to be included in their financial statements. He testified that income from utilities is prized for its stability and assured growth and such income would help the defendants to be regarded as a blue chip company.
Mr Ma was asked his opinion on the above. He stated that if the Mawan project was the largest project to be undertaken by the defendant company and the success of the company was dependant on the success of the project, then the Mawan project would not assist the company in overcoming the objection of being over-dependant on a single customer or business. Secondly, a feasibility study on such a project would, he said, be based on a lot of assumptions. The most important ones would relate to the ability of the Chinese partners to perform and to receive the necessary approvals. This would be more important than the academic conclusions in the report. Mr Ma was not convinced that the Mawan project added to the chances of the defendants being successful in a listing application.
It is my finding that the Mawan project was completely separate from the listing exercise. It was not contemplated when the exercise was embarked upon. It was a business opportunity that arose later. There was no intention at the time that the plaintiff was appointed to oversee the listing that he should be involved in the defendants' bids for work. He was supposed to re-organise and restructure the defendants and their group. The plaintiff was employed for his accounting skills and corporate advice and the Mawan project fell outside the scope of his duties.
In the event, this portion of the plaintiff's claim must fail.
(c) Xiamen Harbour The next portion of the second bill relates to four and a half hours that the plaintiff spent on studying documents and advising KW Low on the feasibility of the defendants participating in the development of the port of Xiamen, China.
According to the plaintiff, on 23 October 1985, KW Low gave the plaintiff various documents to study on the Xiamen port and asked for his advice. After the plaintiff had perused the documents, he met KW Low again and recommended that the project be abandoned. KW Low agreed and no further work was done. The documents which KW Low handed the plaintiff were exhibited as PB1369 - 1413 of the plaintiff's bundle.
KW Low on the other hand had no memory of the plaintiff's involvement in this project at all. He did not remember the documents PB1369 - 1413 either. He recalled the project as having been a joint venture between the Port of Singapore Authority and the defendants. Thus he denied the plaintiff had done any work on this matter.
I accept the plaintiff's evidence. How else would the plaintiff have obtained the documents? KW Low must have suffered a lapse of memory as the events occurred more than six years ago and the plaintiff's involvement was very brief. I award the plaintiff $400 for this work.
(d) Wuhan Project The fourth item in the second bill which I must deal with relates to the 11 hours claimed by the plaintiff in respect of work done in relation to the proposed construction and operation of a hotel in Wuhan, China.
The plaintiff testified that on 25 September 1985, he received instructions from KW Low to attend a meeting with two gentlemen who represented a company which was promoting the Wuhan Hotel. They brought with them a feasibility study which was given to the plaintiff to analyse and to report on to KW Low. The plaintiff's role was to assess the suitability of the investment. This meeting was held in the defendants' board room in Singapore and KW Low was present.
After the meeting, the plaintiff studied the feasibility study. He concluded that the study was too optimistic. On the 27 September 1985 he had another meeting on the Wuhan project with KW Low and other director of the defendants. At this second meeting, the plaintiff advised that the hotel was not suitable as an investment for the defendants at that stage because of its impact on the defendants' cash flow. KW Low was still interested in the project but the plaintiff's involvement ended there.
KW Low also testified on the Wuhan project. His stand was that the Wuhan project was his personal project rather than the defendant company's. He gave evidence that he was approached as a potential investor in the project. He also stated that he did in fact become an investor and the investment is continuing. He confirmed that the plaintiff came to his office to have a discussion with the two gentlemen who were promoting the project in order to help him determine whether it was a feasible investment. After the discussion, the plaintiff's advice had been not to proceed with the investment as the returns would take a long time. Thereafter the plaintiff was no longer involved. KW Low did not take the plaintiff's advice. Neither did he expect the plaintiff to send a bill for the advice. He thought it was friendly advice as the discussion took only three hours and at the end of it the plaintiff rejected the project. KW Low's attitude seems to be that the plaintiff should only bill if something had resulted from the discussions. He also stated however that if a bill had been presented he would have paid it personally. Under cross-examination, KW Low confirmed that he had not informed the plaintiff that the Wuhan project was his personal project. He asserted however that the plaintiff was aware of this fact.
On the foregoing evidence, I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to remuneration in respect of his work for the Wuhan project. At all material times, the plaintiff dealt with KW Low in his capacity as managing director of the defendant company. No evidence was given of any work done by the plaintiff as personal work for KW Low. Further all meetings relating to the investment took place in the defendants' office. As KW Low did not inform the plaintiff that the Wuhan project was his personal investment, he was, in the circumstances of the plaintiff's relationship with the defendants, making a representation that the work to be done was work for the defendants. The defendants are bound by this representation on the part of their managing director.
There was some conflict of evidence as to the extent of the plaintiff's involvement in Wuhan as KW Low asserted this was limited to one meeting. KW Low's memory was not, however, very good in relation to matters of detail and he did not keep notes of time spent unlike the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff's recollection of the time involved and the number of meetings attended is likely to be more accurate than that of KW Low.
I award the plaintiff $800 for his work on the Wuhan project.
(e) Other work Apart from the specific items (a) to (f) in the bill as described earlier, the second bill also contained a description of various activities which the plaintiff allegedly undertook on behalf of the defendants. In his evidence, the plaintiff did not attempt to justify these items as separate work for which payment should be made. Instead where evidence was led on work which would fall within the descriptions in the bill, the plaintiff's stand was that such work related to items (a) to (f). Accordingly, there is no need for me to deal separately with the other work described.
Before I turn to the last two bills, it should be noted that the first two bills included disbursement claims of $750 and $500 respectively. No evidence was led on the disbursements incurred by the plaintiff which made up the said sums of $750 and $500. I am, accordingly, unable to make any award in respect thereof.
III. Bill for $10,000 dated 1 May 1987
On 28 May 1985 the plaintiff received a memorandum dated 27 May 1985. It was stated as being from TK Low and under his name there appeared in printed form the name and address of the defendant company. The memorandum was short. It stated ""Kindly study the enclosed balance sheet of Exklusiv Auto Pte Ltd and advise me according"" (sic) and was signed by TK Low.
The plaintiff testified that he spent some 62 hours thereafter working on this assignment which related to the proposed acquisition of shares in a Singapore company, Exklusiv Auto Pte Ltd (""Exklusiv Auto""), which had the agency for Renault cars. He not only perused the balance sheet but also met several times with the owner of Exklusiv Auto, one Mr Peter Kwee, and his accountant to clarify items in the documents. A written report was given directly to TK Low advising against the investment. The plaintiff asserted that the purpose of this work was to assess the suitability of Exklusiv Auto for inclusion in the listing group to meet the criteria of geographical and customer diversification.
TK Low's position was straight forward: Exklusiv Auto was not connected with the defendant company but was his personal matter. He stated that Mr Peter Kwee, was his school mate. When Peter Kwee had some financing problems with his business, he had gone to TK Low for help. He wanted TK Low to go into Exklusiv Auto as a shareholder. In the end TK Low did not invest but he helped Mr Kwee by lending him the money. On receipt of Exklusiv Auto's papers, TK Low had sent them to the plaintiff as he wanted his advice on whether it was a good company. The plaintiff had told him that the company was not a good one and as TK Low was not in that line of business, he should not get involved. KW Low's testimony was that the work in respect of Exklusiv Auto was not done for the defendants.
Under cross-examination, the plaintiff stated that he was aware that Peter Kwee was a former classmate and a personal friend of TK Low. He also knew that Peter Kwee had offered the opportunity of buying over Exklusiv Auto to TK Low personally. He however asserted that in answer to a question he had put to TK Low, TK Low had informed the plaintiff that he intended to pass on this opportunity to the defendants.
In assessing the evidence I had to bear in mind that it was the plaintiff who had to show that the instructions on Exklusiv Auto originated from the defendants.
I hold the plaintiff has not proved that the work he did in respect of Exklusiv Auto was done for the defendants. That the instructions were written on a memorandum of the defendants was incidental and did not prove they emanated from the defendant company. It is interesting to note here that in relation to the final bill where the initial instructions came on a memorandum from P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia, the plaintiff was easily able to overlook that small detail and assert his instructions came from the defendants rather than P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia. In fact the instructions here came from TK Low. The investment was one offered to TK Low personally. Even if TK Low intended to pass on the investment to the defendants at a subsequent date, there was no evidence that he had done so at the time the plaintiff was instructed to carry out the work. The plaintiff's task was a necessary preliminary to deciding on the investment and it was a task which TK Low personally wanted to plaintiff to carry out.
The fact that TK Low was also a director of the defendants does not mean that every instruction he gave to the plaintiff was an instruction on behalf of the defendant company especially when such instruction did not relate to the type of work in which the defendants were involved. Also KW Low, the managing director of the defendants, knew nothing about this investment. Finally, as pointed out earlier, the plaintiff sent his advice to TK Low personally. No copy thereof was forwarded to KW Low.
TK Low did give some questionable testimony in relation to this bill. In court he stated that the plaintiff did not tell him that the plaintiff would not bill for Exklusiv Auto. TK Low had assumed from the circumstances that the plaintiff would not bill. He thought the plaintiff would do it as a favour as he had given the plaintiff pocket money from time to time. In an affidavit filed in these proceedings however, TK Low had stated that the plaintiff had specifically told him that the plaintiff would not bill for Exklusiv Auto. The plaintiff's reason was that the amount involved was small. TK Low was unable to explain the discrepancy in the evidence. In my judgment however, this inconsistency does not help the plaintiff prove that in fact the work was done for the defendant company. For the reasons stated earlier, I hold the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proof in this regard.
IV. Bill for $5,000 dated 1 May 1987
This last bill relates to work on yet another project in China. This time it was the Tianjin Sheraton Hotel and Convention Centre (""the Tianjin Hotel""). The plaintiff allegedly spent 43 1/2 hours of his time on this project.
According to the plaintiff, in May 1986, he received a memorandum dated 1 May 1986 on the letterhead of P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia. The memorandum referred to an ""enclosed"" feasibility study and telexes relating to the Tianjin Hotel and asked the plaintiff to ""kindly study and advise your comments on the feasibility of this project"". It further stated ""I need to have your comments very soon"". It was signed by TK Low.
The documents forwarded to the plaintiff comprised two feasibility studies, telexes and letters addressed to TK Low at P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia and some other correspondence. All in all, they came to some 122 pages.
The plaintiff testified that he studied the documents, sent a written report thereon to TK Low and, at TK Low's request, had a meeting with the representative of the promoters of the project. In support of his contention that all this work was done for the defendants, the plaintiff testified that TK Low had told him that the project was the defendants' project. He was also told that the project was directly connected to the defendants' listing. In the report which the plaintiff gave TK Low there is mention of a loan to be provided by TK Low personally and a sum of US$6 million to be provided by the defendants in cash or by way of a guarantee. The plaintiff's comment was that if such a guarantee were given, it would seriously restrict the defendants' credit rating for the next 13 to 15 years and he therefore advised against the investment.
The defendants' case was that the Tianjin Hotel project was not their project and they had not commissioned the plaintiff's work. TK Low's testimony was that the project was brought to him by an American friend who sent him the relevant documents to ascertain whether he was interested in participating in it. The suggestion was that his participation should be by way of a loan of US$6 million to Gateway Development Corporation, the United States joint venture corporation developing the project. TK Low confirmed that he had written the memorandum to the plaintiff in order to assist the plaintiff in obtaining the documents on the project. According to TK Low, the plaintiff knew about the project from seeing the documents in TK Low's office in Singapore and he had volunteered his assistance. At that time TK Low had not decided who should participate in this project. It could have been the defendant company, P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia or TK Low himself. KW Low who was still the managing director of the defendants in May 1986 testified that he knew nothing about the Tianjin Hotel project. This testimony was not challenged in cross examination.
The burden is on the plaintiff to prove that the work he did was work requested by the defendants. In my judgment he has not discharged this burden in relation to the Tianjin Hotel project. Although I did not believe TK Low's statement that the plaintiff was a volunteer in relation to this work as his court testimony on how the work came to be done by the plaintiff was inconsistent with the contents of an affidavit previously made by him, this does not mean that I have to discard all TK Low's evidence on the transaction. It is the plaintiff's obligation to persuade me that on the balance of probabilities the work was done for the defendants and no one else. Apart from the plaintiff's assertion to that effect, there is no support for his contention.
From the correspondence which was included in the bundle of documents relating to this project, it is clear that the offer to participate in the project was made directly to TK Low. The defendant company was only mentioned once in all the letters. The type of investment asked for would not naturally involve the plaintiff as it was an infusion of loan capital rather than active participation in the construction of the project. It was an investment that could well have been made by any of the parties mentioned by TK Low. Further, the plaintiff was aware that TK Low had other business interests besides the defendant company and that in fact he was actively running P.T. Jaya Sumpiles Indonesia. In the circumstances, it behoved the plaintiff to take steps to ascertain for whom he was working. Secondly, the work could not have been part of the listing contract as by May 1986 the direct listing of the defendants in Singapore was no longer being actively pursued. As the plaintiff himself testified, by March 1986 another important deadline in regard to the listing had passed. His evidence shows that thereafter no work was done on the listing apart from the preparation of a report on the problems and irregularities in Malaysia.
In the circumstances, the plaintiff's claim in respect of this bill fails completely.
Conclusion
In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff for a total sum of $32,700 with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from 15 May 1987 (the plaintiff sent the bills to the defendants on 14 May 1987).

Earnest Lau, DJ:
Brief facts
1.         The Plaintiff is a family-run company. On 19 July 2003, they obtained a judgment in DC Suit No. 530 of 2003 against Chuang Ye Engineering Pte Ltd (“the company”) for $153,457. At all material times, the Defendant was the director of the company. The judgment proved fruitless for the Plaintiff as the company was unable to pay the sums owed. Sometime in August 2003, the Plaintiff offered the company to pay just $80,000 to settle the judgment debt on condition that the Defendant execute a personal guarantee. A draft deed of guarantee was prepared by Ms Pang Li Yen (“Pang”) (PW2), a qualified accountant and daughter of the Plaintiff’s director Mdm Koh Hwee Kheng (“Koh) (PW1). The Defendant refused to sign the deed of guarantee.
2.         In November 2003, the Plaintiff commenced execution proceedings against the company under a Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS).
3.         In December 2003, the Plaintiff negotiated with the Defendant to let the company pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004 as a full and final settlement of the judgment debt. This is contained in a letter from the Plaintiff to the company dated 22/12/2003 (“the Letter”). As a result the Plaintiff did not proceed with the WSS against the company.
4.         Unfortunately, the company failed to make payment as agreed in the Letter.  Then sometime in April 2004, the Plaintiff saw a notice in the newspapers that a winding up petition had been made against the company. They then instructed solicitors to send a letter of demand against the Defendant seeking payment of $153,457 on grounds that he was personally liable for the judgment debt. The Defendant, however, denied all liability.
5.         As a result, the Plaintiff brought in these proceedings an action against the Defendant to recover a debt of $153,457 being monies due and owing on a personal guarantee. The Statement of Claim pleaded an agreement existing between the Plaintiff and Defendant that should the company fail to pay $75,000 by 28/2/2004 in full and final settlement of the judgment debt, the Defendant would pay to Plaintiff the entire judgment debt of $153,457. It was further pleaded that this agreement is evidenced in the Letter.
6.         At the conclusion of trial, the respective parties summed up their cases as follows:
(a)        The Defendant maintained that the compromise agreement in the Letter had been unilaterally offered by the Plaintiff who did not demand any security in return. In addition to the terms expressed in the Letter, the Plaintiff further allowed the company to take its time to pay the compromised sums by instalments. Throughout the negotiations, the Defendant had always told Pang that he did not wish to be personally liable for the judgment debt. This was why he refused to sign the deed of guarantee prepared in August 2003. He even informed Pang and Koh he was prepared to let the company be liquidated. At no time did he ever assume personal liability. If he intended to be personally liable, he would have signed the deed guarantee. He also raised the point that the Letter does not contain terms imputing personal liability on him. All this is consistent with the fact that Pang never used the words “personal guarantee” when she drafted the Letter, in contrast with the earlier deed of guarantee which she prepared. Moreover, the Plaintiff never sent any letter of demand to the Defendant when the company failed to pay on 29 February 2004. The Plaintiff only served a letter of demand to the Defendant 2-3 months later when the company was threatened with liquidation proceedings.
(b)        The Plaintiff, on the other hand, held that in all oral negotiations with the Defendant, Pang and Koh had insisted on a personal guarantee. This was why the Plaintiff offered to reduce the judgment debt from $153,457 to $75,000, postpone the Writ of Seizure and Sale and grant an extension of time to the company to pay. The Defendant’s version of the agreement is completely untrue. There is no agreement or evidence to show that the company was allowed to pay the compromised sums by instalments or to pay as and when it could afford to do so. The Defendant lied because he knew he was personally liable. He agreed to be personally liable because he was confident that by 29 February 2004 the company would have collected money on its business projects. The Letter clearly contains a personal guarantee and at all times, he understood the meaning of the Letter because the subject of guarantee was brought up at the meeting prior to the signing of the letter.
7.         On the outset, let me emphasise that the trial court can only look at the issues raised in the pleadings and no other: see 
Multi-Pak  Singapore v Intraco 
[1992] 2 SLR 793
.
 The Plaintiff has framed their case on the existence of an agreement by the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff $153,457 if the company fails to pay $75,000 by 29 February 2004. I therefore am confined to the task of ascertaining whether the Plaintiff has proven the agreement as pleaded. After considering the facts, I found no such agreement exists.
The law
8.         It is trite law that the court adopts an objective test in discerning the existence of such an agreement: 
Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd 
[1999] 3 SLR 1
; Gema Metal Ceilings (Far East) Pte Ltd v Iwatani Techno Construction (M) Sdn Bhd 
[2000] SGHC 37
.  In other words, the court must decide whether the Letter when read objectively discloses the agreement as the Plaintiff has pleaded. The court cannot be concerned with what the parties may have believed.
(a)       The classic formulation of the principle was stated by Blackburn J in 
Smith v Hughes
 
(1871) LR 6 QB 597
 as follows:
If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a 
reasonable man 
would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the 
contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.
(b)        In SAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Teck Koon (Motor) Trading (a firm) 
[1998] 2 SLR 325
,
 the Court of Appeal  quoted this passage from R v Lord Chancellor`s Department, 
ex parte Nangle 
[1991] ICR 743
 at page 751 with approval:
[I]n our judgment, that the question whether there is an intention to create legal relations is to be ascertained objectively, and where the terms of the relationship are, as here, to be derived solely from the documents, depends upon the construction of those documents. It is possible for a party to believe mistakenly that he is contractually bound to another when in fact he is not; and conversely to believe that he is not when he is. His belief is immaterial. While this remains a subjective belief uncommunicated to the other party, this is plainly correct. But where such a belief is expressed in the documents it must be a question of construction of the documents as a whole what effect should be given to such a statement.
(c)        The contemporaneous conduct of the parties, in addition to documents, can and should also be taken into account in order to determine the existence of an agreement between the parties: see 
Harvey v Johnson (1848) 6 CB 305; Brogden v Metropolitan Railway 
(1877) 2 App Cas 666
.
9.         The main plank of the Plaintiff’s case rests on the proper construction of the Letter. I note the following from this Letter:
(a)        The Letter was dispatched on the Plaintiff’s letterhead and addressed to the company at its place of business “No. 22 Woodlands link #03-09/10 Singapore 738734”. Reproduced below are the terms found in the Letter:
It was agreed that:-
The sum of S$75,000 is to be the full and final settlement of the judgment entered against (sic) on the 19
th
 July 2003 on the condition that the agreed discounted value will be satisfied by one payment to be furnished before 
31
st
 January
 (29 February – handwritten and signed) 2004;
In the event of any default in payment, all outstanding balance sum under the judgment entered against you on 19
th
 July shall be come due and payable immediately and we shall be entitled to enforce the judgment;
Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 1 & 2of the agreement the full sum may be repayable at any time prior to 31
st
 January 2004; and
Upon receipt of full payment, Chuang Ye Engineering Pte Ltd is allowed to file the consent to entry of satisfaction within 14 days.
Yours faithfully

Mr Tan Kah Loo (Director)
Chuang Ye Engineering Pte Ltd
(b)        On a plain and unstrained reading I cannot objectively say that the Letter imposes on the Defendant a personal liability to pay $153,437 on the company’s default. Even if one argues from the final paragraph of the Letter that the Defendant has somehow bound himself the 
“terms and conditions as set out above”
, it begs the question: what is he bound to? Clause 1 only obliges him to ensure that the company pays $75,000 by 29/2/2004. It is further evident the liability to pay the judgment sum on default only falls on the company and not the Defendant. And even if I consider the terms of the Letter ambiguous (which I do not), the rules of construction require me to resolve any ambiguity in meaning against the Plaintiff who prepared the document: see 
Edis v Bury
 
108 ER 511
.
(c)        Moreover Pang and Koh’s affidavits only deposed to the fact that a personal undertaking was given without condescending to the terms and particulars of the oral discussions which allegedly preceded the signing of the Letter. At cross examination, Pang displayed uncertainty as to whether the Defendant agreed to be personally liable for the full judgment debt against the company or only the compromised sums.
Ct:        Who was supposed to pay $75,000? Company or him (the Defendant)?
PLY:    If the company does not pay, he will pay.
Ct:        Tell me what you thought was the agreement i.e. that the company was to pay $75,000 in a lump sum by 29/2/2004, and if the company fails to pay, the Defendant will pay; or simply, the Defendant will pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004?
PLY:    Company to pay. If the company cannot pay $75,000, he will pay.
(d)        It was only on re-examination that Pang maintained the Defendant was personally liable to pay the entire judgment sum:
P/C:      You said that the agreement was that if the company does not pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004, the Defendant will pay and be liable. Clarify this statement in view of clause 2 of PA 69. He will pay what sum?
PLY:    $153,000 if the company does not pay $75,000. If the company does not pay $75,000, he will be personally liable for $153,000 which is the judgment debt.
10.       In the circumstances, I did not think the Letter sufficiently expressed the intentions of Pang and Koh to affix the Defendant with personal liability for the entire judgment sum. I also note that Pang had previously drafted a deed of guarantee in August 2003 which clearly spelt out the Defendant’s liability for the judgment debt.  The fact that she omitted to do so in the Letter militates strongly against the Plaintiff’s case. This could well be an oversight on her part, but as I have already pointed out, the objective test does not allow me to look into private thoughts but at published words and conduct.
Another agreement ?
11.       Although the Plaintiff could not discharge their burden on the pleaded case, the evidence, however, suggests there to be another collateral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  I only mention this for the sake of completeness. I am mindful that the Plaintiff has only chosen to sue on the agreement as appears in their Statement of Claim i.e. a guarantee for $153,457. There is no other prayer for relief on an alternative agreement, thus precluding any award in favour of the Plaintiff.  My finding here is based on the law enunciated in 
Moschi v Lep Air Services 
[1973] AC 331
 which was applied in 
Tan Hock Keng v L and M Group Investments Ltd 2001] 4 SLR 428 (High Ct); 
[2002] 2 SLR 213
 (CA).
 In the 
Moschi
 
 
 case, the House of Lords discussed of the nature of the obligation of a guarantee. Most pertinent were the observations of Lord Reid who distinguished between two types of guarantee obligations: see 
Moschi 
[1973] AC 331
 at 344–345.
With regard to making good to the creditor payments of instalments by the principal debtor there are at least two possible forms of agreement. A person might undertake no more than if the principal debtor fails to pay any instalment he will pay it. That would be a conditional agreement. There would be no prestable obligation unless and until the debtor failed to pay. There would then on the debtor’s failure arise an obligation to pay. If for any reason the debtor ceased to have any obligation to pay the instalment on the due date then he could not fail to pay it on that date. The condition attached to the undertaking would never be purified and the subsidiary obligation would never arise. On the other hand, the guarantor’s obligation might be of a different kind. He might undertake that the principal debtor will carry out his contract. Then if at any time and if for any reason the principal debtor acts or fails to act as required by his contract, he not only breaks his own contract but also puts the guarantor in breach of his contract of guarantee. Then the creditor can sue the guarantor, not for the unpaid instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal debtor would carry out the principal contract, the damages payable by the guarantor must then be the loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor having failed to do what the guarantor undertook that he would do.
12.       The first description corresponds with the type of guarantee pleaded by the Plaintiff i.e. where the guarantor is liable for same debt that the principal debtor is liable for. It matters not if that debt is an outstanding instalment payment or the full sum outstanding. The important point to note is that the guarantor has undertaken to pay an agreed liquidated sum on the default of the principal debtor.
13.       The second type of guarantee described by Lord Reid fits the facts of our case. It is one where the guarantor has undertaken to ensure that the principal debtor performs his payment obligation. Here, the guarantor makes a separately enforceable collateral agreement with the creditor who gives consideration by entering into the compromise agreement with the principal debtor. The guarantor’s liability lies in damages in the event of a breach of compromise agreement by the principal debtor. In my opinion, the evidence in our case supports the presence of this guarantee obligation.       
(a)        In the course of proceedings, Koh and Pang have consistently maintained that they secured the Defendant’s “personal undertaking” in the course of negotiations – notably at a meeting dated 19/12/2003.  This was against the backdrop of a prior attempt by the Plaintiff to secure the Defendant’s personal guarantee in August 2003 and the postponed execution proceedings against the company. Crucially, the Defendant himself admitted in his affidavit at paragraph 13 that he had agreed to do his best to get the company to pay by 31/1/04.    I have also mentioned earlier that Clause 1 of the Letter can be read to oblige the Defendant to ensure the due payment by the company.
(b)        Between the Pang and Koh’s assertions and Defendant’s rejection of personal liability, I chose to believe the Plaintiff witnesses. To me the Defendant’s account of events was unbelievable by any objective standard. He testified that the Plaintiff voluntarily withdrew execution proceedings against the company; voluntarily reduced the original compromise sum from $80,000 top $75,000; and generously allowed the company to pay as and when it could, granting all these concessions without demanding anything in return from the company or the Defendant. These answers defy commercial and common sense. Moreover, the Defendant behaved evasively as a witness often contradicting himself on numerous occasions.
(c)        Thus on the balance of probabilities, I am inclined to find that the Defendant personally undertook the prompt repayment of the compromised sums by the company. This collateral agreement in my view exists coterminously with the main compromise agreement reached between the Plaintiff and the company, and is one where the Plaintiff is entitled to seek damages against the Defendant on the failure of the company to pay by the due date.
14.       For the reasons given, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim with costs to be taxed

The plaintiffs, United Overseas Bank Limited (the Bank), in applying for the declarations in the amended originating summons, are in effect seeking orders for the rescission of the transactions effected by the parties in August 1985 and a return to the position between them prior to these transactions having been effected on the basis of restitutio in integrum.
Only the first defendants contested the Bank's application. The second, third and fourth defendants did not enter appearance. However, at the time of the hearing, as the second defendants had been wound up and the fourth defendant was already a bankrupt, Miss Yap Siew Yong, appeared for them both to say that they were not contesting these proceedings for lack of funds. She said that the Official Receiver for the second defendants and the Official Assignee for the fourth defendants would be bound by the findings of facts in these proceedings and, on the basis that the plaintiffs prove their claim, orders for declaration would have to be made against the second and fourth defendants. Mr Hamilton QC for the Bank indicated that no relief was sought against the third defendants.
The facts on which the Bank make their claim are to be found in the affidavit of Vivien Chan filed on 9 October 1986. I have somewhat expanded on them as follows.
In August 1980 the Bank granted credit facilities for up to $2m to the first defendants, Malaysia Electric (Geylang) Co Pte Ltd (In Liquidation)(ME). In February 1984, these facilities were increased by a further $1.6m. In total an aggregate of $3.6m in credit facilities was made available to ME. These facilities were secured, inter alia, by:
(a) a first legal mortgage executed by the fourth defendant, Sim Lek Tee (Sim) on 30 August 1980 of his one-half share in Unit B6, People's Park Centre (the Unit); and (b) a second legal mortgage executed by the Sim on 14 February 1984 of his one-half share in the Unit.
Now, I must give some background facts on Sim and his three defendant companies. At the time of the hearing he was 53 years of age and an undischarged bankrupt. At all material times, Sim was a shareholder and director of the three defendant companies. It was said on his behalf by his counsel, Mr Fong, that he was the controlling will and mind of these companies. Indeed, when he gave evidence he said that the first, second and third defendants belonged to him.
In 1963 he started selling electrical goods in a partnership. In October 1979, ME was incorporated to take over the business with a paid-up capital of $2m. There were three shareholders, his wife, Tay Ah Moi, his brother, Sim Tee Tee, and himself. He was the managing director. In 1982 the turnover was about $60m a year; in 1984 the electrical business was bad, the company had difficulties in cash flow; by 1985, the company was unable to pay its debts.
In January 1981, Sim registered the second defendants, People's Park Centre Gold and Jewellers Pte Ltd (PPC) with a paid-up capital of $1m to carry on retail business in gold jewellery. This company had the same three shareholders as ME except that Sim's wife was the managing director and he the chairman. The business was good in 1982 and 1983, but in 1984 and 1985 as the times were bad the company failed to make any profit. In March 1985, Far Eastern Bank Ltd entered a default judgment against PPC for over $1.4m and in August 1985 against Sim as guarantor. PPC was wound up in September 1987 on a petition of Asia Commercial Bank as the company was unable to pay the bank's interests.
Sim formed the third defendants, Sin Cheong Pte Ltd (Sin Cheong) in 1976 with a paid-up capital of $200,002. The shareholders were the same three, his wife, his brother and himself. The company was in the investment business. The only asset the company had was the other one-half share in the Unit.
Reverting back to ME, as I have already said, by early 1985 ME was in financial difficulties. On 29 March 1985 Philips Singapore Pte Ltd (Philips), one of ME's suppliers, sued ME and Sim as guarantor for $535,000 and interest. On 13 April 1985 Philips obtained judgment against ME for the claim and against Sim on 5 of July 1985. On 21 May 1985 Philips presented a winding-up petition against ME which was on 19 June 1985 advertised in the Straits Times, and the Chinese newspaper, Lian He Zao Bao; and it was also advertised on 12 July 1985 in the Government Gazette. On 16 August 1985 an order was made for the compulsory winding up of ME.
Earlier, on 18 June 1985 Philips obtained a Mareva injunction against Sim restraining him from disposing of or dealing with his property. Philips also registered a caveat against Sim's one-half share in the Unit on 7 August 1985 in the Registry of Titles.
In the meantime, sometime in April 1985, the Bank agreed to extend banking facilities to PPC for the purpose of settling ME's loan with the Bank. It was also further agreed that PPC could re-draw on the banking facilities for its trading purposes after PPC had made payment to its account. This loan transaction was finalised by the Letter of Facility dated 23 May 1985, under which the Bank gave PPC credit facilities totalling $3.5m. These facilities were secured, inter alia, by:
(a) a first legal mortgage by Sim of his one- half share in the Unit; and (b) a second legal mortgage by Sin Cheong of the other half-share of the Unit (ranking after the existing first legal mortgage securing Sin Cheong's own account with the Bank). Sim executed the new mortgages in the office of the Bank's solicitors, Shook Lin & Bok.
On or about 14 and 15 August, Shook Lin & Bok, delivered to the Registry of Titles the following documents for provisional registration: (a) Total Discharge of Mortgage in respect of the original mortgages executed by Sim on 30 August 1980 and 14 February 1984 respectively; and (b) the new Mortgages given as securities for the line of credit granted to PPC.
On 21 August 1985 Sim, as the authorised signatory of PPC, drew three cheques totalling $3,534,502.02 on the credit facilities given to PPC in favour of ME. The cheques were handed over to Wong Kim Choong, the Credit Officer with whom Sim dealt with in the Bank and the three sums were credited into ME's account in settlement of ME's outstanding indebtedness.
On 30 of August 1985, Shook Lin & Bok was informed by the Registry of Titles that the documents lodged earlier could not be registered as there was a subsisting caveat by Philips. The solicitors then conducted searches at the Registry of Titles and the Registry of the Supreme Court and discovered, inter alia, the existence of the Mareva injunction against Sim, the order for the winding up of ME, and the caveat of Philips against Sim's one-half share in the Unit.
Pursuant to leave granted by the High Court, on 4 September 1986, the Bank then commenced these proceedings against the four defendants and sought the following declarations: (1) a declaration that the mortgage dated 30 August 1980 and the further mortgage dated 14 February 1984 both made between the Bank (mortgagee) and Sim (mortgagor) and registered as No I/67344B and No I/67828C are valid, subsisting and enforceable against Sim; (2) a declaration that the banking facilities more particularly described in the Bank's letter dated 23 May 1985 were offered and released to the PPC under a fundamental mistake of fact or alternatively pursuant to misrepresentation on the part of Sim and ought to be set aside; (3) a declaration that Sim had wrongfully drawn cheques No 666157, 666158 and 666159 (""the said cheques"") totalling S$3,534,502.02 on behalf of PPC on the Bank in breach of his fiduciary powers as a director of PPC and that the said cheques are null and void accordingly and ought to be cancelled; and (4) a declaration that Sim had wrongfully received the said cheques on behalf of ME, had wrongfully presented the said cheques to the Bank for crediting into the account of the ME with the Bank and that the consequential crediting by the Bank of the sum of S$3,534,502.02 representing the aggregate amount of the said cheques into the account of ME with the Bank was made under a fundamental mistake of fact or alternatively pursuant to misrepresentation on the part of Sim, of no effect and ought to be set aside.
Next, Sim filed an affidavit on 19 November 1986 in response to the affidavit of Vivien Chan. He accepted the material facts in Vivien Chan's affidavit. He said that he always dealt with the Wong Kim Choong (Wong) in the Bank who, according to him, was very familiar with the business carried on and the financial standings of the three defendant companies.
Sim said in his affidavit that in early 1985 he informed the Bank that ME's business was very bad and that ME was in financial difficulties. Because there were several outstanding trade creditors to whom ME owed monies exceeding $3m, ME was unable to pay up the outstanding due to the Bank. Save for Philips, the other major creditors decided not to sue ME and allowed ME to carry on their business in the expectation that things would improve with time.
In March 1985, Philips took court action against ME and Sim. Sim affirmed that it was Wong who had informed him that the Bank knew that Philips had instituted legal proceedings against ME and him. Sim's version of the loan facility by the Bank to PPC was that because of ME's financial difficulties, it was Wong who had ""proposed and devised a new scheme of financial arrangements and I went along with his proposals"". He confirmed the Letter of Facility of 23 May 1985. He maintained that PPC was represented by Shook Lin & Bok and not by their own solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, at the Bank's behest because ""the Bank was anxious to expedite the completion of the legal documents"". As to what happened thereafter between him and the Bank, he said:
""8. On 21 August, 1985 I was asked by Mr Wong to be at the main branch office of the Plaintiffs. I was to bring three (3) blank cheques belonging to the 2nd Defendants' account with the Plaintiffs. At first, Mr Wong asked me to draw the three cheques (exh ""VC4"" in the affidavit of Ms Vivien Chan) in favour of ""UOB"" (the Plaintiffs) as payees but subsequently he instructed me to delete ""UOB"" and write the name of the 1st Defendants instead. I initialled the deletion and wrote the amounts in figures. I also wrote the date in the 3 cheques and signed the three cheques. The amount in words were written and typed by one of the staff of the Plaintiffs. I do not know why I was asked by Mr Wong to make out the three cheques in the three different amounts. I did not question Mr Wong and merely did what I was told to do.""
Much of the matters in the remaining paras of Sim's affidavit refer not to facts, but arguments prepared by his legal advisers; notwithstanding that I would refer to the text in para 11 to show Sim's stand in these proceedings.
""11. I am now convinced that the Plaintiffs have used the Defendants to suit their own ends. They knew that the 1st Defendants would collapse. The banking facilities of S$3,534,502.02 granted to the 1st Defendants were secured mainly by the first and second legal mortgages of my undivided one half share of Unit B6, ... The Plaintiffs had no other security of value to cover their exposure to the imminent loss of S$3,534,502.02. In contrast thereto the banking facilities granted to the 2nd Defendants, a profitable going concern then, were far better secured by the several valuable securities emunerated in pages 4 and 5 of the Plaintiffs' letter of 23 May 1985 ... The Plaintiffs also felt that the 2nd Defendants were better placed to meet the interest payments on the facility. It is therefore hardly surprising that the Plaintiffs were in a great rush and hurry when they instructed their solicitors, Ms Shook Lin & Bok that ""This matter is urgent and we are working towards having the documents signed within 2 weeks"" ... ""
The third and only other affidavit in these proceedings was filed by Wong for the Bank. It was a response to Sim's affidavit. Wong said that whilst he was familiar with ME's and PPC's accounts with the Bank, he did not know of the actual financial standing of ME and PPC as up-to-date financial statements of these two companies were not made available to the Bank. He knew that ME were facing cash flow problems but not the extent of their total indebtedness. Sim had informed him that ME's collection of trade debts in the electrical business was slow and that he was going to concentrate on his gold and jewellery business. That was why Sim wanted the Bank to grant facilities to PPC and the Bank had agreed to transfer the line of credit from ME to PPC. He said that market feedback had been that suppliers to ME might be pressing ahead with legal proceedings but he had no knowledge of Philips' action against ME or Sim. He did not inform Sim that the Bank knew of Philips' action.
Wong did ask Sim to be at the Bank's main office to settle ME's account. The amounts in the three cheques were the outstanding sums owing by ME. He wanted the name of the Bank on the cheques deleted and ME's name substituted because the payee's name should be ME as the cheques were to be credited to the three outstanding accounts of ME. He did not know at that time of any winding-up proceedings against ME or that ME and Sim were insolvent. He had no knowledge that ME would collapse.
The Bank did not have an exposure to the imminent loss of $3,534,502.02 as they had, in addition to the mortgages, guarantees and shares as securities for the outstanding. The urgency indicated by the Bank to their solicitors was due to the fact that Sim required the line of credit to be transferred to PPC as soon as possible. On legal representation, Wong said that the Bank was informed by Sim that his solicitors were Ng Wong & Chung. However, when Shook Lin & Bok wrote to them, the reply was that they did not receive any instructions to act for PPC. Wong said that if the Bank had known that ME was insolvent, they would not have agreed to Sim's request.
The three deponents of the affidavits gave oral evidence at the hearing. The first was Vivien Chan. She has been with the Bank since 1981 and was at the time of hearing the Head of the Legal Department and the Secretary of the Bank. She did not have any direct dealings with any of the defendant companies. She met Sim only once, either in July or August 1985, soon after the Bank was informed that the new mortgages could not be registered.
She did not know of the proceedings by Philips against ME and Sim. She became aware of them only after Shook Lin & Bok had made the searches and informed her about them. She was horrified when she learnt from Shook Lin & Bok about the affairs of ME. She said if she had known earlier she would not have allowed the loan transactions which created the new mortgages to go through.
She also did not know that Far Eastern Bank had obtained a default judgment against PPC in March 1985 and against Sim as guarantor in August 1985 for over $1.4m. She knew of them only the week before the hearing when she was shown the bundle of cause papers.
When shown the Statement of Affairs of ME (P1), she said that the Bank has not submitted a proof of debt for their claim; nor has the Official Receiver requested the Bank to submit a proof. The figure of just over $2.8m in Schedule G, the List of Unsecured Creditors in P1, was not a correct figure. She had no idea of how this figure came to be put there. She was also shown the Statement of Affairs of PPC (P2). The Bank has also not submitted a proof of debt. She was not aware of how the figure of $15,868.09 in this Schedule G was arrived at. The amount outstanding from PPC to the Bank was a much larger amount. She was also shown the Statement of Affairs (P3) of Sim in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said the Bank had not lent Sim personally any money which was outstanding whereas List C shows the Bank as creditor in the sum of $2m.
In cross-examination, she said that the facts contained in her affidavit and of which she gave evidence were all information and instructions that were given to her by the Credit Department of the Bank, in particular she got them from Wong. To a question from Mr Fong, she said that it was not for her to satisfy herself that PPC have the powers to borrow. She left that to the Bank's solicitors. It was not strange to her that PPC would borrow to settle the debt of ME. She was taken through the Letter of Facility dated 23 of May 1985. She explained how the loan given to PPC would be used by them to discharge the liability of ME to the Bank. Nothing turns on these matters.
On another topic, she said that it was part of her duties to obtain information for the Bank about legal proceedings brought against customers of the Bank. She was unaware of the Cause Book in the Registry of the Supreme Court or of another cause book in the subordinate courts. But she knew of organisations that supply information on civil proceedings initiated in Singapore commonly known as credit information organisations. She believed these organisations supply weekly or bi-weekly lists to their customers. The Bank is now customer of such an organisation, but she did not know whether in 1985 the Bank was. Yet, on another topic she said that the Bank did not tell Shook Lin & Bok to act for Sim and PPC. In fact, she had told the solicitors that it was Ng Wong & Chung who were solicitors for Sim and PPC.
The next witness, Wong, confirmed the contents of his affidavit. He said that in the Credit Department one does get market feedback from colleagues on matters regarding the Bank's customers. He denied that he informed Sim that the Bank knew of Philips' actions. He said that if he had known of the steps taken by Philips in the courts, he would have reported them to his superiors and taken legal advice from the Legal Department. He only became aware after his Legal Department told him that the mortgages could not be completed.
He said that Sim had told him that the electrical business was slow and collections were poor, and that his gold business was doing well. Therefore, Sim wanted the facilities ME had with the Bank to be transferred to PPC and ME's accounts with the Bank were to be paid up. This was to be effected by implementing the $3.5m credit line to PPC. PPC then drew three cheques totalling about $3.5m to ME's account to pay off its debts. Wong was of the view that the payee's name on the three cheques should be ME since ME was to pay off its debts owing to the Bank. He said that the amounts in the three cheques exactly paid off all the outstanding accounts of ME with the Bank.
Wong did not think that Sim was a stupid man. He was an experienced businessman. He was asked to come to the Bank to clear ME's debts. He knew that the three amounts in the three cheques were for the three different types of facilities enjoyed by ME. Sim also knew that the monies drawn on the three cheques were to be used only to pay off the debts of ME. They were not to become the general monies of ME.
Wong confirmed that he did inform the Legal Department that Ng Wong & Chung would act for Sim and PPC in the legal mortgage. He couldn't recall but believed Sim told him of this. As far as he could recall, it was Sim who wanted to complete as soon as possible. He did not ask why.
In cross-examination, Wong was asked about his experience as a credit officer in 1985 (he had joined the Bank in 1983), and the steps he had taken to recommend to the Bank to give the loan to PPC. He was questioned at length on the Credit Report he had made at that time. He was satisfied that there was sufficient security for the loan.
At that time he did not know that ME was trading in physical gold or that PPC was trading in the gold market. He knew, however, that Sim was utilising the gold facility referred to as the BPG line which ME and PPC had with the Bank but he did not know the purpose. He presumed it was in the course of their business. He was not concerned.
Considerable time and effort was spent on the topic whether the loan ME had was a problem loan. Wong maintained that ME's account with the Bank was not a problem account. It was not a ""classified"" account, that is to say, it did not fall under one of the four categories set out by MAS. He, however, readily agreed with Mr Fong that if it meant that in 1985 overdue bills of ME were not repaid it was in that sense a problem account. Wong was shown the Statement of Account of the Overdraft Facility (D2) of ME with the Bank. At the material time, in these accounts there were lots of small credits and debits. He did not consider this to be a problem account but he did call Sim to cover this overdraft. Even as regards the gold credit line on which there were overdue bills, he used to press Sim to pay up. That was why Sim came to the Bank in April 1985 for a transfer of the loan from ME to PPC. The Bank had agreed because it expected Sim's companies to turn around. Besides calling up Sim, Wong brought ME's accounts to the notice of his bosses. In any event, as Mr Fong reminded him, Wong agreed 1985 was a bad year, a lot of companies were facing difficulties. His bosses, too, asked him to call Sim to pay up.
Finally, it was put to Wong that the whole transaction was designed by Wong and others in the Bank to recover as much as they could from a bad facility. He denied it. He reiterated that it was Sim who made the request for the transfer. On the facility letter dated 23 of May 1985, it was put to him that the true purpose was not stated in the letter because the Bank wanted to conceal that fact. He said that it was not true.
The last witness was Sim. He was now a salesman in a jewellery shop. In cross-examination, it was obtained from him that he was working for People's Park Jewellers Pte Ltd which was carrying on business in that part of the Unit where PPC had carried on a similar business. His two daughters were the directors of this company. He claimed that he had no say in the running of this business.
Of his personal assets in 1985, he had (a) a property in Nassim Road which he bought as vacant land in 1980/81 for $1.1m and had a bungalow built on it for which he spent more that $1m; (b) a building known as Lai Lai Complex at No 42 East Coast Road of which he was half owner, a shopping complex of about 20,000 square feet valued then at $10m, financed by Malayan Banking to the tune of $7m; (c) a bungalow house at No 1 King's Walk, his residence, then valued at $1.8m pledged to Asia Commercial Bank for $1.2m; (d) the Unit, B6 in People's Park Complex; and (e) shares in companies.
He confirmed that he only dealt with Wong in the Bank. As he put it, there was no need to inform others in the Bank. He confirmed para 5 of his affidavit that in April 1985 when he went to the Bank Wong told him that Philips had taken action against him, Mr Fong asked him:
"" Q. Why did he tell you this? How did it come about? A. He must tell me. He was the officer taking charge of the account. Q. Why did you go to the Bank on that occasion? A. I used to go to the Bank, once or twice a week to bank in money. ""
On the minute of a Board meeting of PPC dated 22 July 1985 signed by him approving the arrangements for the $3.5m credit facilities given by the Bank to PPC, Sim confirmed that the resolution had his signature. He said that he was the only person present in the making of the resolution. Then Sim made the astonishing allegation that the resolution was prepared by the Bank and that Wong handed it to him. Needless to say, Wong was not questioned on it nor was it put to him. When Sim was cross-examined on it, he said that he did consult his wife and younger brother, the other directors of PPC on this board resolution.
In cross-examination, Sim was questioned on the contents of three documents which Mr Hamilton had put in when he opened the case for the Bank. They were (a) the Statement of Affairs of ME (P1), affirmed to by Sim's brother, Sim Tee Tee; (b) the Statement of Affairs of PPC (P2), affirmed to by Sim's daughter, Sim Chay Hiang; and (c) Sim's own Statement of Affairs (P3) affirmed by him after the receiving order and adjudication order were made against him.
On P1 he said he did discuss it with Sim Tee Tee and that the Statement was correct. But when he was taken through P1, he admitted, as he put it, that there were ""mistakes"". Some instances would suffice: I take Schedule B, the List of Sundry Debtors in P1: (i) PPC, formerly known as Chevelina Pte Ltd, shown as ""company closed down"" was wrong; (ii) Sin Cheong, described as ""company is insolvent"" was also wrong; (iii) Sim shown as a debtor to ME in the sum of $14.8m, out of the total debt of ME of $18.8m was simply not true; (iv) SLT Pte Ltd, a property investment company, the shareholders of which were Sim, his wife and brothers, shown as a debtor to ME for over $1m and described as ""insolvent"" were also false.
Sim was then referred to Schedule G, the List of Unsecured Creditors in P1 and asked to explain how the Bank was shown as a creditor for $2.8m when after 21 of August 1985, ME drew no further monies from the Bank. He said that it arose from the current account, but there was no such account. He was also asked to explain why PPC were not shown as creditors of ME. He did not give a direct answer but kept saying that PPC were not creditors of ME.
He was then referred to the Statement of Affairs of PPC, P2. In Schedule B the only sundry debtor of PPC was himself for over $3.7m. He said that PPC's only asset was the debt owed by him. He was then shown his own Statement of Affairs, P3, which he had affirmed.
"" Q. You have for the last half an hour said that you were a debtor to first defendants for $14.8m and to the second defendants for $3.7m. Why are those two companies not shown as creditors in your personal bankruptcy? A. I was thinking that the amount of money that I owe to these two companies was as a result of what I made use of my things to mortgage. Court: Q. (Question reput.) A. Because I did not know I have to state that amounts I owed to my own companies. Q. Once those companies had gone into liquidation, you knew perfectly well that you must repay to those companies the monies you had taken for the benefit of the creditors of those companies? A. Yes. I knew that the monies I took had to be paid back. Q. Yet you did not choose to show them in your statement of affairs? A. It is my mistake. ""
In the course of his cross-examination, Sim admitted that in April 1985 he did discuss with Wong on his accounts with the Bank. He did tell Wong at a meeting that his electrical business was not doing well and that he wanted to concentrate on his gold business. On the topic of legal representation, he did tell the Bank that his solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, would act for PPC for the new facilities. Later, it was he, and not the Bank, who asked Shook Lin & Bok to act for him. He said more than once that no one from the Bank asked him to go to Shook Lin & Bok. He went there on his own accord. He was pointedly asked whether the Bank had put any pressure on him to hurry things up. He said: ""No.""
When he went to Shook Lin & Bok he did not tell the solicitors about the winding-up proceedings against ME or of Philips' injunction against him. When it was put to him that he did not tell the solicitors because he knew that if he had told them, they would not allow him to go ahead with the transactions, he avoided the question by saying he knew nothing about the law. After he was pressed on the matter, he denied and said that that was not in his mind. When it was further put to him that the reason why he did not go to his own solicitors, Ng Wong & Chung, was because they too would not have allowed the transactions to go through, Sim was driven into a corner. He said: ""It was not I who did not want to go to Ng Wong & Chung; it was they < the Bank > who told me to go to Shook Lin & Bok.""
Finally, Sim was taken through paras 8, 9 and 11 of his affidavit. On para 8 quoted above, he now confessed that he knew exactly what he was doing when he signed the three cheques. He agreed that the purpose was to enable ME to pay off its indebtedness to the Bank; this would release his first mortgage on the Unit; that would allow a new mortgage on it to be executed so that PPC could have the use of the new facilities. He also agreed that ME could not have used these monies for any other purpose.
On para nine of his affidavit that the Bank knew and/or ought to have known that ME were subject to winding up proceedings, he admitted that he had not specifically told Wong of it. He now denied his statement in this para that at all material times the Bank knew that ME and he were insolvent. He agreed that he had only told Wong he was having financial difficulties, and had hoped to recover from them.
Still on para nine, he said he had had dealings with Wong over a period of time and had found him to be a truthful person. On the last sentence in this para that the Bank knew that legal proceedings have been commenced by Philips against ME and him, he said he did not tell Wong of this.
On para 11 of his affidavit quoted above, Sim said that he had only privately thought that the Bank ought to have known that ME would collapse but he did not tell Wong of it. He confirmed that the Bank had on top of the mortgages, other securities and guarantees. He confirmed that the Bank would not suffer a loss of $3.5m. He did not tell the Bank that there would be an ""imminent"" loss. Through a line of questions, Sim admitted that the statement in para 11 that PPC was a profitable going concern in the middle of 1985 was not true because in March 1985 Far Eastern Bank had obtained judgment for over $1.4m and by August 1985 PPC was insolvent.
After Sim had given evidence, ME closed its case. Mr Hamilton then made a full submission on the whole of the evidence. He concluded that the two witnesses for the Bank, Vivien Chan and Wong were good and honest witnesses, they were indeed truthful witnesses. On the other hand, the same could not be said of the witness for ME. Sim was not only a very evasive witness, he had also contradicted his affidavit evidence and his evidence-in-chief in very material matters. On the three Statements of Affairs, P1, P2, and P3, Sim and his co-directors had clearly affirmed to facts and figures which were patently false. Most important of all was that Sim finally confirmed the evidence given by Vivien Chan and Wong for the Bank.
For ME, Mr Fong tendered a written submission of 46 pages. In it there is a recital of the chronology of events, and some criticisms of Wong's evidence and even of Vivien Chan's evidence, but there is no analysis whatsoever of Sim's evidence. For myself, there was no doubt in my mind that Sim's evidence was crucial, for if his evidence of the events relating to the transactions was rejected, then on the other evidence before me the Bank must succeed on the grounds of misrepresentation and/or fundamental mistake of fact. So, I come to the findings of fact I made in this case.
It is in order to make clear the findings that I have in this judgment dealt extensively with the evidence given at the hearing. I must now say that I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Vivien Chan and Wong for the Bank on how the new facilities came to be given to PPC and of their knowledge of the affairs of ME, PPC and of Sim's business interests at the material time. On Sim's evidence I would observe that for one who had been a successful businessman he cut a poor figure in court. I would like to think that he had only himself to blame for the predicament he was in. At the end of his stay in the witness box he redeemed himself somewhat by accepting the Bank's version of the transactions. Let me summarise the essential findings of facts. (1) Neither Wong nor the Bank knew or were made aware of any of Philips' legal actions against ME and Sim. (2) Neither Wong nor the Bank had ""devised"" the new facilities for PPC; the proposal came from Sim and the Bank agreed to it.
(3) The purpose of the loan to PPC was to enable ME to clear its indebtedness to the Bank. (4) The argument of Mr Fong that because the facility letter of 23 May 1985 did not mention the above reason for the loan, the loan transaction was flawed cannot be sustained, for it was not supported by evidence. ME did not call any evidence that a letter of facility must state the reason for the loan. To my knowledge, such is not the case. (5) Sim went to Shook Lin & Bok on his own accord because Ng Wong and Chung would have declined to act for him for the new mortgages.
It was clear to me that this case had to be resolved on the facts. To use the words of Lawton LJ in Rolled Steel Products (Holdings) Ltd v British Steel Corporation and Others (1986) 1 Ch 246 at 307 (a case brought to my attention by Mr Fong in his written submission):
"" Stripped of its legal complications, many of which were caused by the way the trial judge dealt with the defendants' applications to amend the pleadings, this case raises issues of fact. When the evidence is looked at in the round, there is revealed an unattractive story of a fairly common kind which shows how some business men manipulate limited liability companies to avoid their financial liabilities and what other business men are driven to do in order to get paid what they are entitled to receive. ""
In the present case, whether there was misrepresentation and/or a fundamental mistake of fact were questions of fact. On these, I accepted the written submissions for the Bank.
The relevant facts on misrepresentation are these. Sim and PPC knew at the material times that ME was subject to winding up proceedings and Sim knew he was subject to the Mareva injunction. In purporting to discharge ME's indebtedness to the Bank, Sim had represented to the Bank that ME was still trading, was not in liquidation and could make a valid payment to the Bank to discharge its indebtedness. In executing the new mortgage Sim further represented to the Bank that there was no restriction on his dealing with his property. The Bank, on the other hand, was unaware of these facts. The Bank induced by these representations allowed PPC to draw on the new facilities given to them for the purpose of providing funds to ME to pay off ME's indebtedness to the Bank. In my view, these facts clearly engendered misrepresentations which entitled the Bank to rescind the transactions.
On the subject of fundamental mistake of fact, the Bank made a mistake that ME as a trading company not subject to winding up proceedings, let alone a winding up order, was in a position to pay off their indebtedness to the Bank. Another mistake was that the Bank acted on the assumption that Sim was able to grant to the Bank a new first legal mortgage on his one-half share in the Unit, which in fact was not the case as there was the caveat registered at the Registry of Titles by Philips. Moreover, Sim was in breach of the Mareva injunction. The Bank knew of none of these matters. The Bank would not have made the payments but for their mistaken assumptions. Because the Bank had, under the mistaken assumptions, allowed PPC to draw on their facilities, they were, in my view, entitled to rescind the transactions and the various payments made and the documents executed must be set aside.
It is helpful here that I refer to Solle v Butcher (1950) 1 KB 671 (another case from Mr Fong's written submission). In arriving at my decision I was guided by what Denning LJ (as he then was) said on the subject of mistakes and misrepresentations arising in contracts. In particular at page 692, he said:
"" Let me next consider mistakes which render a contract voidable, that is, liable to be set aside on some equitable ground. Whilst presupposing that a contract was good at law, or at any rate not void, the court of equity would often relieve a party from the consequences of his own mistake, so long as it could do so without injustice to third parties. The court, it was said had power to set aside the contract whenever it was of opinion that it was unconscientious for the other party to avail himself of the legal advantage which he had obtained: Torrance v Bolten (1876-8) 1 QBD 348 per James LJ.
The court had, of course, to define what it considered to be unconscientious, but in this respect equity has shown a progressive development. It is now clear that a contract will be set aside if the mistake of the one party has been induced by a material misrepresentation of the other, even though it was not fraudulent or fundamental; or if one party, knowing that the other is mistaken about the terms of an offer, or the identity of the person by whom it is made, lets him remain under his delusion and concludes a contract on the mistaken terms instead of pointing out the mistake.""
At the end of the day, the question I had to ask was: if the Bank had known the true facts, would the Bank have paid the money? The answer was surely ""No"". Accordingly, I made an order in term of paras one, two and four of the amended originating summons.",1992-06-26 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The plaintiffs' claim is for $192,962.08 plus interest at 1/24% per day against the defendants as guarantors under a guarantee and indemnity dated 6 January 1982 (`the Guarantee'). By the Guarantee the defendants `jointly and severally guarantee on demand by you the punctual payment by the Company of all sums due under the said Financing Agreement and the due performance of the Company's obligations thereunder and we further jointly and severally undertake to indemnify you against all losses, expenses (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis) charges and damages incurred or suffered by you in consequence of any failure by the Company to perform any of the Company's obligations under the said Financing Agreement'. The financing was on accounts receivable.
The Company was Futraco Pte Ltd (`Futraco'). Of the 400,000 issued shares of Futraco, the first defendant held 200,000; his son Tan Teow Siang, the third defendant, held 100,000 and the remaining 100,000 were held by the fifth defendant. The second defendant, Tan Teow Kee, another son of the first defendant, was the managing director. The first and third defendants were also directors.
These proceedings were commenced on 20 July 1985.
On 10 January 1986 summary judgment for $192,962.08 plus interest under Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court was entered against the fourth defendant.
On 20 January 1986 summary judgment for a similar amount under Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court was entered against the fifth defendant.
Receiving and Adjudication orders have been made against both the fourth and fifth defendants. Futraco has also been wound up.
The second defendant has not been served. Hence the proceedings continued against only the first and third defendants.
At the hearing, the first and third defendants (`both defendants') disputed the claim on both liability and quantum. By consent hearing proceeded only on the issue of liability leaving quantum to be disposed of at a later date. On liability it is not disputed by both defendants that they executed the Guarantee. But they deny liability on the following grounds: (1) that by a letter dated 28 December 1982 (`D-2') they gave notice to terminate their Guarantee to take effect six months from 22 December 1982;
(2) alternatively that there was an oral collateral agreement or warranty that the facilities to be given to Futraco should not exceed $300,000. However in March 1983 this amount was raised to $350,000 without their consent. This constituted a substantial material variation which thereby discharged them from liability under the Guarantee; (3) in the further alternative, both defendants contended that the plaintiffs continued financing Futraco even after the plaintiffs knew that Futraco was selling goods on `consignment basis' thereby breaching cl 4(m) of the Financing Agreement stipulating that the amount of receivables should at all time be at least 143% of the amount due to the plaintiffs from Futraco.
I now deal with the three grounds raised by the defence. On ground (1), it is the plaintiffs' case that they never received any notice from the first, second and third defendants terminating the Guarantee. According to both defendants, D-2, after being signed by the first, second and third defendants on 28 December 1982, was sent by ordinary post by the third
defendant to the plaintiffs. D-2 read: ""Messrs Tan Kia Poh Tan Teow Kee Tan Teow Siang c/o 17-19 Jalan Kilang Barat Singapore 0315

Dear Sirs,
Re: FUTRACO PTE LTD
We are writing to inform you that we have resigned as director of the above company with effect from 22nd December 1982.
Please note that we have in principle agreed to guarantee the existing accounts receivables finance facilities for a duration of six months commencing from 22nd December 1982 until the outstanding amount are paid. After we will like to withdraw as guarantors for any credit facilities that you are granting to the company.
We thank you for your attention.
Yours faithfully,

There was no acknowledgement from the plaintiffs of the receipt of D-2. Neither was there any confirma- tion from the plaintiffs that the first to the third defendants would be discharged from their liability under the Guarantee in accordance with D-2. Yet they took no steps to obtain such confirmation. They also took no steps to ensure that Futraco would be discharging its liability to the plaintiffs incurred before the purported termination of their Guarantee. On 10 April 1985 the plaintiffs demanded of Futraco by letter as follows: ""Our Ref: AR/HSY/HFL/cl

Re: Settlement of loan by instalments - Accounts Receivable Finance
We refer to the last meeting held between yourselves and our Mr David Chan, Freddie Lee and Miss Hoong on 5th March 1985 where you agreed to settle the outstanding Accounts Receivable loan by 3 monthly instalments of at least $78,000 per month, commencing March 1985.
At the end of March, our Freddie called to propose that we should notify your debtors in order to assist with your collections when no payments were received from your major debtors.
However we have withheld notification upon your request as you mentioned that you were expecting some payments from Hong Sheng and Emporium Holdings in early April. To date, there were no payments from these debtors and the first of the instalments as proposed was not kept up with.
Under these circumstances, we will notify your debtors without further reference to you unless you immediately update the previously agreed upon instalments (of $117,000/- for month of March and part of April) which must reach us by 15th April latest.
The foregoing does not preclude us from taking further legal action as deemed appropriate by us to cover the outstanding sums due together with interests and costs.

Although this letter of demand was copied to the first to third defendants as `guarantors' their only reaction was a request by letter dated 23 April 1985 through their solicitors for a copy of the Guarantee. There was no allegation by them that they had terminated their Guarantee even when a direct demand
was made on them under the Guarantee by letter of 5 July 1985 for the sum of $192,962.08 and interest thereon. Even in his affidavit of 19 November 1985 the third defendant only contended that they had been discharged as guarantors not by D-2 but by events taking place after their resignation as directors, that is, the increase in the facility by $50,000 to $350,000 and financing on invoices for goods sold on `returnable' basis. This contention presupposed that their Guarantee had not been terminated or revoked earlier.
In the Order 14 proceedings before the registrar no reference or claim was made on both defendants' behalf of their having terminated or revoked the Guarantee.
In their defence filed on 15 April 1986 again nowhere was it alleged that they had revoked or terminated their Guarantee and D-2 was never referred to. It was only in paras 5 and 6 of their proposed amended defence annexed to the Notice of Further Direction of 4th June 1991 that revocation and termination of their Guarantee was raised and
reference made to D-2 for the first time. I find the evidence of DW3 (third defendant) on how D-2 was located hard to accept. (Page 59 of notes of evidence). Both defendants were allegedly advised in mid-1985 by their solicitors to look for, inter alia, D-2. They allegedly found these letters (being D-2 and two other letters D-1 and D-3 relating to their resignation from the Board of and the sale of their shares in Futraco) after more than one year later in June 1986 and immediately handed them to their solicitors. At first DW3 said these documents were found in a `Fuji Silk' company file. Later he said it was found in a `Fu Yuan, Nan Seng and Miscellaneous' file. It was not in a `Futraco' file, and it was found after DW3 had opened all 50-60 carton boxes except for 3 or 4 of the boxes (pages 64-66 of notes of evidence). Each box is said to contain 50 files, if the files were thick then about 10 files. If D-2 was in fact handed over to their solicitors in June 1986, there is no reason why reference was only made to it for the first time in their draft amended defence on 4 June 1991. I therefore reject both defendants' allegation that they had sent D-2 to the plaintiffs in December 1982.
On ground (2) being the defence that there was an oral collateral agreement or warranty that the facilities to Futraco should not exceed $300,000, both defendants, through their family shareholding and their membership of the Board were in control of Futraco. It is therefore unlikely that they would have gone to plaintiffs for financing facilities and at the same time stipulated that such facilities should not exceed $300,000.
There was also no limit specified in the Financing Agreement. Clause 2 of the Financing Agreement provided that plaintiffs would grant to Futraco financial facilities to `such extent and for so long as the Company in its absolute discretion thinks fit. ... ...'
According to PW1, one Hoong Fong Ling, the senior accounts manager of the plaintiffs, the initial financing was to a limit of $300,000 and 60% of the goods sold. See page 6 of the notes of evidence:
""... ... At this meeting with the four defendants no one said advances should be no more than $300,000. No one said we should
not advance more than a certain percentage of the invoices. There was no discussion on a limit on the Guarantee. If they did we would have asked for a limited guarantee. We explained to Tan Kia Poh that the initial financing would be up to $300,000. We said this could be subject to change. We informed all the four defendants on the formula of 60% on the advances.
Q: It is alleged by 1st and 3rd defendants that either you or Freddie Lee had orally agreed and warranted to them with the intention that this representation be relied on that plaintiffs would in no event lend Futraco sums in excess of $300,000. Do you agree?
A: No.
Q: It is also alleged that you represented that plaintiffs would advance only 60% of the value of goods sold and no more. Is it true?
A: No. We are at liberty to vary it at any time.""
PW1 is corroborated by PW2, one Freddie Lee Cheng Seng who was the former assistant manager of the plaintiffs' Trade Finance Division. At the date of the hearing, he was no longer with the plaintiffs. See his evidence at page 36 of the notes of evidence:
""Q: Did 1st defendant say he wished that the facility should be no more than $300,000?
A: No. That meeting at which these documents were handed over to defendants was my first meeting with them.
Q: At that meeting did 1st defendant make any request that you should not advance in excess of 60% or 70% of the book debts?
A: No. Normally the client wants as high a percentage as possible. But we want to limit our exposure. In this instance we fixed our limit at $300,000.
Q: You told 1st defendant that was the limit?
A: It could have been interpreted as the credit limit.
Q: So you informed Futraco of the limit of the facility, did you also tell 1st defendant this could be varied depending on future performance?
A: Yes.""
I accept the evidence of PW1 and PW2.
A Form 34 dated 6 January 1982 was filed stating the amount of the charge in favour of the plaintiffs on Futraco's accounts receivable at $300,000. This is not inconsistent with the evidence of PW1 and PW2. Later when the limit was raised by $50,000 to $350,000 another Form 34 dated 17 March 1983 was filed stating:
""The additional amount secured by the charge is:- Dollars Fifty Thousand only ($50,000) thereby
making the total facilities the sum of Dollars Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand only ($350,000).""
The percentage of 60% fluctuated upwards to 70% in 1983 and back to 60% around November 1984. But the increase of $50,000 in the limit of the facility was certainly within the scope of cl 2 of the Financing Agreement.
By the terms of the Guarantee the defendants guaranteed the payment by Futraco of all sums due under the Financing Agreement and also undertook to indemnify the plaintiffs against all losses arising as a result of Futraco's failure to pay.
On the evidence adduced I reject both defendants' allegation that there was a collateral agreement or warranty to the defendants that the limit would be $300,000 and no more. If that was so, a limited guarantee would have been entered into.
On ground (3) being the further alternative defence that the plaintiffs gave finance in excess of the limit of 70% of the accounts receivable when they
knowingly gave advance on invoices on sales on consignment basis and not bona fide sales is inherently incredible. To do so on the part of the plaintiffs would be to perpetrate a fraud on themselves. The evidence also shows that the plaintiffs stopped further financing by early January 1985 after it was discovered that goods had been sold on `returnable' basis. See the evidence of PW1 at page 22 of the notes of evidence:
""A: ... ... We were aware that in the garment trade returns are quite normal. If the returns were not high we would not mind. I became aware of the high rate of return in mid-1984. I checked with the 5th defendant. Also around mid- 1984. He explained that he allowed the goods returned to be exchanged for goods of fresh design. When I received audit report of November 1984 (D-6) this was the first time that the possibility of consignment sales was raised by the auditors. I spoke to 5th defendant. He mentioned the same stand that there were exchanges for new design goods and not consignment sales. At that time the financing margin was 70%. I had to reduce it to 60% because of the high returns. It was 60% at the beginning, went up to 70% in 1983 and I brought it back to 60% around November 1984. Around December 1984 or early January 1985 we asked our auditors to go down to the Futraco's premises to do a detailed audit to confirm this suspicion. Their report of 18.1.85 confirmed our suspicion. We had stopped further advances from January 1985. ...""
Accordingly I held both defendants liable to the plaintiffs under the Guarantee with costs reserved pending the further hearing on quantum.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
The plaintiff is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore practising at the material time and presently under the name and style of Ronnie Chong & Co.
The defendant is also an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore but has ceased practising as an advocate and solicitor and is now an Insurance Adviser residing at No 1 Anembo Court, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia.
Pursuant to a partnership agreement subsequently reduced to writing dated 27 July 1988 ('the partner- ship agreement') the defendant was admitted as an equal partner of the plaintiff in the firm of Ronnie Chong & Company with effect from 22 February 1988.
By clause 3 of the partnership agreement the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $9,500 as 'premium' on joining the partnership.
By clause 2 of the partnership agreement certain existing office equipment belonging to the plaintiff were valued and sold to the partnership at $4,900. By clause 4 thereof, the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff $2,450 being his 50% contribution therefor.
Therefore the total amount payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on the defendant's admission to partnership was $11,950. The defendant paid the sum of $7,000. The balance of $4,950 by clause 5(ii) was to be paid on 15 June 1989.
From 23 April 1988 the name of the partnership became 'Ronny Chong & Arul'.
Under clause 6 of the partnership agreement all losses including loss of capital were to be borne by the plaintiff and defendant equally.
Pursuant to the partnership agreement the plaintiff and defendant as partners entered into a Lease dated 15 April 1988 for three years commencing 1 April 1988 with Singapore Airlines Ltd in respect of a portion of the 14th storey of the building known as SIA Building, Robinson Road, Singapore measuring 1190 sq ft at the monthly rental of $2.50 per sq ft.
For the purpose of the partnership the plaintiff and defendant entered into the following:
(i) a hire purchase agreement with Showa Leasing (Singapore) Pte Ltd whereby certain fittings and installations were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for $35,319.00 plus term charges of $3,033.00. After a down payment of $9,000 the balance of $29,352.00 was to be paid by 24 monthly instalments of $1,223.00 per month commencing on 19 May 1988;
(ii) an agreement with the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd and as guarantors relating thereto for overdraft facilities to the firm of Ronny Chong and Arul to a limit of $20,000; (iii) A Hire Purchase Agreement dated 18 May 1988 with Sing Investments & Finance Ltd whereby a 'Friday PC' word processor with Logitec 31 CPS Daisy Wheel Printer were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for $5,271.05 by 35 instalments of $134.00 per month and a final instalment of $111.05 commencing 18 May 1988; (iv) A Hire Purchase Agreement dated 13 May 1988 with Sing Investments & Finance Ltd whereby certain office furniture were let on hire with option to purchase to the partnership for a sum of $8,835.55 to be paid by 35 monthly instalments of $224.00 and a final instalment of $207.15 commencing 13 May 1988.
The partnership was dissolved with effect from 19 October 1988. The plaintiff and defendant then jointly instructed a certified public accountant one Subramaniam Sankaran to draw up the profit and loss account and balance sheet of their partnership up to the date of dissolution.
From 19 October 1988 each carried on his own practice with both agreeing to employ all the existing staff and using facilities of the former partnership until 30 November 1988 and paying therefor equally.
On 19 January 1989 the defendant removed his belongings from the office premises without surrendering the keys thereto to the plaintiff. It transpired that he emigrated to Australia thereafter.
As the Lease, overdraft facilities and the various Hire Purchase Agreements were entered into by the plaintiff and defendant as partners, the plaintiff remained jointly liable and he therefore had to and made payment thereunder.
Consequently the plaintiff claimed the sum of $79,677.49 made up of the following items: (i) $4,950 being balance of the amount payable on admission into the partnership by the defendant; (ii) $25,152.31 being amount found due according to the accounts of the partnership drawn up to the date of dissolution of the partner- ship by the said Subramaniam Sankaran; (iii) the sum of $3,462.68 being 50% contribution for the expenses of the firm from 19 October 1988 to 30 November 1988 when the plaintiff and defendant carried on their respective individual practice sharing expenses equally; (iv) the sum of $11,900 being 50% contribution for the rent of the office premises from 16 November 1988 to 15 June 1989; (v) the sum of $34,212.50 being 50% contribution for the office rent from 16 June 1989 to 15 May 1991. The total amount claimed for items (i) to (v) is $79,677.49.
On 25 January 1990 the plaintiff applied by Summons in Chambers Entered No 450/90 for final judgment in the sum of $55,877.49. On 24 July 1991 the assistant registrar entered judgment for the plaintiff for $42,002.31 arrived at as follows: (i) $4,950.00 being item (i) above; (ii) $25,152.31 being item (ii) above; and (iii) $11,900.00 being item (iv) above. The balance of the plaintiff's claim is to go for trial.
The defendant appealed. The appeal came before me. I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
Item (i) for $4,950.00 By clause 2 of the partnership agreement, 4 items of existing office equipment belonging to the plaintiff were valued at and sold to the partnership for $4,900.00. By clause 4 of the partnership agreement, the defendant agreed to pay half the value thereof at $2,450.00. By clause 3 of the partnership agreement the defendant agreed to pay by way of 'premium' the sum of $9,500.00 making a total of $11,950.00. The defendant paid $7,000.00 leaving a balance of $4,950.00. By clause 5 of the partnership agreement, payment of the balance of $4,950.00 was deferred to 15 June 1989. The defendant is therefore clearly liable for this item. Item (ii) for $25,152.31 This is the amount found due from the defendant to the plaintiff on the profit and loss account and balance sheet of the partnership prepared by the said Subramaniam Sankaran up to the date of dissolution of the partnership on 19 October 1988. In para 10 of his defence the defendant made bare allegation of error in the accounts and under valuation of the assets in the accounts. By para 11 of the defence, the defendant also contended that the accounts prepared by the said Subramaniam Sankaran, were not binding on him as he had not signed the same. The defendant relied on clause 9 of the partnership agreement which read:
""As soon as possible after the last day of March in each year the Partners shall make out or cause to be made out an account up to the said last day of March of all the assets and liabilities and profits or losses of the partnership and the same shall be signed by both parties and be binding on them unless some manifest error shall be found by them within three (3) months in which case the same shall be rectified.""
The affidavits of the said Subramaniam Sankaran filed on 14 November 1989 and 13 January 1990 confirmed that he was instructed jointly by the plaintiff and defendant to prepare the statement of account for the period of the partnership from 22 February 1988 to 19 October 1988. It also confirmed that the statement incorporating the valuation of Taha Rushton and Bailey Consultants Pte Ltd was given to the defendant with a copy of the said valuation report on 18 May 1989. The said Subramaniam Sankaran also went through them and explained the same to the defendant. The defendant never raised any objection thereto then or thereafter with the said Subramaniam Sankaran. In my view the defence filed on the accounts is a sham. Accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for this item. Item (iv) for $11,900.00 This is for half of the rent for the premises payable to the landlord, Singapore Airlines Ltd and paid by the plaintiff under the Lease for the period 16 November 1988 to 15 June 1989. The defendant's defence principally was that since he had ceased practice on 20 November 1988, and the plaintiff had been in sole occupation of the premises the defendant was not liable for the rent payable to the landlord. It was not alleged by the defendant that he was denied use or access to the premises of which he was a joint tenant. The premises had an area of 1190 sq ft. This was more than was required by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought unsuccessfully to sublet part of the premises. The plaintiff also requested the defendant to sublet part of the premises occupied by him previously. The defendant failed to do so and failed to return the key to the main door, vide plaintiff's letter of the 20 January 1989 addressed to the defendant care of Lee Jaswant & Partners as the defendant refused to divulge his address in Australia. Para 2 of the same read:
""As you have taken the brief case and the travelling bag, we presume that you are ceasing occupation of your said room with immediate effect. Please therefore make arrangement to let out your room with the consent of the landlord ... ... and return the door key to us for safe keeping.""
As the plaintiff being a joint lessee had to and continued to pay the rent for the premises he is entitled to be reimbursed half of the rents paid by him. The sum of $11,900.00 is calculated up to 15 June 1989. The proceedings herein were commenced on 28 June 1989. In my view the plaintiff is entitled to be so reimbursed.
Accordingly I dismissed the defendant's appeal with costs.",1992-04-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
At the conclusion of the trial on 3 March 1992 I awarded the plaintiff judgment against the defendants in the sum of $200,000 with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ, that is from 18 January 1984 until judgment, together with costs to be taxed unless otherwise agreed. The defendants have filed an appeal against my judgment and I now give my reasons.
The defendants were incorporated in Singapore on 16 October 1979. According to their memorandum and articles of association (exh D1) their objects included the buying and selling of properties and land and also carrying on the business of building contractors and or developers.
The plaintiff (PW1) testified that sometime in November 1981 he was approached by Tay Beng Hock (Tay) for a loan of $200,000 (the loan) for the defendants of which Tay was then the managing director. Prior thereto some three years earlier, the plaintiff had been introduced to Tay by his aunt Madam Lim Geok Eng (PW2) as the plaintiff was then intending to get married and PW2 hoped he would purchase a property developed by the defendants. Tay had in fact shown to PW1 some properties then being developed by the defendants at Phillips Avenue and Geylang. At the worksites, the contractors acknowledged Tay as their boss. Tay requested the loan to enable the defendants to purchase a piece of land. PW1 testified that he did not have the funds so in turn he inquired of PW2 whether she would be interested to make the loan; PW2 agreed.
PW2 testified that she became acquainted with Tay sometime in 1975 through a distant relative of her husband. Tay told her he was a businessman, a managing director of a company and was also involved in the fisheries business. PW2 said she later invested in Tay's fisheries business. Her participation in the business included her advancing to Tay from time to time monies to pay for the import of fish from Thailand.
Having agreed to make the loan, PW2 instructed the plaintiff to see to the proper documentation her reason being that unlike the 'few tens of thousands of dollars' for the fisheries business which she advanced periodically to Tay, this was a very substantial amount. Further, not being literate in English, she requested that the plaintiff use his name as lender in the agreement. Tay agreed and said that the defendants' lawyer Choo Si Sen (DW3) of Tan, Lee & Choo would draw up the agreement.
On the morning of 3 December 1981 PW2 called the plaintiff to say that Tay was picking her up and in turn they would fetch him to go to her bank to withdraw the cash for the loan. After they had picked him up, the plaintiff testified that all three of them proceeded to American Express Bank in Shenton Way. There, PW2 said she withdrew approximately $110,000. Together with another sum of about $100,000 which she had taken from home, PW2 then handed the $200,000 to the Plaintiff in Tay's car. In turn the plaintiff handed the cash to Tay. PW2 then went home whilst the plaintiff and Tay proceeded to the office of Tan, Lee & Choo.
At the office of Tan, Lee & Choo, the plaintiff said he was introduced to DW3 by Tay; in fact everyone at the office including the firm's legal assistant Lee Ah Fong (Lee) knew Tay. After the introduction, Tay explained to DW3 that the plaintiff was lending $200,000 to the defendants and requested that an agreement be prepared to evidence the loan. DW3 in turn instructed Lee to prepare the document (AB5) saying that the agreement must be done properly. After AB5 had been typed it was shown to the plaintiff and DW3 said that if it was acceptable, the agreement would be chopped with the defendants' rubber stamp and stamped. The plaintiff noted that AB5 was addressed to him and his identity card particulars were stated, it had Tay's name typed in with the word 'managing director.' Tay then chopped AB5 with the defendants' rubber stamp, signed it (presumably dated it 3 December 1981) and his signature was then witnessed by DW3 who told the plaintiff that he would arrange to have AB5 stamped by the government which was done subsequently (at $1). Later Tay handed a copy of AB5 to the plaintiff who gave it to PW2.
DW3 testified that he left Tan, Lee & Choo on 1 September 1988 and he could not remember whether he had prepared AB5. An existing partner of the firm Tan Kai Hoe (DW4) testified that he could find no file relating to AB5. Lee who had joined the firm as a salaried partner on 9 September 1981 left on 28 February 1985, neither party called him as a witness.
It was however the common evidence of DW3 and DW4 that :-
(a) Tan, Lee & Choo acted for the defendants (described by DW3 as a small-time developer) for many years since about 1981 although they were not retainer clients. The firm acted for them in the purchase of land and mortgages.
(b) The firm required the defendants' board of directors to pass the requisite resolutions before acting for the defendants in the preparation of mortgages.
(c) The defendants had never borrowed money from individuals, only from financial institutions.
DW3 could not recall signing AB5 although DW4 confirmed that he could recognise the former's signature as witness in the document. DW3 vaguely remembered (and identified her in court) that Tay had brought him to PW2's house at Crescent Road in Katong; he could not recall having met the plaintiff.
The original of AB5 was never produced in court. A copy was produced in court as part of the plaintiff's bundle of documents which by consent of the parties was marked the agreed bundle, the basis of agreement being to dispense with formal proof as well as agreement on the contents. When cross- examined as to why he did not ask for the original of AB5, the plaintiff explained that he was told by Tay that a copy was just as good and the original was with the lawyers. Tay passed away on 2 July 1987.
PW2 testified that Tay told her that the defendants would repay the loan as soon as they had sold some properties they were then developing at Jalan Eunos, Hougang and Geylang. Alternatively if repayment was not made by the date stipulated in AB5 (31 August 1982) the defendants would sell to her a property at a cheaper price. When no repayment was forthcoming from Tay after 31 August 1982, the plaintiff and PW2 became anxious and looked for him both at the defendants' office then at Sin Ming Drive and also at his home; Tay avoided them. According to PW2 this was after November 1981.
Finally the plaintiff decided to seek legal advice. Accordingly his solicitors sent a letter of demand to the defendants. Failing payment by the defendants, the writ in this action was issued on the plaintiff's behalf on 18 January 1984. The defence whilst admitting that AB5 was signed by Tay, denied that the defendants were thereby bound contending that the authority to borrow money by the defendants' board of directors as set out in article 76 of exh D1 had not been delegated to Tay. Paragraph 4 of the defence contended that the loan had in any event been repaid by Tay together with interest calculated at 4.5% per month. As the defendants failed to comply with an order of court dated 12 April 1985 to furnish further and better particulars of para 4 of the defence, the same was struck out by another order of court made on 8 November 1991.
The plaintiff was unsuccessful in his attempt at obtaining summary judgment against the defendants. In those proceedings Tay filed an affidavit on 16 April 1984 acknowledging the loan but contended that the same was given to him in his personal/private capacity and it had nothing to do with the defendants. There was also a further allegation that the loan had been repaid with particulars of the alleged repayment being given by Tay in another affidavit filed on 10 May 1984.
I have already dealt with the evidence of the two witnesses for the plaintiff and I shall now deal with the evidence of the defendnats' other witnesses. Besides DW3 and DW4, the defence called three other witnesses two of which were/are the defendants' directors Lim Ba Hai (DW2) and his younger brother Lim Tek Sin (DW1). It was clear from the evidence of the two brothers that apart from Tay, all the other directors of the defendants had their own business commitments be it selling pork (Lim Su Bok) running a Chinese medicine shop (Ong Kim Cheong) or a petrol kiosk (Chai Ming Chua). They did not work for the defendants on a full time basis. It was further admitted that Tay was the managing director of the defendants if not until his death then certainly until early 1984. Article 93 of exh D1 allowed for the appointment of a managing director for the defendants. Both DW1 and DW2 testified that until the defendants received the plaintiff's solicitors' letter of demand, they and the other directors had no knowledge of the loan and the defendants also never received the money. In any case the defendants did not need to borrow money in 1981. When confronted by them, Tay assured both brothers that the loan had nothing to do with the defendants, he would see their lawyers and attend to the matter personally.
The defendants' auditor Choong Chow Siong (DW5) confirmed that for the period 1975 to date the defendants only raised funds from financial institutions by way of secured loans. Before taking any loan, the directors would hold a board meeting and if a loan tabled at the meeting was accepted then the necessary resolution would be passed and a copy thereof would eventually be handed to him. DW5 testified that in 1981 the defendants did not pass any resolution relating to any loan for $200,000 from the plaintiff. Prior thereto in 1980-1981, the defendants took a loan from a bank.
From the evidence it was common ground that:-
(a) Tay was the managing director of the defendants at the time that the loan was extended by PW2 in the plaintiff's name. (b) Tay undoubtedly deceived both parties in representing to the plaintiff that the defendants needed the loan.
(c) Tan, Lee & Choo were the defendants' lawyers in 1981 and they still act for the defendants. They consulted DW4 on conveyancing matters and DW3 on other matters.
Although DW3 could not confirm that he prepared the document neither did he deny preparing it; there is no doubt on the evidence that it was most probably Lee who prepared AB5. In any event the plaintiff's testimony that it was drafted in the office of the defendants' solicitors was not challenged and I accept as true his evidence of what transpired at their premises on 3 December 1981 < Browne & Dunn (1893) 6 R.67 > . That being the finding, more care should have been taken by DW3 to ensure that AB5 if it was to acknowledge a loan made to a limited company, complied with certain requirements the chief of which (given his own testimony) were that it must be approved by a resolution of the defendants, that Tay was the appointed signatory for the Defendants and if not, that the document was executed under the company's seal. Lee was then a legal assistant/salaried partner having recently joined the defendants' solicitors' firm some three months earlier in September 1981 and according to DW3, Lee assisted him doing mostly criminal work. Given his relative inexperience in particular in corporate/civil matters, Lee should not have been assigned the task of preparing a document upon which the plaintiff relied to protect his aunt's interests. DW3 knew anf if not then he ought to have known this reliance by the very presence of the plaintiff in his office. The fact that no file appeared to have been opened by the firm relating to AB5 (probably because it was done as a favour for a regular client without charge) does not mean that any less care should have been taken in its preparation. I regret to say that no such care was exercised.
This case is a classic example of the application of the rule in < Turquand's > case as derived from < Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E.& B 327 > and further illustrated in < Mahony v East Holyfood Mining Co.(1875) L.R.H.L. 869 > and < Freeman & Lockyer v Bukhurst Park Properties (1964) 2.Q.B.480 > . Is an outsider (in this case the plaintiff) dealing with a company (the defendants) bound to ensure that all the internal regulations of the company have been complied with as regards the exercise and delegation of authority? Based on the authorities, the answer must be in the negative, more so on the facts of this case. Tay's act of borrowing money was not ultra vires the defendants' objects since article 76 (page 16 of exh D1) of their memorandum and articles of association empowered the directors to borrow money. Tay was appointed managing director pursuant to article 93 whilst article 95 (page 17 of exh D1) empowered the directors to confer upon a managing director any of the powers exercisable by them. Even if he did not have the actual authority to do so, Tay certainly had the ostensible authority to borrow for the defendants. Given that AB5 to evidence the loan was prepared by and in the office of,the defendants' solicitors, I do not agree that the plaintiff was under any further obligation as was suggested to him by counsel for the defence, to ensure that there had been compliance by Tay with the company's internal regulations. As was said by Lord Hatherley (at page 894) in < Mahony v East Holyford Mining Co > 
'When there are persons conducting the affairs of the company in a manner which appears to be perfectly consonant with the articles of association, then those so dealing with them, externally, are not to be affected by any irregularities which may take place in the internal management of the company.'
In < Freeman & Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties > it was held that a director who had assumed the powers of managing director with the company's approval although he had never been formally so appointed bound the company by entering into a contract with the plaintiff architects. The act of engaging architects was within the ordinary ambit of the authority of a managing director of a property company and the plaintiffs did not have to inquire whether the person with whom they were dealing was properly appointed; it was sufficient for them that under the articles there was in fact power to appoint him and that the board of directors had allowed him to act as such.
As Tay had passed away by the time this case came to trial, one can only speculate that it was not unexpected of him to have admitted in his affidavit that the loan was taken in his personal capacity rather than as agent for the defendants as taking the latter stand may well have resulted in criminal sanctions against him. On the question which of two innocent parties should suffer the loss, I am of the view that it would be a graver injustice to deny the plaintiff his relief on the ground that he ought to have known the 'indoor mangement' rules of the defendants; the law does not impute any such duty to him. As the defendants chose not to join Tay as a third party to these proceedings which action in any event is timebarred by now, the defendants will have to repay the loan out of their own funds on the judgment which I awarded to the plaintiff.",1992-04-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

This was an application by the plaintiffs to determine whether they, as purchasers, inter alia, of premises known as Units #19-01, #19-02, #19-03, #19-04, #19-05, #19-06, #19 07, #18-01, #18-02, #18-03 and part of Units #18-04 and #18 07 Fortune Centre, 190 Middle Road, Singapore 0718 (hereinafter referred to as ""the premises"") were bound by an agreement entered into between the defendants and their then landlord, Allied Developer Pte Ltd (hereinafter called ""Allied"") around October 1988 for the lease of the said premises for a term of two years with effect from 14 November 1989.
After hearing counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants, I held that the plaintiffs were bound by the said agreement. I now give my reasons.
By an agreement dated 29 June 1989 between City Developments Ltd (hereinafter referred to as ""CDL"") on the one hand and Allied on the other, CDL agreed to purchase from Allied several offices and shop units at the price of just under $22.86m. The purchased units included the premises which were occupied by the defendants. The sale was made subject to existing tenancies, the particulars of which were set out in the second schedule of the agreement.
The schedule was in tabular form containing five columns, respectively headed ""Unit Number"", ""Name of Tenant"", ""Monthly Rent"", ""Term of Tenancy"" and ""Option"". Under the heading Option, against some tenancies where apparently there were no options to renew, there was a dash (-); for others, there appeared ""1"" or ""1 year"" or ""2 years"" or ""3 years"". In respect of the defendants' tenancy, the units let to the defendants were identified with the area and monthly rental respectively stated to be 18,357.36 sq ft and $47,501.10. Against ""Term of Tenancy"" and ""Option"" there appeared ""3 years wef 14/11/86"" followed by a dash (-). The dash was clearly a representation by the vendors, that there was no option for renewal.
The defendants' tenancy had originally been entered into with Golden Fortune Development Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as ""GFD""). GFD subsequently sold the units tenanted by the defendants and other units to Allied. Copies of all the tenancy agreements, including that between GFD and the defendants, were sent to CDL's solicitors on 21 July 1989, together with a request that CDL check the particulars of the tenancies for their accuracy. CDL did check some of the particulars but made no check on the existence of options to renew. Prior to completion on 28 August 1989, CDL expressed the desire to complete the purchase in the name of the plaintiff company which was a subsidiary of CDL. Their wishes were carried out.
The schedule annexed to the agreement of 29 June 1989 was in error not only in giving the impression that the defendants' tenancy agreement had no option to renew. Eight months previous to CDL's agreement to purchase, Allied and the defendants had in fact agreed to changes to the tenancy. By correspondence between the parties in October 1988, the agreed changes were to come into effect, some earlier and others on 14 November 1989 upon expiry of the tenancy agreement specified in the schedule. The area was to be reduced by 943 sq ft and this had in fact taken place in December 1988. The tenancy for the revised area had been extended for a further two years from 14 November 1989 to 13 November 1991 and the rent was reduced to $2.50 per sq ft from an effective rent of $2.70 per sq ft.
In apparent ignorance of these changes effected in October 1988, the plaintiffs, on 18 September 1989, offered the defendants a renewal of the lease of the premises for a further term of two years at an increased rent of $86,279.59 per month. By a fax sent on 22 September 1989, the defendants informed the plaintiffs that the defendants had already agreed with Allied by way of correspondence between 28 September 1988 and 20 October 1988 to renew the lease for two years from 14 November 1989 at the rate of $2.50 per sq ft.
The plaintiffs say this was the first time they had heard of the October 1988 agreement and they asked Allied's solicitors why they had not been informed of the renewal. Allied's solicitors explained that the relevant correspondence had been omitted from the bundle of tenancy agreements sent to the plaintiffs by inadvertent oversight.
Unable to reach agreement on whether the agreement between the defendants and Allied was binding on the plaintiffs, the parties agreed to refer the matter to Court. An application was made for determination of the issue by originating summons No 586 of 1990 filed on 30 May 1990 and the summons came for hearing before me on 10 April 1992.
Before me, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out that the property involved was registered land and hence, the provisions of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157) (""the Act"") applied. He referred me to s 3 of the Act which in effect repeals all laws and practices relating to estates or interests in land as regards registered land in so far as they are inconsistent with the Act. Relying on s 38 of the Act which provides for the paramountcy of the proprietor's estate, he argued that, subject to the applicability of any of the exceptions listed in s 38, the plaintiffs held the land free of the defendants' tenancy as it had not been registered. He stressed that the register was everything and that, save in the case of fraud (and the s 38 exceptions), the Act dispensed with the need of going behind the register in order to investigate title. See s 39 of the Act and the following cases : MCST 446 v Singapura Developments (Pte) Ltd, MC Suit No 753/88 appeal to Chao JC, Waimiha Sawmilling Co. v Waione Timber Co. < 1926 > AC 101, Beesly v Hallwood Estates Ltd < 1960 > 2 All ER 314.
In relation to the question whether any of the s 38 exceptions applied, the only possible exception was s 38(1)(f), which reads:
the rights of any person in occupation of the land under a tenancy when the proprietor became registered as such, provided that the term of the tenancy when created did not exceed 3 years and could not have been extended by exercise of an option of renewal to exceed in the aggregate 3 years; ...
The plaintiffs argued that no matter how one viewed the relationship between the renewal agreement and the option to renew, the defendants did not come within the s 38(1)(f) exception. Firstly, assuming the renewal agreement arose pursuant to the exercise of the option to renew, the defendants were, at the time the plaintiffs became registered as proprietors, in occupation under a tenancy created by the lease dated 23 April 1986 for a term of 3 years (commencing on 14 November 1986) which could be extended by the exercise of an option for renewal for a further 3 years. Hence, the plaintiffs asserted the term would exceed in aggregate 3 years and the defendants would not fall within the ambit of 38(1)(f).
Secondly, even if the renewal agreement did not result from the exercise of the option to renew, they would still not be protected by s 38(1)(f) which requires occupation ""under a tenancy when the proprietor became registered as such"". The plaintiffs were registered as proprietors on 27 August 1989 but on that date, the defendants were in occupation under the tenancy created by the lease dated 23 April 1986. According to the terms of the renewal agreement concluded on 20 October 1988 they were not to commence occupation under it until 14 November 1989.
What the defendants should have done, it was argued for the plaintiffs, was to protect themselves by means of a caveat but this was not done. Hence, the defendants could not enforce against the plaintiffs the rights which they had against Allied.
Counsel for the defendants argued that the plaintiffs were under a duty as purchasers to make inquiries and in this connection, referred me to Hunt v Luck < 1902 > 1 Ch 428, Meenachi Sundram & Anor v Kunjan Pillai < 1955 > 21 MLJ 128 and Ong Heng Hwa Realty Sdn Bhd v Teoh Chai Siok < 1977 > 1 MLJ 124. In the last mentioned case, Syed Agil Barakbah J, relying on Hunt v Luck, said:
It is the duty of the purchaser who has notice that the vendor is not in possession of the property to make inquiries from the tenant in possession and find out from him what his rights are. If he does not choose to do that then whatever title he acquires as purchaser will be subject to the title or right of the tenant in possession.
The two standard tenancy agreement specimens and other tenancy agreements sent by Allied's solicitors had contained option to renew clauses which the plaintiffs would have discovered if they had checked for them as they were bound to do. The plaintiffs could not now be heard to say that they were not aware of such options.
Addressing the plaintiff's arguments centred on the Land Titles Act, counsel stressed that the Act distinguishes between registrable and non-registrable leases. Part VIII of the Act provides for the registration of leases with terms exceeding 3 years. Leases under 3 years are not registrable and s 76(5) provides that:
Nothing in this Part affects the law relating to tenancies for terms not exceeding 3 years.
Hence, there was no need to lodge a caveat to protect short-term tenancies.
In relation to the s 38(1)(f) exception, he stressed that it referred to the term of the tenancy ""when created"". An option to renew, till exercised, was as good as giving a tenant no more than the original term. Hence, the term of the lease should be calculated with reference only to the term existing when the lease was created. In support, counsel pointed out that s 76(3) provides that an option for renewal should not be taken into consideration in determining whether the term of a particular lease exceeds 3 years. Counsel further analyzed the nature of the right that arises when a person falls within the ambit of the sub-section. Such rights are equitable rights. As was said in National Trustees & Co. v Boyd < 1926 > 39 CLR 72, 82, ""An unregistered lease operates not merely to create contractual rights and duties, but to create an equitable term of years and a tenure by estoppel between the lessor and her privies, and the lessee."" Counsel further sought to distinguish the cases cited by counsel for the plaintiffs on the ground that they were concerned with foreign statutes with different wording or were not relevant.
In reply, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the statutes of foreign jurisdictions that he had cited were substantially in pari materia with local legislation and that although the exceptions varied among the jurisdictions, the manner of approach of the courts should be the same. He further cited comments in Woodman and Nellie's The Torrens System in New South Wales made in relation to s 42(d) of the New South Wales Real Property Act 1900 < roughly corresponding to our s 38(f) > , as follows:
It is important to note that a lease for a period not exceeding three years and containing an option to renew, so that the term of the lease and the option when compounded exceed three years, does not require registration under s 53(1) ... However, such a lease does not come within the provisions of s 42(1)(d), and hence should be protected either by registration or lodgment of a caveat.
As s 104 of the Land Titles Act provides for the lodgment of caveats, the defendants should have lodged a caveat to protect their interests. Counsel sought to distinguish Ong Heng Hwa on the ground that the National Land Code was based on a different approach to the Land Titles Act. The former preserved part of the former law, whereas the latter repealed the old law in so far as it was inconsistent with the provisions of the Act in its application to registered land.
Furthermore, the estoppel cases cited were cases in which the argument prevailed against the landlord directly, not against the landlord's successor in title who was unaware of the previous owner's doings. The defendants would have a remedy against the original lessor since ""the lessor remains bound by his covenant despite a sale of the freehold reversion. He will, therefore, be liable in damages to the tenant for the purchaser's refusal to renew"": Barnsley's Conveyancing Law and Practice.
In reply, counsel for the defendant argued that the New South Wales legislation was distinguishable from our legislation. In particular, the former legislation provided no means for computing time.
I agreed with the gist of the submissions of counsel for the defendants. Part VIII of the Act provides that nothing in it affects the law relating to tenancies for terms not exceeding 3 years. In this way, the Land Titles Act expressly provides that the validity of such agreements are not affected, as does the National Land Code, its Malaysian counterpart. Equity will give effect to such tenancies: see National Trustees & Co. v Boyd (1926) 39 CLR 72, 82. The Ong Heng Hwa Realty case applied this equitable principle to a vendor's successor in title for ""... It is the duty of the purchaser who has notice that the vendor is not in possession of the property to make inquiries form the tenant in possession and find out from him what his rights are"". In both that case and the present case, this duty was not carried out. Thus, ""... whatever title he acquires as purchaser will be subject to the title or right of the tenant in possession"" (Ong Heng Hwa Realty applying Hunt v Luck). In the present case, the plaintiffs' title is therefore subject to the defendants' rights under the tenancy agreement as revised in October 1988 between GFD and the defendants.
Having indicated my decision to the parties, I invited them to bring me a draft order which properly described the units tenanted by the defendants with the deposit for the tenanted area as revised by the October 1988 agreement worked out. They did this and I accordingly declared and ordered:
(1) that the plaintiffs as purchasers of premises known as Units #19-01, #19-02, #19-03, #19-04, #19-05, #19-06, #19-07, #18-01, #18-02, #18-03 and part of Units #18-04 and $18-07 Fortune Centre, 190 Middle Road, Singapore 0718 (hereinafter referred to as ""the premises"") from one Allied Developer Pte Ltd (hereinafter called ""Allied"") are bound by an agreement entered into between the defendants and their landlord, the said Allied in or about October 1988 for the lease of the said premises for a term of two (2) years with effect from 14 November 1989 to 13 November 1991 at the rate of $2.50 per sq ft. (2) That the plaintiffs execute accordingly a lease in favour of the defendants incorporating the terms of the agreement and all the other terms and conditions contained in the lease dated 23 April 1986 and entered into between Golden Fortune Development Pte Ltd and the defendants which do not conflict with the said terms of the agreement except that the proviso for renewal contained in clause 9(c) of the said Lease dated 23 April 1986 shall be deleted. (3) That since the rental deposit of $300,283.20 presently held by the plaintiffs is in excess of the amount of the deposit payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs pursuant to the Agreement, the plaintiffs refund to the defendants the sum of $36,388.20 being the amount of such excess. (4) That the plaintiffs pay the defendants the costs of these proceedings to be taxed.
Before I conclude, I wish to draw attention to the content of affidavits. The rule that affidavits must be confined to fact is clear. If I may paraphrase words from Megarry VC and Roskill LJ from a judgment of each which I will be citing, the purpose of affidavits is to provide evidence, that is to say, to place facts, whether disputed or otherwise, before the tribunal for whose help they are prepared. They are not designed as a receptacle for or as a vehicle for argument.
The passages I propose to cite refer to law and legal argument but what was said equally applies to argument on facts or argument the credibility of other deponents. Argument or submission on fact and credibility should be conveyed to the tribunal by advocates in oral or written submission.
One deponent had, in his affidavit, these passages, some of which are of mixed law and fact, in his affidavit:-
(a) ... I find the plaintiffs' position entirely strange. (b) If < the plaintiffs have not perused the original tenancy agreement > they clearly have only themselves to blame. (c) I wonder if the plaintiffs are saying < XYZ > . (d) Clearly the < plaintiffs' stand is > untenable. (e) The plaintiffs' stand ... is entirely lame and untenable. (f) ... the plaintiffs' stand ... I find equally surprising. (g) ... I humbly submit the plaintiffs are clearly lying when they say ...
In Gleeson v J Wippell & Co. Ltd < 1977 > 3 All ER 54 at 63-c5, Megarry VC said:
< ... one affidavit > displays undesirable features that I think ought not to be allowed to pass unchecked. In Mr Brown's affidavit he quotes a passage from an opinion of a silk and he exhibits an article in a journal concerned with patents. The object appears to be to demonstrate that the plaintiff has prospects of success against Wippell if her action is not halted. The main objection to the extracts from the article is that they do not appear to me to constitute any evidence; and the purpose of affidavits is, or should be, to provide evidence. As I told counsel for the plaintiff, I would listen with pleasure to any submission on the subject that he chose to put before me, whatever his source of inspiration, but I would not listen to the words of a Queen's Counsel, however eminent, or the author of an article, when proffered as evidence of the legal rights and prospects of a litigant. A court does not hear expert evidence on what the law of England is, or what the rights of parties are under that law. In any case, extracts from counsel's opinion are usually valueless, or worse, without the rest of the opinion and the instructions on which it was based, to show what the opinion was founded on and what reservations and qualifications there are.
Roskill LJ dealt with the legal argument in affidavits when he said, in Alfred Dunhill Ltd v Sunoptics SA < 1979 > FSR 337 at 352:
I hope it is not out of place to say at this stage that the affidavits filed on both sides are in at least two cases very much too long. Affidavits are designed to place facts, whether disputed or otherwise, before the tribunal for whose help they are prepared. They are not designed as a receptacle for or as a vehicle for legal arguments. Draftsmen of affidavits should not, as a general rule, put into the mouths of the intended deponents legal arguments of which those deponents are unlikely ever to have heard. Legal arguments, especially in interlocutory proceedings, should come from the mouths of those best qualified to advance them and not be put into the mouths of the deponents. There has been much unnecessary paper in this case brought about by the inclusion of legal arguments in affidavits.
With necessary modifications, what Megarry VC and Roskill LJ have said equally applies to argument on fact or the credibility of other witnesses or deponents. This should be borne in mind by the draftsmen of affidavits. Last three pages of the judgment dated 24 June 1992 of Punch Coomaraswamy J in OS 586.90.",1992-06-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

ORAL JUDGMENT
Francis Tan Meng Chiang is a director. The business of the defendants is to manufacture gold jewellery and diamond jewellery. Francis became a director in 1978. Before 1978, he was aware that his father had business transactions with the plaintiff who was a broker when his father managed the family business. With the passage of time, Francis came to know the plaintiff through the dealings his father had with the plaintiff.
The plaintiff, although he was a broker with the defendants' company, was also permitted to take jewellery to sell to other customers. When jewellery was taken for sale, sometimes up to the value of $40,000, all that the plaintiff had to do was to sign a consignment note. The plaintiff was a trusted broker of the defendants' company of many years' standing. Where jewellery was taken and remained unsold, it was always properly returned.
After 1981, Francis got to know the plaintiff personally. The plaintiff would contact him over the telephone and talked about commission and the like without difficulty. The plaintiff introduced many individual clients to the defendants' company for which commission was paid.
When a lot of Arab customers started to come from the Middle East, Francis asked the plaintiff, who speaks Arabic, to introduce him to the plaintiff's customers. Francis wanted customers introduced who would not only buy but also design items of jewellery from the defendants' company. The plaintiff's part was to introduce customers. Where there was purchase and payment for goods purchased, commission would be paid at the agreed rate.
The commission as promised by Francis was for as long as customers were brought to the defendants' company. All that the customers were expected to do was to purchase the jewellery from the defendants' company. The commission was paid when introduction took place and the agreement that existed, was, according to the plaintiff, that once a customer had been introduced, commission would be paid for every subsequent purchase. The defendants had a slightly different version, but it goes to details that can wait.
On 17 April 1984, the parties entered into an agreement which was reduced into writing. This is the subject of the claim. The terms of the letter of undertaking under the Defendants' letterhead is as follows:
Letter of Undertaking This is to confirm that we shall pay a commission of ten (10) cents Singapore per gram for any purchases of 21K gold jewellery effested (sic) by M/S AL6Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd of No. 5 Shenton Way, #29-08, UIC Building, Singapore 0105 to M/S Hassan Bin Omar Alkhatib, I/C No 0633764/C of 723 North Bridge Road, Singapore 0719
JUMBO CRAFTS (PTE) LTD
Signed Director
Dated this 17/4/84
Under this agreement, the defendants paid $75,487.75 commission over the period 5 March 1984 to 27 May 1985 to the plaintiff. Prior to this contract, the defendants had not paid commission to the plaintiff at the rate of S10 per gram. Previously the commission was normally paid where there were individual purchases at the rate of 2% to 5%. There was also some dispute over the currency, but that need not detain us.
Before the agreement was signed, a meeting took place in the defendants' premises sometime in February or March 1984 after the plaintiff had had a telephone conversation with Francis. The meeting took place one or two weeks after the telephone conversation. The persons who arrived at the defendants' premises were the plaintiff, Lotfi (the General Manager) and one Lajam who is the son-in-law of the plaintiff who is related to Lotfi. The plaintiff took Lotfi and Lajam up to the reception desk in the defendants' company and there introduced Lotfi and Lajam to Francis, saying that Lotfi, and referring to Lajam as Faisal, are from Al-Romaizan. According to the defendants, nothing more was said and the plaintiff then left. According to the plaintiff, he stayed for the duration of the meeting but that he was a listener. The meeting took place in the conference room and lasted about thirty minutes. I accept the plaintiff's version.
The defendants' case is that the letter of 17 April 1984 does not contain the full terms and conditions for the payment of the commission.
In the alternative, the defendants say that it was an implied term and/or condition and/or to be inferred from the letter of 17 April 1984 that the alleged commission is payable on:
(a) the plaintiff at material times being able to procure the custom of M/s Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd (hereinafter referred to as ""Al-Romaizan"") to make the purchase of the said gold jewellery from the defendants; (b) the plaintiff at all material times being able to get and/or ensure that payment by the said Al-Romaizan would be prompt without having the defendants to chase for payment; and (c) the plaintiff being the effective cause of the purchase of the said gold jewellery from the defendants.
The defendants say that in order to induce the defendants to sign the letter of 17 April 1984, the plaintiff represented to the defendants:
(a) that at all material times the plaintiff was able to procure the custom of the said Al-Romaizan to purchase the said gold jewellery from the defendants; and
(b) that at all material times the plaintiff would be able to ensure that the payment for the purchase of the said gold jewellery by the said Al-Romaizan would be prompt.
The said representations, it has been pleaded, were made by and are to be inferred from:
(a) the letter of 17 April 1984; and (b)oral statements made by the plaintiff to the defendants prior to 17 April 1984 notwithstanding the fact that it is also the defendants' evidence that the plaintiff did no more than introduce the parties when they were first introduced, and left them together when he is supposed to have made false representations to Francis about the many things he could do.
The defendants say that acting on the faith and truth of the representations and induced thereby the defendants signed the letter dated 17 April 1984 and paid to the plaintiff money totalling $75,487.75. The defendants also say that the plaintiff made representations fraudulently knowing that they were false and untrue or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false. The defendants also rely on the provisions of s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act, 1967 as entitling the defendants to the relief claimed in their defence and counterclaim. The defendants say that when the defendants discovered that the said representations were untrue, the defendants rescinded the contract. The solicitor's letter dated 11 September 1985 was sent terminating the letter of undertaking dated 17 April 1984. The solicitor's letter, no doubt, written after instructions were given is as follows:
Our Ref: TKM/Misc/85

MR Hassan Bin Omar Alkhatib 723 North Bridge Road Singapore 0719
Dear Sir
Re: NOTICE OF TERMINATION
We act for Jumbo Craft Pte Ltd.
We refer to the agreement by our client dated 17.4.84 to pay you commission in respect of gold jewellery bought from our client by Messrs. Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd of No. 5 Shenton Way, #29-08, UIC Building, Singapore 0105.
We are instructed to and do hereby give you notice that with immediate effect our client is terminating the said agreement and henceforth our client will not be paying you commission for any gold jewellery bought by Messrs. Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd.
Yours faithfully
Signed.
cc. client.
The letter of 11 September 1985, however, does not make any reference to the fact that the agreement set out in the letter dated 17 April 1984 does not contain the full terms, that the defendants were induced by misrepresentations made by the plaintiff and money paid was due to them. The letter does not make any reference to representations being made fraudulently or that the defendants will rely upon s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act.
The defendants also say that on a proper construction of the letter of 17 April 1984, the defendants are not an accounting party to the plaintiff or in any way accountable to the plaintiff and if the defendants should be an accounting party, the commission rate is not as alleged in the statement of claim.
The defendants say that the plaintiff, if at all, is entitled to a commission at the rate of S5 per gram for the purchase of 21K gold jewellery by the said Al-Romaizan as agreed subsequently with effect from 12 January 1985, a change brought about by a reduction in workmanship fees. Payment was made to the plaintiff from 12 January 1985 to 27 May 1985 based on the new rate of 5 per gram. There is a dispute as to whether the plaintiff had accepted the change. The fact remains that the plaintiff was supplied with copies of documents from which the change could be inferred.
This is a case where the relationship of the parties goes back a considerable period. The trust that existed between the plaintiff and the defendants was a very special one. The relationship that the plaintiff had with the father and the trust and confidence he had with the father, was, in a manner of speaking, inherited and accepted by Francis, and reciprocated by the plaintiff.
Francis asked the plaintiff to introduce customers from Trengganu and Brunei to the defendants' company by bringing them to the shop. Rightly or wrongly, the plaintiff began to suspect that the commission he was paid without default in the past was not being paid properly. He had good reason to want to put the agreement into writing. Al-Romaizan was not an ordinary customer. The transactions were different. The estimated sales, looking at 40 kilos per month, is in the region of $1.632 million dollars.
The letter of undertaking is clear. The object sought to be achieved in construing any contract is to ascertain what the mutual intentions of the parties were as to the legal obligations each assumed by the contractual words in which they sought to express them. What must be ascertained is to be taken as the intention which reasonable people would have had if placed in the situation of the parties. See Reardon-Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen < 1976 > 1 WLR 989. A similar point was made in McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd < 1964 > 1 WLR 125 where Lord Reid said:
The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party, it is to decide what each was reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.
In Codefa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales (1982) 149 CLR 337, Mason J said:
... when the issue is which of two or more possible meanings is to be given to a contractual provision we look not to the actual intentions, aspirations or expectations of the parties before or at the time of the contract, except in so far as they are expressed in the contract, but to the objective framework of facts within which the contract came into existence, and to the parties' presumed intention in this setting. We do not take into account the actual intentions of the parties and for the very good reason that an investigation of those matters would not only be time consuming but would also be unrewarding as it would tend to give too much weight to these factors at the expense of the actual language of the contract.
Sir John Donaldson M R explained the unimportance of the actual intentions of the parties in Summit Investment Inc v British Steel Corporation < 1987 > l Lloyds' Rep. 230 at 233:
their actual intentions are happily irrelevant, since, were it otherwise, many, and perhaps most, disputes upon points of construction would be resolved by holding that the parties were not ad idem.
For the purpose of construing the contract before me, the intention of the parties is in the meaning of the words they have used. There is no intention independent of that meaning. I must ascertain the intention from the language they have used in the light of the surrounding circumstances and the object of the contract in so far as that had been agreed and proved.
The letter of 17 April 1984 was first put up as a draft at the defendants' request. The letter was typed at the defendants' office after he had made amendments. The defendants signed it and made payments on it.
In Leggott v Barrett (1880) 15 Ch D 306, Brett LJ said:
... where there is a preliminary contract in words which is afterwards reduced into writing, or where there is a preliminary contract in writing which is afterwards reduced into a deed, the rights of the parties are governed in the first case entirely by the writing, and in the second case entirely by the deed; and if there be any difference between the words and the written document in the first case, or between the written agreement and the deed in the other case, the rights of the parties are entirely governed by the superior document and by the governing part of that document.
There is a dispute as to whether the contract is wholly in writing. I find the contract is wholly in writing. Where a contract is made wholly in writing, evidence is not admissible to add to, vary or contradict the written terms unless there is fraud. I find no fraud. The plaintiff had a son-in-law working for Al-Romaizan. The son-in-law is related to the General Manager, Lotfi. The undisputed facts are that Francis was told that the General Manager would be coming to the defendants' premises when Francis, after his 1981 trip to Saudi Arabia, wanted to do business with Al-Romaizan. The plaintiff introduced Al-Romaizan to the defendants.
The court in construing any written agreement is entitled to look at evidence of the objective factual document known to the parties at or before the date of the contract and objectively the aim of the transaction. But this does not entitle the court to look at the evidence of the parties subjective intentions.
The workmanship fees per gram for Al-Romaizan was US$1 in 1983 and steadily went down to US70 whereas the commission of the plaintiff remained constant. The defendants' relationship with the General Manager became closer. Playing up to him would make all the difference. It is not surprising that the defendants found themselves in a difficult position when Al-Romaizan applied pressure to reduce workmanship fees. A need to wriggle out of a bad bargain existed. The relationship with Lotfi promised a way out.
Workmanship Fees Per Gram For Al-Romaizan Dates Workmanship Per Gram 1983 - 31.10.84 US$1.00 1.11.84 - 28.11.84 US$0.90 22.1.85 - 28.6.85 US$0.87 24.7.85 - 16.9.85 US$0.83 14.10.85 - 30.5.86 US$0.80 2.9.86 - 3.3.87 US$0.77 5.3.87 - 4.6.88 US$0.70
Al-Romaizan was a big customer, but it is clear from the evidence of Lotfi that he also drove a hard bargain. What at first appeared as a profitable arrangement, with time, became less and less profitable.
It is in the above context that Francis reduced the rate of commission from 10"" to 5"". The plaintiff denies there was such an agreement. The documentary evidence, however, makes it clear that the commission was being paid at 5 per gram. The evidence of Lotfi Ababaker Abdullah and Francis on some matters are not satisfactory. Francis had no answer to an important question. I will say no more at this stage and will give fuller grounds for my decision at a later stage, if that should become necessary. The recission of the contract of 17 April 1984 by the defendants is not valid.
I make the following orders: 
(1) There will be an order for the following accounts to be taken, that is to say: (a) an account to be taken of all sales effected by the defendants to M/s Al-Romaizan (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd and of the amount of commission due thereon to the plaintiff on the sales effected; (b) an account to be taken of the commission due to the plaintiff at the rate of: (i) S10"" per gram for all purchases of 21K gold jewellery from 17 April 1984 up to 12 January 1985; and (ii) thereafter at S5"" per gram for all purchases of 21K gold jewellery effected by M/s Al- Romaizon (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd. 
(2) Defendants to pay the plaintiffs all sums due to the plaintiff by way of commission on the accounts taken.
(3) Interest on the commission from due date of the commission at 6%.
(4) Costs. 
(5) The defendants' counterclaim is dismissed with costs. 
(6) By consent, decision in this suit determines the rights and claims of the parties in Suit No 1379/86.",1992-04-29 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
This was an application made under s.21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 1990 Ed.) for the admission of Stuart Lindsay Isaacs, QC, to practise as an advocate and solicitor for the purpose of appearing as leading counsel in Civil Appeal No 78 of 1990 (""the appeal"") on behalf of the respondents therein and in all other proceedings relating to or arising from the appeal. The application was made on 20 May 1992. The appeal has been fixed for hearing by the Court of Appeal on 13 July 1992. I made no order on the application. The applicant has appealed against my decision and I now give my reasons.
The appellants did not object to the application as they have also made a similar application in Originating Motion No. 43 of 1992 for the admission of Michael David Thomas, QC, for the purpose of appearing as leading counsel for them in the same appeal. No objection was also made by the Law Society.
Counsel for the Attorney General objected to the admission on the ground that the applicant does not have the special qualifications or experience within the meaning of s. 21(1)(c) of the Act for the purpose of arguing the appeal. It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the applicant should be such a person who, as a lawyer and on the evidence before the court, exhibits distinguished qualities or is devoted to a particular branch or field of law and Mr Isaacs does not have the special qualifications or experience in the field of shipping law. The appeal involves the interpretation of the Caspanian clause in a bill of lading and leading counsel should be able to make a detailed analysis of the development of the law of bills of lading. The appeal would also involve arguments on the tort of detinue and its application to shipping cases. The appeal also involves the interpretation of s.294 of the Merchant Shipping Act and counsel arguing the point would need to have some knowledge of the policy reasons and history of Merchant Shipping Acts.
In Originating Motion No. 43 of 1992, I made no order on the application for the admission of Mr Michael David Thomas, QC, because I was not satisfied that the issues which are raised in the appeal are of sufficient difficulty and complexity which requires a Queen's Counsel to be admitted to argue the appeal. Although the respondent and the interested parties did not object to the application on the ground that the appeal is of sufficient difficulty and complexity, section 21(1) of the Act makes it clear that it is incumbent upon the parties to satisfy the court that the issues raised in the appeal must be of sufficient difficulty and complexity. As the Attorney General is also the trial judge who heard the case from which the appeal arose, I do not think he was in a position to raise an objection on that ground that the appeal does not raise issues which are of sufficient difficulty and complexity which requires a Queen's Counsel to be admitted to argue the appeal. I have identified the issues in the appeal in my Grounds of Decision for Originating Motion No. 43 of 1992 and it is not necessary for me to repeat them.
Furthermore, having regard to the fact that the case was argued before the learned trial judge by G P. Selvam (as he then was) and Miss Anjali Iyer on behalf of the appellants and by H. C. Hiew and Nicholas Woo on behalf of the respondents, which clearly shows that the parties and their solicitors were clearly of the view that the questions of fact and law which arose at the trial were not of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require the appearance of Queen's Counsel and the fact that the admission of Mr Isaacs is sought for arguing an appeal before the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that the circumstances of the case do not merit the admission of Queen's Counsel to argue the appeal. Even if the appeal raises difficult and complex issues of law, there is no reason to believe that local counsel would not be able to address the Court of Appeal adequately. It is also the practice of the Court of Appeal to request counsel for the parties to an appeal to file written submissions. If the parties to the appeal feel that they should have the best legal advice available, they can consult Queen's Counsel and their local counsel can adopt the opinions from Queen's Counsel as part of their written submissions which will be filed with the Court of Appeal. In this age of modern technology, Queen's Counsel can easily be reached by means of the facsimile or telex machine.
As for the question whether Mr Isaacs has the ""special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case"" within the meaning of s. 21(1)(c) of the Act, I had informed the parties concerned at the hearing that it would not be necessary for me to decide on the question since I am not satisfied that the two requirements of s. 21 of the Act have been met, namely (a) that the case must be of sufficient difficulty and complexity; and (2) having regard to the circumstances of the case.
Accordingly for the reasons given above, I made no order on the application.",1992-06-12 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
This was an application made under s. 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 1990 Ed.) for the admission of Michael David Thomas, QC to practise as an advocate and solicitor for the purpose of appearing as leading counsel in Civil Appeal No 78 of 1990 (""the appeal"") on behalf of the appellants therein and in all other proceedings relating to or arising from the appeal. The application was made on 20 May 1992. The appeal has been fixed for hearing by the Court of Appeal on 13 July 1992.
It was not and could not be disputed that Mr Thomas had the special qualifications for the appeal. The respondents did not object to the application as they have also made a similar application in Originating Motion 51 of 1992 for the admission of Stuart Lindsay Isaacs, QC for the purpose of appearing as leading counsel for them in the same appeal. No objection was also made by the Attorney General and the Law Society.
The appellants in the appeal are the owners of the ship or vessel ""KOTA SEJARAH"". The appeal is against a decision of Chan Sek Keong, J. (as he then was) given on 10 August 1990. The learned trial judge gave judgment for the respondents in the sum of US$339,822.00 with interest thereon at the rate of 8% p.a. and costs.
Section 21(1) of the Legal Profession Act, as amended by Act No 10 of 1991, reads as follows:
""21.-(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court may, for the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of sufficient difficulty and complexity and having regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who -
(a) holds Her Majesty's Patent as Queen's Counsel;
(b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and
(c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case."". (Emphasis added)
The words in italics were added to the above subsection by Act No. 10 of 1991.
The object of Act No 10 of 1991 for introducing those amendments was described by S. K. Chan, J. in Originating Motion No 16 of 1991 (unreported) as follows:
""The object of Act No. 10 of 1991 was to lay the foundation for the development of a strong local bar by the imposition of more stringent conditions for the admission of Queen's Counsel to appear in our courts but at the same time to allow litigants to avail of their services in appropriate cases. The function of the courts is to maintain a proper balance between the two competing interests. Prior to the amendment, the primary consideration for admission of a Queen's Counsel was whether he had special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case. The court was seldom required to exercise its general discretion against admission as it was a common practice of solicitors for the parties not to object to each other's applications. The new law requires the court to take into consideration two additional requirements: (1) the case must be of sufficient difficulty and complexity; and (2) having regard to the circumstances of the case.
With reference to the first requirement, it is the judge, and not the parties, or their counsel, or other interested parties, who has to be satisfied that a case is of sufficient difficulty and complexity. The considered views of instructing solicitors on the issues raised are relevant and should be given their proper weight, but mere assertions that the cases or issues are difficult and complex are of no assistance to the court in discharging its duty. It is therefore incumbent on counsel to identify the issues the the judge hearing the application and his views on the applicable law. A case may be difficult and complex in relation to the facts as well as the law. < emphasis added > 
The second requirement can only be considered on a case by case basis. As circumstances vary from case to case, no more need be said about this requirement."".
The above observations were made by Chan, J. in relation to an application for the admission of David Keightley Rideal Oliver, QC. for the purpose of appearing in Suit No 147 of 1991 on behalf of the plaintiffs therein.
Since s. 21(1) of the Legal Profession Act makes it clear that it is the judge, and not the parties, or their counsel, or other interested parties, who has to be satisfied that a case is of sufficient difficulty and complexity, I asked counsel for the applicant to identify the issues which she considered to be of sufficient difficulty and complexity. Having read the affidavit filed by applicant in support of this application, the judgment of S.K. Chan, J. (reported in < 1991 > 1 M.L.J. 136) and hearing the issues identified by counsel for the applicant, I made no order on the application as I was not satisfied that the appeal raises issues of law or fact of sufficient difficulty or complexity, and having regard to the circumstances of the case, I should exercise my discretion to admit Michael David Thomas to practise as an advocate and solicitor for the purposes of appearing as leading counsel in the appeal. I said I would give my reasons later.
The Facts
The brief facts of the case as they are found by the learned trial judge are as follows. In August 1978 the respondents bought 1,000 metric tons of jute from a Thai company, and at about the same time resold the same to a German company controlled by Iranians for delivery to Khorramshahr in Iran. Cargo space was booked on the appellants' vessel, the Kota Sejarah, and the goods were loaded on board on 3 January 1979. Two clean bills of lading (`KR-3' and `KR-4') were issued for the goods. The vessel sailed for Bangkok on 6 January 1979 and arrived at Basra, Iran, on 26 January 1979. Due to congestion caused by a stevedores' and port workers' strike on account of political unrest, the ship could not berth at Khorramshahr. After two weeks at Basra, the appellants invoked cl. 5 of the bills of lading, abandoned the voyage and selected Porbander, India, as the port of discharge.
On 13 February 1979, the respondents telexed the appellants that the Iranian buyers had rejected the invocation of cl. 5 and held the appellants responsible for all consequences. On 19 February 1979 the respondents telexed the appellants' agent in India (""JM"") informing JM that they were the holders of the bills of lading, KR-3 and KR-4, and inquiring about, inter alia, the insurance of the goods. On 1 March 1979, the appellants telexed the respondents that because of the difficultly in obtaining insurance cover except for fire, lightning, explosion and flood, the `receivers' should arrange for their own insurance. The appellants also inquired of the respondents whether they or the receivers wished to make their own arrangements for forwarding the goods to Khorramshahr or to arrange with JM on their behalf and further requested that they be advised as to what the receivers intended in regard to the forwarding of the goods and on the insurance.
On 6 March 1979, the respondents' director (PW1) met JM's director (DW1) and discussed various matters relating to the cargo. There are material disputes on what was said by each party or agreed between them.
On 9 May 1979, the respondents tried unsuccessfully to telex the appellants' about the current position relating to the ownership of the cargo. The respondents telexed JM the next day to relay a message to the appellants that they are the holders of the bills of lading and owners of the cargo resulting from a situation in which the buyers have defaulted and they are in the process of reselling the cargo elsewhere and that the appellants are to instruct JM not to remove the cargo without the respondents' written approval. JM relayed the message on the same day.
On 11 May 1979, the appellants telexed the respondents, that, inter alia, it was too late to comply with their request as the cargo had been loaded on the Kota Agung destined for Khorramshahr. The respondents then telexed JM that they did not want the cargo to be loaded. JM replied that the cargo had been loaded, the ship was sailing the next day and the cargo could not be discharged, even at the respondents' expense. The respondents then replied that as the appellants had declared Porbander as their final port of discharge under cl. 5 of the bills of lading, they are holding all parties concerned responsible for loading the cargo without their approval. They further protested and reserved their right to take all legal action against all parties concerned as PW1, in the meetings with DW1, had explained the respondents' position and arranged for insurance, etc for warehousing the cargo.
The respondents then telexed the appellants to put on record, inter alia, that the appellants had declared Porbander as the final port of discharge; JM had been informed of the respondents' ownership of the cargo and no one should deal with the cargo without their prior written approval; and PW1 had met DW1 in Bombay on two occasions and the latter had agreed nothing will be moved without the respondents' written approval. The respondents further insisted that the appellants off-load the cargo and held the appellants responsible for all consequences, losses, etc.
After checking with JM, the appellants telexed the respondents on 12 May 1979 that the respondents had never responded to their earlier telexes asking for instructions whether they or the receivers wish to make any arrangement for forwarding the cargo to Khorramshahr and they therefore made arrangements to forward the cargo to Khorramshahr. The appellants further stated that they were never aware of the respondents' claim as owners and that JM agreed (which is denied) not to remove the cargo from Porbander without the respondents' written approval. To assert title to the goods, the appellants insisted that the respondents must present the relevant bills of lading or alternatively furnish the appellants with an indemnity guaranteed by a Singapore bank in order that the appellants can comply with their request for delivery.
By a further exchange of telexes between the respondents' solicitors and the appellants, the appellants were informed that the respondents were unable to find a buyer in Khorramshahr and the cargo must not be discharged at that port but be returned to Porbander or shipped to Singapore or Bangkok. The appellants replied that they did not admit the respondents' title to the goods unless bills of lading were presented to them and that they will deliver the goods to the party presenting valid bills of lading.
Various allegations and counter-allegations were exchanged between the parties, the net result of which was that the parties reached an agreement, without prejudice, to have the goods reshipped to Bangkok at an agreed freight rate.
Unfortunately, the Kota Agung, on arrival in Khorramshahr, caught fire in the course of unloading its cargo, resulting in the total constructive loss of the goods. The respondents sued the appellants for the loss and damage to their cargo.
The Respondents' Case
The respondents' case against the appellants was as follows:
(a) The appellants breached their contractual duty under the two bills of lading, KR-3 and KR-4, as carriers by sea for reward and as bailees or any of them when they abandoned the Kota Sejarah voyage to Khorramshahr pursuant to cl. 5 of the said bills of lading and deviated and discharged the cargo at Porbander.
(b) The appellants converted, wrongfully detained and trespassed the cargo or committed any of the said torts by removing the cargo from Porbander and loading it onto the Kota Agung.
(c) The appellants converted, wrongfully detained and trespassed the cargo or committed any of those torts by not unloading the cargo from the Kota Agung and retaining it in Porbander.
(d) The appellants, their servants or agents were negligent and/or failed to properly and carefully carry and/or keep and/or care for the cargo in accordance with Article III Rule 2 of the Hague Rules.
The Appellants' Defence
The appellants' defence was as follows:
(a) They were entitled under the provisions of the bills of lading to abandon the ""Kota Sejarah"" voyage to Khorramshahr, divert the Kota Sejarah to and discharge the cargo at Porbander instead. The appellants did not abandon the cargo.
(b) The appellants were entitled to, under the provisions of the bills of lading and obliged to under the Indian laws and regulations and/or the prevailing circumstances to tranship the cargo to Khorramshahr on the ""Kota Agung"". Further the respondents' ownership of the cargo and right to possession (subject to applicable laws and production of original bills of lading) was never denied by the appellants. Accordingly, the respondents could have no claim for conversion, wrongful detention and trespass or any of those causes of action.
(c) The duty of care owed under the Hague Rules came to an end when the ""Kota Sejarah"" voyage was abandoned and the cargo discharged at Porbandar. Thereafter the appellants owed to the respondents only the duty to use reasonable care in the custody of the cargo which they did.
(d) Even if the Hague Rules applied, the appellants say that neither they nor their agents nor servants were negligent or in breach of the duty to carefully stow and carry the cargo in accordance therewith.
(e) Even if the agents and/or agents of the appellants were negligent, the loss, resulting from a fire, occurred without the appellants' actual fault or privity. The appellants are therefore entitled to rely on s. 294 of the Merchant Shipping Act which overrides any negligence, bailee's duty of care or unseaworthiness of the vessel.
Findings of the learned trial judge
The learned trial judge gave judgment for the respondents on the following grounds:
(a) The crucial question (pertaining to cl. 5 of the bills of lading) is whether the power to tranship the goods is cumulative with or alternative with the power to abandon the voyage. As a matter of construction, cl. 5 did not permit the appellants to tranship the goods to Khorramshahr after the appellants had elected to abandon the voyage and discharged the goods at Porbander.
(b) The appellants had no authority to load the goods on the Kota Agung unless the respondents had requested transhipment. Silence does not express consent. There is no implied agreement to tranship.
(c) The question of the appellants reserving their right to tranship also does not arise. Assuming that cl. 5 gave such a right, the appellants made no such reservation which was communicated to the respondents. The evidence shows that the appellants' intention in invoking cl. 5 was to abandon the voyage (which they effected by discharging all the cargo at Porbander). Further, on a balance of probabilities, PW1 did not expressly instruct DW1 concerning the removal of the goods from the warehouse at Porbander.
(d) Detinue is still a common law tort in Singapore and has not been, unlike in England, abrogated by statute and converted into a form of statutory conversion. As PW1 had not at any time prior to 11 May 1979 expressly instructed DW1 not to remove the goods from the warehouse, the appellants had not done anything wrong in relation to the goods at the time of removal and up to the time it was loaded on board the Kota Agung. Further, on the evidence, there was no detinue as the appellants did not actually refuse to deliver the goods to the respondents.
(e) Assuming that cl. 5 did give the appellants a contractual right or power to tranship after abandonment of a voyage, it is still necessary to consider whether this power was capable of being revoked by the respondents at any time before it was exercised. In principle, the right or power is revocable. After the abandonment of the voyage, the owners of cargo are entitled to take the goods at the place where the goods are landed. An irrevocable power to tranship to the abandoned port of discharge is consistent with the rights of the owners. On the evidence, the respondents' right or power to tranship was terminated on 11 May 1979 when the Kota Agung was still loading the remainder of the goods. Further, none of the acts leading to and including the transhipment of the goods were forced upon the appellants by any circumstance. The transhipment was entirely voluntary.
(f) The appellants intended to deny the respondents' right (to prohibit transhipment) and also at the same time asserted a right (to tranship) inconsistent with the respondents' right to prohibit it. Not only that, the evidence shows that the appellants in transhipping the goods intended to charge freight and to claim a lien on the goods for freight. This was clearly an intention to assert dominion over the goods until it was delivered to the respondents. The transhipment was sufficient to constitute conversion.
(g) On the evidence, the appellants had no right to retain possession of the goods on board the Kota Agung. Their wrongful possession constituted trespass to the goods. The goods were lost whilst they were still in unlawful possession. The appellants' position was that of insurers and in the event that happened, the appellants were liable for the loss of the goods, whether or not they were negligent.
(h) The law on bailment is well established. The onus is on the appellants to establish that the goods were lost without their negligence. The master was negligent or in breach of duty in not closing the hatches during the lunch break or leaving it open for a long period of time. In any case, the appellants failed to discharge the onus of proving the probable cause of the fire and, has not discharged the onus of proving that their servants were not negligent in allowing the fire to occur in the circumstances it did.
(i) The appellants' duty was to keep the goods in the warehouse at Porbander until the respondents took possession of it. In insisting on keeping the goods on board the ship and delivering the goods at Khorramshahr, the appellants did so at their own risk and became insurers of the goods.
(j) Section 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act has no application in the present case where the cargo is carried on board a ship without the cargo owner's consent. The section has no application except where the goods are lawfully taken in or put on board a Singapore ship.
The Grounds of the Appeal
The appellants in their petition of appeal say that the learned trial judge erred in fact, law and principle in holding that:
(a) the appellants were not entitled under the provision of the bills of lading nor obliged to under the Indian Law and Regulations and prevailing circumstances to tranship the said cargo to Khorramshahr on the vessel ""KOTA AGUNG"" from Porbandar;
(b) the appellants were liable to the respondent for conversion, wrongful detention, and trespass or any of those grounds;
(c) the appellants were negligent or in breach of their duty to carefully stow and carry the cargo;
(d) the appellants were not entitled to rely on s. 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act.
The respondents say that at the appeal they will contend that the decision of the learned trial judge given on the 10 August 1990 ought to be affirmed on the grounds relied upon in the trial and also on the additional following grounds:
(a) That the true interpretation and construction of cl. 5 of the bill of lading in relation to the telex correspondence between the appellants and the respondents is that contended for by the respondents in their submissions.
(b) That the finding made by the learned trial judge that the respondents had not instructed the appellants not to remove the goods from Porbandar was against the true weight of the evidence.
(c) The appellants have not discharged the onus of proof that the loss occurred without their actual fault or privity in all the circumstances.
Conclusion
I do not consider the issues which I have set out above to be of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require the services of Mr. Thomas. The case was argued before the learned trial judge by G P. Selvam (as he then was) and Miss Anjali Iyer on behalf of the appellants and by H. C. Hiew and Nicholas Woo on behalf of the respondents. The parties and their solicitors were clearly of the view that the questions of fact and law which arose at the trial were not of sufficient difficulty and complexity to require the appearance of Queen's Counsel. Even if the appeal raises complex issues of law, there is no reason to believe that local counsel would not be able to address the Court of Appeal adequately. It is the practice of the Court of Appeal to request counsel for the parties to an appeal to file written submissions. If the parties to the appeal feel that they should have the best legal advice available, they can consult Queen's Counsel and their local counsel can adopt the opinions from Queen's Counsel as part of their written submissions which will be filed with the Court of Appeal. In this age of modern technology, Queen's Counsel can easily reached by means of the facsimile or telex machine.",1992-06-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
The Claim
The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendants for breach of a contract for the sale of sawn timber. The contract was made in Singapore between the plaintiff and the defendants. Both Singapore parties. The shipment was to be effected at Belawan Deli, Indonesia. Payment was by irrevocable letter of credit. The defendants established a letter of credit but it lapsed before any shipment was made. The plaintiff requested an extension of the credit. The defendants refused but promised that they would pay after delivery if the plaintiff would ship the goods which were then ready for loading. The plaintiff relied on the defendants' promise and shipped 58 tons of sawn timber valued at S$27,089.65. The defendants refused to pay the price on the ground that the plaintiff was in breach of the contract. It was further alleged that the plaintiff was in breach of another contract they had with the defendants. The defendants counter-claimed damages for breach of contract and asserted a set-off.
 
The counterclaim
By the contract which was the subject matter of the counterclaim the plaintiff had agreed to sell and the defendants agreed to purchase 606 tons of sawn timber. Payment was to be by letter of credit. It was asserted that the plaintiff in breach of the contract failed to deliver any timber. The plaintiff delivered a reply and a defence to the counterclaim alleging that the defendants had failed to establish a letter of credit as stipulated in the contract. It was contended that the plaintiff, therefore, was discharged from his obligation to ship any timber.
On summons for directions it was ordered that affidavits of the evidence in chief of all witnesses be limited to one affidavit by each witness to be filed and exchanged within six months. It was also ordered that the evidence in chief or the substance thereof of all expert witnesses should be in the form of affidavit and should be exchanged/disclosed within six months.
The six months period expired but the defendants failed to deliver any affidavit evidence of an expert.
 
Objection to evidence
When the case came on for trial the defendants consented to judgment being entered against them for $23,512.06 and costs. That left the counterclaim to be tried. In respect of the counterclaim the defendants tendered an affidavit by a Malaysian lawyer, Mr Dennis George Frost, as an expert. His credentials were: He was an advocate and solicitor in the High Court of Malaya. He had been actively engaged in the timber export trade of Malaysia and Singapore from 1954 until 1990 either as an exporter or as consultant and legal adviser to the trade. He was a founder member of the Timber Exporters Association of Malaysia (formerly known as Federation of Malaya Timber Exporters Association) and had served as Vice President and Committee Member from 1957 until 1979 and as part-time executive director from 1979 to 1990. During the above period he had served as member of the Malaysian Timber Board (a ministerial appointment) for approximately seven years representing the Timber Exporters Association of Malaysia. Finally, he had been recently appointed to the panel of lawyers of the Malaysian Timber Industry Board. The evidence which he proposed to give was as follows:
In the timber export trade, there has always been flexibility in respect of supplies of timber as well as payments therefor by the very nature of the trade. Even in the case of contractual payment conditions calling for payment by letter of credit, such flexibility has prevailed appertaining to contracts not specifically giving a time limit for the establishing of such letters of credit. It is quite normal in the timber trade for flexibility to be given to the time for establishment of letters of credit, with letters of credit being established after the supplier of the timber has given some intimation to the buyers as to approximately when the goods are anticipated to be delivered by him. Therefore, unless the contract specifically stipulates a time limit for establishing a letter of credit, the establishment of a letter of credit immediately upon entering into a contract for the sale of timber is not regarded as a condition precedent of the contract, provided that the letter of credit is established shortly after intimation by the supplier that the goods would be supplied in the near future or are in the course of manufacture.
The plaintiff objected to the evidence to being given either in the form of an affidavit or as oral evidence. The objection was based on delay in delivering the affidavit. It was claimed that the plaintiff was prejudiced in his preparation to meet the proposed evidence.
In order to determine whether what was sought to be adduced as evidence was admissible counsel was asked to state the facts which were sought to be established by the evidence. Counsel was also asked to state whether it was foreign law that the plaintiff was seeking to prove as fact. Counsel's response was that it was evidence of the law which governed the rights of the parties. Counsel for the defendants, however, conceded that all questions of law must be decided on the basis of authorities and reason and not by evidence of witnesses.
Apart from delay there were two other objections to the evidence being tendered. First, the matters relied on were not pleaded at all. The defendants were precluded from adducing evidence on the matter not pleaded.
 
Letter of credit - condition precedent
It has long been established that except when the parties have agreed otherwise, where a contract for sale of goods provides for payment by a banker's letter of credit, the establishing of credit is a condition precedent to the seller making the goods ready for delivery. And the credit must be made available for the whole shipment period.
Pavia & Co., S.P.A. v Thurmann-Nielsen < 1952 > 2 QB 84 concerned a contract for the sale of three thousand metric tons of Brazilian groundnuts. It provided for shipment from Brazil to Genoa as to the first fifteen hundred tons in February, March, or April, 1949. As to the second fifteen hundred tons shipment was to be in March, April or May at the sellers' option. Payment was to be by confirmed credit utilisable by sellers on delivery of certain documents. The question arose as to when the credit had to be established. The buyers submitted that they were under no obligation to open the credit until the sellers were ready to tender the documents or took steps to ship the goods.
On the other hand on behalf of the sellers it was contended that the buyers' obligation under this contract was to make the credit available to the sellers, if they reasonably can, so that the sellers had the whole of the shipping period prescribed by the contract available to them. McNair J held against the buyers said:
The contract simply will not work if the buyers are under no obligation to put up a credit until they know that the sellers are ready to ship. Confirmed credit is a devise, as I see it, intended primarily for the sellers' benefit. Unless the buyer is under the obligation of opening this credit and causing it to be confirmed at an early date, the sellers for whose protection the credit is opened may be deprived of part of their legitimate period of shipment.
The buyers appealed to the court of appeal which affirmed the decision of McNair J. Somervell LJ said:
The contract would be unworkable if the buyer was under no obligation until a date, which he could not possibly know, and which there is no machinery for his finding out, namely, when the seller actually has the goods down at the port ready to be put on the ship. There are no words in the contract which would justify us in arriving at that result and there is no reason why we should imply any such term into this contract. I do not think it is a question of implication. I think when a seller is given a right to ship over a period and there is machinery for payment, that machinery must be available over the whole of that period. If the buyer is anxious, as he might be if the period of shipment is a long one, not to have to put the credit machinery in motion until shortly before the seller is likely to want to ship, then he must put in some provision by which the credit shall be provided 14 days after a cable received from the seller, or the like.
Denning LJ in his judgment said:
The sale of goods across the world is now usually arranged by means of confirmed credits. The buyer requests his banker to open a credit in favour of the seller, and in pursuance of that request the banker, or his foreign agent, issues a confirmed credit in favour of the seller. This credit is a promise by the banker to pay money to the seller in return for the shipping documents. Then the seller, when he presents the documents, gets paid the contract price. The conditions of the credit must be strictly fulfilled, otherwise the seller would not be entitled to draw on it.
The question in this case is this: In a contract which provides for payment by confirmed credit, when must the buyer open the credit? In the absence of express stipulation, I think the credit must be made available to the seller at the beginning of the shipment period. The reason is because the seller is entitled, before he ships the goods, to be assured that, on shipment, he will get paid. The seller is not bound to tell the buyer the precise date when he is going to ship; and whenever he does ship the goods, he must be able to draw on the credit. He may ship on the very first day of the shipment period. If, therefore, the buyer is to fulfil his obligations he must make the credit available to the seller at the very first date when the goods may be lawfully shipped in compliance with the contract.
The Pavia concerned a c.i.f. contract. Diplock J in Ian Stach Ltd v Baker Bosley Ltd < 1958 > 2 QB 130 held that even in the case of a f.o.b. contract the credit must be established.
In Plasticmoda Societa per Azioni v Davidson (Manchester) Ltd < 1952 > 1 Lloyds Rep 538 Denning LJ said:
It is settled by the case of Pavia & Co S.P.A. v Thurmann-Nielsen, that, when nothing is said, the buyer must establish the credit at the beginning of the shipment period. There was in this case no shipment period, but only a shipment date, a specified date for shipment, originally Mar. 9, 1950, varied subsequently to May 15, 1950. The letter of credit ought, no doubt, to have been established a reasonable time before that date. That was a condition precedent to the obligation of the seller to ship the goods, and that condition precedent was not fulfilled.
Later in Sinason-Teicher Inter-American Grain Corporation v Oilcakes and Oilseeds Trading Co Ltd < 1954 > 1 WLR at 1400 Denning LJ put the following gloss on the Pavia case:
The Pavia case does not decide that the buyer can delay right up to the first date for shipment. It only decides that he must provide the letter of credit at least by that date. The correct view is that, if nothing is said about time in the contract, the buyer must provide the letter of credit within a reasonable time before the first date for shipment.
The true position in my view is that if the shipment period is long the buyer must establish the credit to be available on the first date of shipment. On the other hand if the period is short the buyer must establish it within a reasonable time before the first date of shipment to afford ample time to the seller to procure or prepare the goods for shipment.
The purpose of the rule is to facilitate trade by giving certainty in favour of the seller before he procures the goods. The seller may also use the credit to establish a back to back credit in favour of his supplier. The buyer however has no right to demand proof of readiness of goods before establishing the credit. The seller if he wants to inspect the goods first should make a stipulation to that effect in the contract. If the buyer is in breach of the documentary credit clause such breach will discharge the seller from his obligations under the contract. Further the buyer will be liable to the seller in damages if they can be proved. The proposition made by Mr Dennis Frost is a complete anathema to principles which are well established and have been acted upon for the last 50 years. There is no reason to depart from them.
In this case the defendants agreed to establish a credit. The contract did not stipulate some other obligation. He failed to establish the credit - a condition precedent to the plaintiff's obligation to prepare the goods. The defendants' counterclaim accordingly had no legal basis or merit. I therefore held that the proposed evidence of Mr Dennis Frost was not admissible. Thereupon the defendants withdrew the counterclaim and agreed to pay the costs of the counterclaim to the plaintiff.",1992-12-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
This is an appeal against an order made by me allowing an amendment by the defendant to certain paragraphs of its counterclaim. As these grounds are delivered contemporaneously with my judgment in the main case, I will not set out the whole background to the application to amend, as this is sufficiently described in my judgment (see section 7). These grounds should therefore be read together with my judgment.
The proposed amendments sought to plead that the contract had been properly terminated pursuant to cl 35 of the Specification or alternatively at common law, either by the defendant's letter to the plaintiff of 28 May 1982, or by one or other of the letters written or acts done by the defendant after 28 May 1982. I considered all the arguments advanced by the plaintiff's counsel, particularly the argument that such amendments might be construed as allowing a new cause of action after it had been time-barred. However, it seemed to me that the amendments, to the extent that they relied on the letter of 28 May as a common law termination, should be allowed for the following reasons.
(1) The cause of action was damages for breach of contract, and the proposed amendments made no change to that cause of action; accordingly, the provisions of o 20 r 5(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1970 did not apply (see Robinson v Unicos Property Corporation Ltd < 1962 > 1 WLR 520 at 525-526).
(2) In any event, even if this were to be regarded as a new cause of action, it would be well within the terms of o 20 r 5(5).
(3) It was plainly just under o 20 r 5(2) that the amendments should be allowed since:
(a) I was only asked to rule on an alternative interpretation of the very letter whose validity was being challenged; and
(b) the alternative interpretation was, for the reasons given in my judgment, already in issue by way of defence on the existing pleadings, and it would be absurd if it were not allowed to be considered by way of counterclaim.
(4) For the reasons given in section 7 of my judgment, it seemed to me that the alternative interpretation canvassed for the letter of 28 May 1982 was a valid one in the light of the events and letters leading up to that date. It was a defence that was reasonably plain from the documents in the agreed bundle, and was one which could be raised on the evidence already led. In short, it was a latent defence waiting to be discovered.
(5) I did not consider that any further discovery would be necessary, as there should not have been any documents relevant to the letter of 28 May 1982 which had not already been disclosed under the previous orders for discovery. There would also not be any need for further evidence, since the alternative interpretation of the letter of 28 May 1982 would be purely a matter of construction, and no question of the writer's subjective intention would need to be considered (see Chitty on Contracts (26th Ed, 1989) Vol I para 1711). In any event, no application was made by either party to recall witnesses as a consequence of the amendment.
I accordingly allowed the amendments to that extent. Although the considerations I have set out above would also have applied to some of the other proposed amendments, given the late stage of the application, I did not wish not to allow any amendments beyond what was absolutely necessary in the interests of justice.

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was dissolved in 1982. The petitioner (whom I will call ""the applicant"") was awarded custody of the only child of the marriage with reasonable access to the respondent. In the decree nisi, the respondent was ordered to pay a reasonable sum by way of maintenance to the applicant and the child of the marriage. I do not know what maintenance was paid immediately after the divorce although, from the petition and the statement as to arrangements for children, I understood that the child was receiving $2,000 a month at the time of the divorce, and that the respondent had agreed to continue paying this amount as well as a nominal sum of $1 per month for the applicant.
Since 1986, the respondent has been paying maintenance for the child of $500 a month plus another $100 a month for the child's Spanish lessons. In May and June this year, the respondent deducted the extra $100 from his monthly maintenance payments. The applicant then filed an application for an order that the respondent pay maintenance of $2,000 a month for the child. After reading the affidavits filed by both parties and hearing arguments, I ordered that :
(a) the respondent pay the applicant $1,650 per month (which I will call ""the maintenance sum"") as maintenance for the child with effect from 1 July 1992 as well as a further $60 per month directly to the child as pocket money;
(b) the maintenance sum be reduced by $500 in June and December each year;
(c) the respondent be at liberty to apply if he wished to make certain payments out of the maintenance sum through his solicitors;
(d) payment of the maintenance sum be made on the first day of each month directly to the petitioner's Post Office Savings Bank account; and
(e) the respondent pay the petitioner's court disbursements but otherwise there be no order as to costs.
The respondent now appeals against these orders.
In the first place, the respondent incorrectly described the terms of my order in his notice of appeal by stating that I ordered :
(i) he pay the applicant $900 per month with effect from 1 July 1992 for maintenance of the child of the marriage;
(ii) he pay the applicant for the monthly expenses of the tuition and extra-curricular activities of the child upon tender by the applicant of proper invoices/receipts for these expenses and provided that the sum payable by the respondent should not exceed $750.
The orders made by me were as I have set them out earlier in these grounds of judgment. In the course of delivering my orders, I indicated to the applicant and counsel for the respondent roughly how I had arrived at my figure of $1,650, but nonetheless the amount awarded was a global sum. I also indicated that, if the respondent was concerned that the sums paid by him as maintenance for the child would be misused by the applicant, he could apply for an order directing that certain payments be made through his solicitors directly to those persons or bodies providing tuition or activities for the child, but I made no order to that effect at the hearing.
Applicant's background
The applicant lives in Singapore with her present husband and the child. Since 1987 her financial position had deteriorated. She was a practising advocate and solicitor but gave up practice to go into business. Her affidavits disclosed personal liabilities of about $217,200. She owned no real property, and had a credit balance of only $3,000 in her Central Provident Fund account. Of her personal liabilities, $135,000 was owed to financial institutions, $27,000 to the Central Provident Fund Board (which I discounted, since it was not her debt but the debt of her company) and $55,200 by way of personal loans. She had an assured personal income of $5,000 a month, of which $4,500 was expended on repayments of loans from financial institutions and friends. Her present husband is an artist of uncertain income.
Respondent's background
The respondent, formerly a practising advocate and solicitor in Singapore, is now a businessman living in Kuala Lumpur. His last income tax return filed with the Malaysian Income Tax Authorities declared an annual income of M$100,000. He appeared to be living in reasonably affluent circumstances, occupying a bungalow in Kuala Lumpur (which was leased by his company) and having the use of a beachside bungalow in Malacca (which was owned by his company, of which he was a director and 49% shareholder). On the regular access visits of his child to him in Kuala Lumpur, the respondent consistently paid for his child to fly first-class. According to the respondent, his net salary after tax in 1991 was M$85,000 (S$53,550) giving him an average monthly income of S$4,462. He also claimed to have monthly expenses of $4,400, including an amount of S$500 a month paid to his mother.
Child's expenses
The child is ten years old and appears to be highly intelligent. He was tested as gifted and is in the gifted education programme at Anglo-Chinese Junior School. He is conversant in three languages and has a basic knowledge of two more. The applicant claimed that the child's monthly expenses were as follows :

The applicant also claimed transport expenses on the following basis :
""We live in Katong and the activities are in Serangoon Road, Paterson Road, Siglap etc. In addition when the child has something on at school he does not come home on the school bus but has to be fetched at 3 p.m. or 6 p.m. All these have to be accompanied by an adult for now whilst he is young and a little absent minded on the road.
Costs vary from $6.40 to $17.00 per trip and some days two trips are necessary and some days none at all.

Respondent's position
The respondent's position on the statement of expenses was as follows.
(a) He was paying pocket money of $60 per month directly to the child, so the sum of $26 claimed by the applicant under ""School"" was unnecessary.
(b) He thought that Spanish lessons ($200) were unnecessary and were an extravagance. Tamil tuition ($150) was unnecessary because he could give tuition in Tamil, which was not a school subject in any event. He initially objected to the need for Chinese tuition, but his counsel later agreed to this item. He also challenged the necessity of the other extra curricular activities but later agreed (through his counsel) to pay for them on presentation of invoices.
(c) He did not think that the two movies and outings ($90) were necessary, since he would be taking the child out to movies and outings when the child was with him.
(d) He did not agree to the cost of books and learning materials ($100) as the child should be able to make use of public and school libraries.
(e) He thought the claim for transport was grossly excessive and inflated. His counsel argued that the child should travel by bus.
(f) He did not think he should be responsible for the applicant's lifestyle if it was beyond her present means. The applicant's alleged household expenses were not documented and she should seek cheaper accommodation.
(g) He contended that account should be taken of the fact that the child would spend two weekends in every month and half of the June school holidays with him (during which time the cost of maintaining the child in Singapore would be reduced).
(h) He argued that it was not his fault that the applicant's financial position was precarious, and challenged her right to seek increased maintenance for the child as her financial situation changed. He also challenged her personal loans as there were no documents evidencing them.
(i) He was also providing food parcels for the child and purchased clothes, shoes, toys, books and other items for him.
My approach
My general approach to this application was as follows.
(1) I was mindful of s 122(3) of the Women's Charter (Ch 353), which in effect imposes on a mother an obligation to contribute to her child's maintenance having regard to her means. Those means, however, must be determined partly objectively and partly subjectively; the ability to contribute must be determined both with regard to the mother's earning capability as well as her actual financial circumstances. As Disbery J said in Schartner v Schartner (1970) 10 DLR (3d) 61 at 67 : ""Means"" refers to the pecuniary resources of the person which, in my opinion, also includes his or her potential earning capacity.
In this case, it did not matter why the applicant had fallen into financial difficulties. The question was what amount she was in fact able to provide by way of maintenance for the child, and I was satisfied, having read her affidavits, that her financial position was as bad as she described it. It was not easy for a former member of the bar to admit in her affidavit (as well as personally at the hearing) that she was facing bankruptcy, and I had no reason to disbelieve her, particularly in the absence of rebutting evidence. There was no allegation that she had deliberately dissipated her assets or incurred debts in order to avoid, or without regard to, her financial obligations as a parent. I therefore had to regard her case as one of genuine business failure. She had an earning capability, but that capability (at least for the immediate future) would have to be employed in the service of her creditors until her debts could be repaid.
(2) The essential question to me was to fix an amount of maintenance for the child which was reasonable in the circumstances of this case. Given the child's middle class background and his exceptional intelligence, he appeared to have a promising future, and it seemed a pity if full opportunity was not taken to develop his talents to the full.
(3) The fact that the respondent purchased certain necessities and luxuries for the child was commendable, but did not detract from the basic question of what was needed from him in order to sustain the child's regular and reasonable needs. I accepted the applicant's contention that the respondent's purchases could only be regarded as supplemental to the child's needs.
(4) I was not prepared to accept the respondent's statement of income and expenditure as conclusive of his financial ability to pay. He made no disclosure of his assets (apart from stating that he held 49% of the shares in his company) or of his non-Malaysian income. On his statement of income and expenditure, he would have a net surplus of $62 a month. However, he admitted that, over and above the $500 he was paying as maintenance, he was giving his son $60 a month pocket money, which would then leave him with a net surplus of $2 per month. Before May this year, he had also been paying another $100 a month for Spanish lessons, which would then make his expenditure greater than his income. In addition to this, there must be factored in the cost of the first-class air fares and the various purchases which he said he made for his child. Furthermore, although he earlier contended that $500 was more than adequate maintenance for his child, at the hearing before me he conceded through his counsel that an amount of $1,177 (plus another $60 for pocket money) was appropriate. His allowance of $500 a month to his mother (not being a legal obligation) would also have to be reduced or eliminated if he could not satisfy the claims of his son, which took precedence. In Lee Puay Hwa v Tay Cheow Seng < 1991 > 3 MLJ 1, the Court of Appeal said (per Yong Pung How CJ at p 2) :
Full and frank disclosure is important ... and in its absence the court is entitled to draw inferences adverse to the husband as to his capacity or faculties and to treat him as a man in a position to command a very substantial income ...
I was therefore not inclined to accept his statement that he was not able to pay maintenance of $2,000 a month.
Analysis of expenses
Against that background, I then examined the applicant's claim for expenses. My conclusions were as follows :
(a) School expenses I thought these were reasonable and considered that an amount of $125 should be allocated for this. On reflection, I now feel that I should have deducted the item of $26 for pocket money in view of the respondent's direct payment of $60, but I do not think this made any difference to the end result as I felt that $1,650 was reasonable as a global sum.
(b) Tuition and extra-mural activities I agreed that Spanish lessons and pets and hobbies were perhaps luxuries in the circumstances. The other activities were either essential or highly desirable for a gifted child. Few children are given the opportunity of being exposed to more than one ethnic culture, and I felt that the applicant's enthusiasm for immersing the child in Chinese, English and Tamil lessons as well as enrichment activities in physical and cultural areas were likely, if persevered with, to develop the child into a role model for Singaporeans. There was no evidence that the respondent was qualified to provide Tamil tuition and I did not think any deduction should be made for this item. I was therefore prepared to allocate a sum of $750 under this head.
(c) Entertainment and family activities Given the applicant's financial circumstances, I thought these should be curtailed, but, nevertheless, some allocation should be made. I found the respondent's attitude somewhat ungenerous, as it is important to a child's development to have family outings with both his parents. I therefore allocated a sum of $75 for this head.
(d) Personal I thought that, in the circumstances, there should be no allowance for anything other than food (clothing and shoes being taken care of under the allocation for uniform, shoes and clothes) and allocated a sum of $300 for this head.
(e) Transport Given that the child had to attend extra-curricular activities in different parts of the island, and the fact that his mother and stepfather could not conveniently transport him themselves, I thought some allowance for taxi fares should be made, as the evidence was that the child (who is only ten years old) was ""a little absent minded on the road"". The applicant should, however, take steps to teach the child to travel alone by bus in the next couple of years, since he needs to travel often, and the respondent may well, when the quantum of maintenance is next reviewed by the Court, propose that any allowance based on transport should be reduced. For the moment, however, I considered that an allocation of $150 would be reasonable, since the respondent could easily pay for this by buying economy- class air tickets for his son to travel to and from Kuala Lumpur instead of paying for first-class fares.
(f) Household The applicant was claiming a fractional contribution for her household expenses. This was justified because the financial needs of a child encompass not only the direct, but also the indirect, cost of providing for the child's material needs, including housing. However, I thought that the respondent's contribution should be kept relatively low, reflecting the applicant's duty to contribute a reasonable share of these expenses. In the circumstances, I allocated a relatively arbitrary figure of $250.
Global analysis
All of these allocations were notional, and were not expressed in my order. The sum total of the various notional allowances was $1,650 a month. I then considered this sum as a global figure and tested it against the various factors set out in s 123 of the Women's Charter. Having regard to the words of the section and the facts of this case, I considered that $1,650 was indeed a reasonable monthly sum to ask the respondent to pay for the child's maintenance. In arriving at this figure, I took into account the necessity for the applicant to make some contribution to the child's maintenance. Her statement of total monthly expenses for the child amounted to $2,399. Even if I gave a generous discount to that statement, I still believed that the actual cost of maintaining this child would not be far short of $2,000. I therefore made the order for maintenance on the basis that the total cost of maintenance was to be shared between the applicant and the respondent, although in unequal proportions, in view of the applicant's present financial circumstances.
I deducted a relatively arbitrary amount of $500 per month from the maintenance sum for the two months in the year during which the child would be spending half the month with the respondent. Obviously I could not reduce the maintenance sum by half for these months, since most of his expenses would still have to be incurred during his absence from Singapore.
Costs
Finally, I come to the respondent's appeal against my order that he pays the applicant's disbursement costs. I awarded no profit costs, as the applicant appeared in person. The respondent had been paying $500 to $600 a month for maintenance. He initially contended that $500 was an adequate sum but was prepared, at the hearing, to offer $1,177 plus $60. Since the applicant had to incur expenses to compel the respondent to increase his maintenance contribution, I saw no reason why he should not pay the applicant's out-of-pocket expenses for this application.",1992-10-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

JUDGMENT:
 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
As the Plaintiffs have filed a Respondents' Notice appealing against my decision on the quantum of damages which I awarded to the First Plaintiff pursuant to the Defendant's Notice of Appeal, I now give my reasons for the amount of damages which I awarded to the First Plaintiff, in particular for loss of future earnings, in addition to my grounds ofjudgement touching on liability dated 11 October 1991.
The Plaintiffs are dissatisfied with the sum of $72,000 awarded to the First Plaintiff based on a multiplicand of $400 per month.
At the material time the First Plaintiff was in the Secondary 4 class in the Methodist Girls' School and about to take her 'O' level finals. According to her principal Mrs Anna Tham (PW6) the First Plaintiff was very active in sports; she was a school squash player and a member of the netball as well as track and field teams. Academically however she was an average student. Her school report book (exh D1) showed that whilst the First Plaintiff did pass her examinations every year and she was promoted, her results were very average. Although under cross examination DW6 disagreed that she was somewhat biased in the First Plaintiff's favour in her appraisal of the latter's future, I found on the evidence that I could not share her confidence that the First Plaintiff would in all probability have gained entry into a junior college and thereafter gone onto either the Institute of Education or the university and qualified as a teacher.
Based on the First Plaintiff's academic record, I could not accept PW6's evidence that with the ceasing of all training before the preliminary examinations and with a last minute spurt, the First Plaintiff would have done better at the preliminary examinations than in her previous examinations and, but for the accident, she would have eventually entered the teaching profession. At best the First Plaintiff in my view would have completed her 'A' levels education, qualified as a secretary or assumed such other similar post. Granted that she was in the express stream of her school and that she had moved from a lower rank class to a middle rank class at one time. That however did not mean that she would proceed to tertiary education for a certainty, given the intense competition to gain entry into the local universities.
Consequently, I rejected the figure of $1,600 put forward by the Plaintiffs' Counsel as the First Plaintiff's monthly loss of future earnings and the multiplier of 18+ years. In place thereof I substituted a multiplicand of $400 and a multiplier of 15 years with a consequential reduction from $355,200 to $72,000 as the First Plaintiff's total loss of future earnings. Counsel for the Defendant had proposed the range $350-$500 as the multiplicand due to the lack of evidence in particular from her father the Second Plaintiff (PW4) as to his future plans for the First Plaintiff or as to her own plans.
I was of the view that the sum of $1,600 put forward by her Counsel was excessive as it was based on the estimated salary of a young professional or executive on which there was no evidence before the court. As Lord Goddard said in the case of < Bonham-Carter v Hyde Park Hotel Ltd > (1948) 64 T.L.R. 177:-
Plaintiffs must understand that if they bring actions for damages it is for them to prove their damage; it is not enough to write down the particulars, and, so to speak, throw them at the head of the Court, saying: ""This is what I have lost; I ask you to give me these damages."" They have to prove it.
I had already expressed my doubts that the First Plaintiff would have joined the teaching let alone other professions. Even if she did qualify as a teacher, I was of the view that $400 would be the appropriate multiplicand for a teacher qualified to teach physical education and or who held a general degree. The same multiplicand was also appropriate in the event the First Plaintiff became a secretary at say a starting salary of between $800-$900 after obtaining shorthand and other secretarial qualifications or joined a bank or took on some other office position. Taking into account her background, living and other expenses, tax considerations, discounting for the fact that the award would be a lump sum payment and for other contingencies, I felt that $400 would be the First Plaintiff's average net loss of income regardless of whether she ended up teaching or working in an office. Taking a multiplier of 15 years (on which the Plaintiffs are not appealing), I arrived at the figure of $72,000 as the First Plaintiff's total loss of earnings.
As part of her claim for general damages, the First Plaintiff claimed the sum of $62,160 for loss of future employer's Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions calculated at 17+%. I rejected this item of claim as I agreed with Counsel for the Defendant that the CPF element cannot be calculated separately. In the First Plaintiff's case, it must be remembered that she had yet to join the labour force and it would be too speculative to compute her loss of CPF contributions when evidence of her future career is itself inconclusive. The authorities cited by Counsel for the First Plaintiff in support of this head of claim concerned plaintiffs who were actually working and whose loss of earnings as well as employer's CPF contributions could be calculated with certainty. Accordingly I did not think they were relevant.",1992-01-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

Judgment:
 
 
The facts which the parties displayed before the court fall within a narrow compass. The third defendant, a property broker, was the prime mover of the events that brought the parties before the court. Property speculation in Singapore was his sideline. He persuaded his brother, (the second defendant) and the first defendant to purchase two units of office space in the building known as Orchard Towers (""the property"") in Singapore. The purchase price for both units was S$854,900. As in most speculative ventures, it was not the defendants' intention to make an outright payment but apply leverage finance. This brought the plaintiffs into the picture. They agreed to advance $700,000 on the security of the property and a personal guarantee of the third defendant. The third defendant negotiated the loan with the plaintiffs. Eventually the plaintiffs and the defendants retained solicitors to act for them in the preparation and execution of the loan documents.
In the documents their address was given as Suite 11A2, 11th Floor, Yen San Building, 258 Orchard Road, Singapore, which was the office address of the third defendant. Subsequently, the market did not move the way the defendants expected. There was default in the payment of instalments. It became a buyer's market. The property was realised by the plaintiffs by forced sale. There was still a substantial amount due and payable to the plaintiffs. Hence this action.
The Defence
All three defendants refused to pay and raised an unmeritorious but not unfamiliar defence. It was said that the second defendant was at all material times a Malaysian resident in Malaysia. He failed to obtain permission to take the loan. By that fact, it was argued the loan made by the plaintiffs was made illegal by the Exchange Control Act, 1953 of Malaysia and a directive issued by Malaysian authorities. Secondly the loan was illegal under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) of Singapore. It was submitted that a judgment for the plaintiffs would be contrary to public policy of Singapore and it would jeopardise the friendly foreign relations between Singapore and Malaysia.
The court must be alive to what the implications would be if the defendants' contentions are right. They could be raised in hundreds of transactions in which foreigners raise loans in Singapore. It will encourage unscrupulous borrowers to raise that as a stalk defence. Bankers and others interested in commerce will find it necessary to investigate the intricacies of foreign law before they transact any business with foreigners, or purchase from or sell goods to a foreign country. This is not conducive to fair dealing in business. The defence requires careful consideration.
Illegality Point No.1 (Foreign Exchange Control Law)
An analysis of the authorities on the matter leads to the conclusion that the defence of illegality on the facts of this case has no place in the scheme of things under our law. In 1987 well after this action was set down for trial A P Rajah J in Four Seas Communication Bank v Sim See Kee < 1990 > 3 MLJ 226 rejected the points of defence taken as in this case. In that case the plaintiffs a bank incorporated in Singapore gave overdraft facilities to the defendant a Malaysian. The overdraft account was operated in Singapore dollars in Singapore. Summary judgment was obtained by the plaintiffs against the defendant for moneys advanced and credit facilities extended. The defendant appealed against the summary judgment given by the Registrar on the ground that the loan was not enforceable due to (i) a breach of s 4 of the Exchange Control Act 1953 of Malaysia and (ii) a breach of Article VIII s 2(b) of the Bretton Woods Agreement Order 1966 read with Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) of Singapore. A P Rajah J in dismissing the defendant's appeal held that based on the facts the proper law of the contract was that of Singapore. He applied the statement of the law in Paragraph 5 of Encyclopaedia of Banking Law Vo1 2 1124 against the defendants :
It should further be noted that if the contract is lawful by the proper law and lawful at the place of performance, then it is immaterial that the party liable to perform would by doing so violate the laws of the foreign country in which he is resident or carries on business or of which he is a national. The result is that a borrower or lender could be committed to perform a contract even though performance of the contract violated the laws of the country of its incorporation, eg an exchange control law, provided that there is an external proper law and the illegality does not arise where payments have to be made.
It was submitted by the defendants in this case that the decision of A P Rajah J did not bind me and the decision of House of Lords in Regazzoni v Sethia < 1958 > AC 301 was not considered by the learned Judge.
True, the decision of A P Rajah J is not binding on me but the decision reflects the true law and reason. Further his decision was not discordant with Regazzoni v Sethia. Let us look at the concepts.
When courts are asked not to enforce an agreement because the performance on the dependence of the common law doctrine of illegality as distinct from statutory law, a line of demarcation must be drawn between lex fori and foreign law. In the former case everyone before the tribunal is deemed to know the lex fori for ignorance of the law is no excuse. Foreign law however is fact and ignorance of fact is excusable. Ignorati facti excusat, ignonantia juris no excusat. Because foreign law is fact it must be pleaded and proved but not the lex fori.
Thus in Miller v Karlinski (1945) 62 TLR 85 the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an employment contract which involved a fraud on the revenue. The parties were ignorant of the illegal nature of the transaction. The court of appeal held that where parties enter into arrangements which would be lawful the courts would not entertain an action to enforce them even if the parties are ignorant of the illegality. In an earlier case, Waugh v Morris (1873) LR 8 QB 202, Blackburn J said : ""where a contract is to do a thing which cannot be peformed without violation of law, it is void, whether the parties knew the law or not."" The law in these cases was the lex fori.
Contrast that with Fielding & Platt Ltd v Najjar < 1969 > 1 WLR 357. The defendant in that case, a Lebanese citizen, had a special fondness for false invoices. He ordered goods from an English manufacturer. He wanted the English manufacturing company to render an invoice for half the cost, instead of the whole: so as to save customs duties. He asked the English company to write a false letter (which he drafted) to delude the Lebanese customs authorities. The English company refused. When the English company sued the defendant in England for price of goods the defendant raised the defence that the contract was tainted with illegality under Lebanese law. The defence failed because the suggested illegality originated with the defendant and there was no evidence that the English company was knowingly a party to any illegality. In the earlier case of Foster v Driscoll < 1929 > 1 KB 470 Sankey LJ said at 518 :
In my view the present position of the law is that the mere fact that a vendor of goods knows that the purchaser proposes to run them into a country where they are prohibited by some revenue law is not sufficient to render the contract of sale illegal, but if beyond mere knowledge the vendor actively engages in an adventure to get the goods into such country, the Court will not resist the parties to the adventure by entertaining or settling any dispute between the parties arising out of the contract.
In deciding the question of enforcement of an agreement involving breach of foreign law a two-fold test should be applied: First whether it would be unlawful under the law of the place of performance and secondly whether the person seeking the enforcement had at the time of making the contract knowledge that foreign law would be breached by performance of the contract. In Regazzoni v Sethia it was pleaded that ""the said contract, if any, was to the appellant's knowledge an illegal contract and/or was void and unenforceable in that it had for its purpose an object which was illegal and/or contrary to public policy namely, the taking and shipment of jute goods from India where the ultimate destination was the Union of South Africa, in breach of a certain Act of the Indian Parliament and Regulations made thereunder"". Sellers J in giving judgment for the defendants said < 1956 > 2 QB 490 at 504 :
In my judgment, this contract to the knowledge of both parties at the time of contracting, could not in fact have been performed without the performance in a foreign and friendly country of an act which was illegal by the law of that country, and I must hold the contract to be invalid and unenforceable.
The headnote which accurately reflects the decision of the Court of Appeal states :
While the English courts will not enforce foreign revenue or penal laws, they will not entertain an action based on a transaction which is knowingly intended to involve a breach of such laws; accordingly, the appeal must fail even if the same rules applied to political as to revenue laws and this was such a law.
The House of Lords based its decision to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal on the finding and principle that the performance of the contract would be illegal in India the place of performance of the contract and the appellant/plaintiff had knowledge of the illegality.
It was submitted for the defendants that even if the court found that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of s 4 (2) of the Exchange Control Act of Malaysia the court in order to ensure that the intention of s 4 of Malaysian Exchange Control Act was not defeated should rule in favour of the defendants. They cited Re An Arbitration Between Mahmoud and Ispahani < 1921 > 2 KB 716. In that case the Seeds, Oils and Fats Order 1919 made under the Defence of the Realm Regulations prohibited sale and purchase of linseed oil whether situated within or without the United Kingdom without a licence issued by the Food Controller to be obtained both by the buyer and the seller. The plaintiff who had a licence sold the linseed oil to the defendant in the mistaken belief that the defendant in fact had a licence. The defendant subsequently refused to accept delivery of the linseed oil on the ground that the contract was illegal as he had no licence under the order. In a claim for damages for non-acceptance of the linseed oil the English Court of Appeal held that as the defendant had no licence and the contract of sale was prohibited by the order it was illegal. As the prohibition was in the public interest no claim can be made under the contract. Scrutton LJ said:
The contract was absolutely prohibited. If an act is prohibited by statute for the public benefit, the Court must enforce the prohibition, even though the person breaking the law relies upon his own illegality.
It will be observed that the English Court of Appeal was enforcing the lex fori and accordingly it was outside the principles of Regazzoni v Sethia outlined above. There can be no doubt that had the court was enforcing foreign law the decision would have been different.
It was therefore vital that the pleadings in the case at hand declare and cogent evidence be produced to show that the performance of the contract would be illegal in Singpaore, the place of its performance, and that the plaintiffs were aware of the illegality.
In this case there was no allegation in the pleading that the performance of the loan contract was illegal by the law of Singapore. In any event even if its performance involved Malaysia it was not pleaded or proved that the plaintiff had knowledge of the Malaysian law.
A nebulous suggestion was made to the effect that an employee of the plaintiffs was aware that the first and second defendants were foreign nationals and were not resident in Singapore. The employee, according to the defendants in order to avoid the inconvenience of having to go through the foreign exchange processing suggested that the borrowers should not be disclosed to be foreign residents. Accordingly a Singapore address was recorded. This was validly refuted by the plaintiffs by their testimony. In any event the knowledge of the employee cannot be imputed to the plaintiffs. Furthermore the ground was so vague that no reliance can be placed on it. There was no question of the parties transgressing the foreign exchange laws of Singapore. Thus there was no illegality under the laws of Singapore and in any case the plaintiff had no knowledge of any illegality under Malaysian law.
Illegality Point No. 2 (Bretton Woods Agreement)
In a capsulized form the Bretton Woods Agreement point is this : The Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) is a Singapore statute. The Act read with the Bretton Woods Agreement Order 1966 gave the Bretton Woods Agreement the force of law in Singapore. The purpose of the Agreement was for Singapore to respect the currency laws of all other countries which had legislated a similar obligation on the basis of reciprocity. It is a cross-border legislation to enforce the currency laws of another country. Malaysia has a reciprocal enactment: Bretton Woods Agreement Ordinance 1957. Under the Singapore Act foreign currency laws caught by the Bretton Woods Agreement must be given the same effect as domestic laws. The principles summarised in relation to foreign laws do not apply to currency laws caught by the Bretton Woods Agreement. The difference between illegality point and Bretton Woods point is that the former depends on knowledge whereas Bretton Woods does not. Article VIII s 2 (b) of the Agreement reads as follows :
Exchange contracts which involve the currency of any member and which are contrary to the exchange control regulations of any member maintained or imposed consistently with this agreement shall be unenforceable in the territories of any member.
In Batra v Ebrahim (unreported) discussed in United City Merchants v Bank of Canada < 1982 > QB 208, CA, the plaintiff, an Indian resident in England, agreed to pay in sterling to the defendant (another Indian resident in England) in exchange for Indian rupees to be paid in India. Both England and India had signed the Bretton Woods Agreement. The English Court of Appeal held that the agreement to exchange sterling for rupees was exchange contract and unenforceable by virtue of the English Bretton Woods Agreements Act.
The term ""exchange contracts"" has received varying interpretations. In Wilson, Smithett and Cope Ltd v Terruzzi < 1976 > QB 683 Kerr J took the view that it referred to contracts for the exchange of currencies. According to F.A. Mann's The Legal Aspect of Money, 4th Ed, Nussbaum in Money in the Law, National and International suggested that it ""contemplated contracts to exchange the currency of one country for that of another as well as contracts which are monetary transactions in disguise"". Finally, in United City Merchants v Royal Bank of Canada < 1983 > AC 168 Lord Diplock with whom four other law lords agreed held that the expression ""exchange contracts"" in Article VIII s 2 (b) of the Bretton Woods Agreement is ""confined to contracts to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another; it does not include contracts entered into in connection with sale of goods which require the conversion of the buyer of one currency into another in order to enable him to pay the purchase price. The court in considering the application of the provision should look at the substance of the contracts and not at the form. It should not enforce a contract that is a mere monetary transaction in disguise.""
In Four Seas Communications Bank Ltd v Sim See Kee A P Rajah J held that loans and advances made by a bank in Singapore and in Singapore currency could not be an exchange contract because it was not a contract to exchange the currency of one country for another. The fact that the borrower was a Malaysian citizen residing in Malaysia was not pertinent to the issue of his liability to the bank.
Applying the law stated above the transaction between the plaintiffs and the defendants was not an exchange contract. Malaysian currency did not feature in the transaction at all. It was a loan connected with the purchase of land very much similar to purchase of goods mentioned by Lord Dipolock. It was not a monetary transaction.
The defences raised in this case had nothing attractive about them. The defendants stated that one of them strayed from the straight and narrow way and sought to avoid a legitimate claim. The courts should be wary of such defences. Four Seas Communications Bank Ltd v Sim See Kee is a highly satisfactory decision and I have no hesitation in applying it to this case. There will, therefore be judgment for the plaintiffs for S$311,810.73, interest at 6% from 28 August 1991 and costs in favour of the plaintiffs.

Cur Adv Vult
This is an appeal against the decision of the Deputy Registrar giving unconditional leave to the defendants to defend the plaintiffs' claim for damages for breach of contract for the sale of goods.
On 5 October 1989, the defendants agreed to sell to the plaintiffs 250 metric tons of Polypropylene, film grade, Amoco 1088, at US$760 per metric ton CIF Singapore, for shipment from an USA port to Singapore by 31 October 1989. The terms of the sale were incorporated in a Sales Order dated 5 October 1989 issued by the defendants. The mode of payment as stipulated in the Sales Order, which was signed by both parties, was ""By T.T. to our account upon presentation of Bill of lading or Delivery Order.""
On 6 November 1989, the defendants telexed the plaintiffs to inform them of the shipment of the goods from Houston, Texas on 29 November 1989 and the bill of lading number. The telex also requested the plaintiffs to arrange to remit funds to the defendants' bankers, Asia Commercial Bank, by 9 November to enable them to deliver the bills of lading to the plaintiffs.
At 11.06 on 15 November 1989, the defendants sent another telex to the plaintiffs in these terms:
We refer to the above and to our telex dated 6/11/89 and our several phone conversations. We have yet to receive funds into our account but instead we received phone call yestdy from yr Mr Syed Aljunied saying that payment will be made upon arrival of vessel in Singapore. This is contrary to our agreement. Kindly ensure funds are remitted to our account today, and pls tlx us by 2 p.m. today giving details of remittance, failing which we would be obliged to dispose the cargo due to non performance.
At 12.45 pm, the plaintiffs telexed their reply (a) that the trade practice in Singapore was that when cargo was sold CIF payment would be made one or two days before the arrival of the vessel in exchange for a delivery order, and (b) that they would pay against a delivery order if available.
At 16.20 pm, the defendants telexed the plaintiffs and denied that there was any such trade practice as alleged and that the contract had clearly stipulated that payment would be made by TT to the account of the defendants upon presentation of the bills of lading or delivery order.
At 17.16 pm, the plaintiffs replied that they were ready to pay upon presentation of the bills of lading.
On the following day, 16 November 1989, the plaintiffs telexed a reminder to the defendants to present the bills of lading. The defendants replied that since the plaintiffs showed by their last telex of the previous day that they had no intention of complying with the terms of the contract, the defendants had disposed of the goods.
In this action, the plaintiffs have claimed damages for breach of contract. The damages were US$38,750 for loss of profit on a sub-sale of the goods and US$6,250 being the additional sum the plaintiffs had to pay another supplier for the same goods in order to fulfil the sub-sale. The defendants denied liability, but surprising did not deny the amount of damages claimed even though the plaintiffs' two claims were compatible with each other.
The defendants denied that they were in breach of contract in failing to present the bills of lading on the grounds that (1) the plaintiffs had failed to make payment as requested and (2) the sale was subject to general condition 4 of the Sales Order that the sellers ""shall have the right to demand cash before delivery notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary"".
Both these defences have no merit. The terms of the contract are clear: payment upon presentation of the bills of lading or a delivery order. The defendants must present the documents called for before the plaintiffs were liable to pay. General condition 4 relied upon was overridden by the specific term of payment.
Before me, counsel for the defendants also contended that his clients had complied with the terms of the contract by inviting the plaintiffs to make payment to their bankers and collecting the bills of lading from or at the bankers. This raises an issue as to whether in a CIF contract there is a sufficient tender in law if the sellers send the bills of lading to their bankers and request the buyers to call at the said bankers to pay for and collect them. There appears to be no direct judicial authority on this point: see the cases discussed in Sassoon - CIF and FOB Contracts, 3rd Ed 1984, para 244. This is not a case where payment was to be effected under a letter of credit.
However, the point does not call for a decision here as there is nothing in the telexes sent by the defendants to the plaintiffs which stated that the bills of lading would be available for collection at the defendants' bankers in exchange for payment of the purchase price. The plaintiffs had merely been asked to pay the purchase price to the defendants' account with their bankers.
There is no defence to this action. The appeal is allowed with costs here and below to be fixed and/or assessed on the applicable scale. There will be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiffs for damages to be assessed by the Registrar with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of assessment.",1992-03-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
On 24 May 1986, the abovenamed Chia Ee Lin ('the petitioner') was lawfully married to the abovenamed Gwee Hak Theng ('the respondent'). Both are Advocates and Solicitors. At all material times, the petitioner was practising as a legal assistant to the respondent in the firm of Spencer Gwee & Co.
On 19 May 1988, a female child of the said marriage by the name of Samantha Gwee Shou Xi ('the child') was born.
On 14 June 1991, the petitioner fled from the matrimonial home at No.19, Jalan Buloh Perindu, Singapore, clad in T-shirt, shorts and slippers, leaving the child behind.
On 31 July 1991, the petitioner filed this Petition for divorce on the ground that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent as the respondent is a man of violent temper, abusive and insulting to her both in private and in public and had on many occasions used and/or threatened the use of violence on her person. The petitioner also prays for custody of the child.
As the petitioner was denied access to the child by the respondent since she fled from the matrimonial home, she applied by Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 on 16 August 1991 for sole custody, care and control of the child and for monthly maintenance for the child.
On 23 August 1991, Chan Sek Keong J., as he then was, made an interim order pending the disposal of this application, granting the petitioner interim access to the child on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5.00 pm to 8.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and on alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm. It was further ordered that access be effected by the respondent handing the child to the petitioner at the Mountbatten Community Centre. The child was also to be returned to the respondent at the said community centre at the end of the petitioner's access period. Leave was also given to the parties to cross examine all deponents of the affidavits.
On 30 August 1991, the petitioner filed an application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5481 of 1991 to vary the said interim order of Chan Sek Keong J. to the effect 'that pending the disposal of the application under Summons in Chambers No.5138 of 1991, the custody, care and control of the child ...' be forthwith vested in the petitioner with access to the respondent on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5.00 pm to 8.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and on alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm.
The application in Summons in Chambers No. 5481 of 1991 was heard by Chan Sek Keong J. on 5 September 1991. He varied his earlier order by giving additional access to the petitioner pending the hearing of her application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 then fixed on 10 September 1991 as follows:
(i) Thursday 5 September 1991 from 4.00 pm to 7.00 pm; (ii) Friday 6 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm but if the child was in kindergarten in the morning from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm; (iii) Saturday 7 September 1991 from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm; (iv) Sunday 8 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm and (v) Monday 9 September 1991 from 9.00 am to 2.00 pm but if the child was in kindergarten in the morning from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm.
The petitioner's application in Summons in Chambers entered No. 5138 of 1991 then came up for hearing before me on 10, 11, 19 and 23 September and it was then adjourned part heard. Pending the resumed hearing, I made an interim custody order in favour of the petitioner with access to the respondent on Mondays to Fridays daily from 6.00 pm to 9.00 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm, on Sundays from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. To reduce contact between the parties to the minimum, I also directed that access was to be effected by a relative or servant of the respondent picking up the child from the petitioner's residence at 41 Quemoy Road and the return by a relative or servant of the petitioner picking up the child from 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu.
The matter then came on for resumed hearing on 17 to 21 February, 2 to 5 March, 21 and 28 March and 31 March 1992. At the conclusion of the hearing I confirmed the interim custody order in favour of the petitioner, the respondent to have access to the child on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5.45 pm to 8.45 pm, on Saturdays from 2.00 pm to 6.00 pm and alternate Sundays from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. The child is to be picked up from and returned to 41 Quemoy Road by a relative of the respondent. I also ordered the respondent to pay monthly a sum of $1000 for the maintenance of the child with effect from 1 March 1992 and costs of this application. I also declared that there was no basis for the allegations made against third parties by the respondent in these proceedings. The respondent has appealed against my decision. I now give the grounds for my decision.
On custody, s 118 of the Women's Charter Cap 353 provides:
""In any suit for divorce, or for nullity of marriage, or for judicial separation, the court may, at any stage of the proceedings, or after a decree absolute has been pronounced, make such orders as it thinks fit with respect to the welfare of any child and may vary or discharge the said orders, and may, if it thinks fit, direct proceedings to be taken for placing the child under the protection of the court.""
In making any order for custody, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. See s 119 of the Women's Charter which states:
""(1)The court may at any time by order place a child in the custody of his or her father or his or her mother or < where there are exceptional circumstances making it undesirable that the child be entrusted to either parent > of any other relative of the child or of any organisation or association the objects of which include child welfare, or to any other suitable person. (2) In deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court shall have regard - (a)to the wishes of the parents of the child; and (b)to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.""
Similar provisions are to be found in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act Cap 122:
""Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody ... nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.""
Section 119(2) of the Women's Charter was considered by the Court of Appeal in Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold 
(1991) 2 MLJ 147
. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Chao Hick Tin J. at page 150 stated:
""Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children. It seemed to us clear that the learned judge had this foremost in his mind when he made the following observations: 'The practical application of this principle (i.e. s 119(2) of the Women's Charter) is not always easy in matrimonial causes disputes where custody is fought for, and children are almost the unfortunate objects of their parents' attention: more often than not, a court has to decide on a balance of various competing and conflicting considerations.' We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these: (i)the conduct of the parties; (ii)the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion; (iii)a young child would be best looked after by its mother; (iv)which party can offer better security and stability; and (v)that siblings should not be separated. We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflict.""
The child is a little girl born on 19 May 1988. She is the only child. When the petitioner was 7 months pregnant, and the scan showed the child to be a girl, the respondent showed his disappointment and walked out of the consultation room. On their return to the matrimonial home, he threw her things out and drove her out of the house. The respondent does not dispute his disappointment. He said at the hearing at page 53 of the Notes of Evidence:
""I was disappointed because my brother also had girls and they were also similarly disappointed. There are more girls in our family. This is no big deal. Put it you were unduly sensitive over my expression of disappointment.""
In support of her application for custody of the child the petitioner alleged physical violence by the respondent. These include but are not limited to the following:
(1)That in 1987 the respondent slapped the petitioner in her face so hard that she sustained a hairline fracture of the bridge of the nose. The respondent denied slapping her and causing the injury and deposed that the `petitioner had in fact hit her head by accident against the bedroom door. This occurred whilst she was in a tirade and a violent mood.' (2)That in September 1990 the respondent threatened her with a 12"" knife pressing it against her throat. The respondent admitted pointing the knife at the petitioner but not at the throat but sought to justify it by an alleged confession by the petitioner of adultery. The petitioner denied committing adultery and denied ever making any confession of adultery. To this date, no co-respondent has been cited. On the `knife' incident the respondent during the hearing admitted under cross-examination at page 167-168 of the Notes of Evidence as follows:
""Q:On the September 1990 incident (knife incident) do you agree it was a 12"" knife?
A:It is a normal knife taken from the kitchen. It could be about 12"".
Q:How close were you from her?
A:From where I was pointing the knife and the tip of the blade is about 6"" from her face.""
(3)That sometime between December 1990 and February 1991, the respondent went to her room at their law office, locked the door and then abused and assaulted her. The respondent confirmed the occurrence of this incident but gave his version as follows: `This incident did not occur in the manner described by the petitioner. There was an argument in the office concerning her name being included in the office unit that I was purchasing. In fact the petitioner had attempted to push me against the wall but she lost her balance and knocked herself against the table. I took her to the doctor.' (4)That in the evening of 14 June 1991, the respondent who had always refused to attend any of the petitioner's family functions, tried to force her to attend a wedding dinner with him. She refused and locked herself in her bedroom. They had been sleeping in separate rooms by then. She had also by then been sleeping with a 7 iron golf club by her side as protection against the respondent. The respondent tried to break down her bedroom door. The petitioner telephoned the respondent's sister Juliet Khoo and requested her to talk to the respondent over the telephone to calm him down. After receiving a call from Juliet, the respondent is said to have shouted: `call Juliet to embarrass me, will you. I will smash your face. It will be worth 5 years.' He then attempted again to break down the bedroom door. Fearing for her life, she fled through the other door of the room, ran down the staircase and out of the house clad only in shorts, T-shirt and wearing a pair of slippers. She jumped into the first taxi that came along and did not return to live at the matrimonial home thereafter. This incident was substantially confirmed by the respondent when he deposed: `Although the petitioner had intimated that she was coming that night to my family's dinner, she refused to come, taunting me from behind the locked bedroom. I gave her 10 minutes to dress and was on the verge of leaving the home when I received a telephone call from my sister, Mrs Juliet Khoo, informing me that the petitioner refused to come. I went upstairs and shook the collapsible door between our bedrooms but she left from the < other > door of her room without my knowing this. I did not see her nor did I know what she was wearing when she left. I did not threaten her nor did I force her out of the house.' The respondent's version, in my view, confirmed the petitioner's version. There was no reason for the petitioner to telephone Juliet Khoo just to tell her the petitioner was not going to the dinner. Juliet Khoo obviously telephoned the respondent at the request of the petitioner to try to calm him as alleged by the petitioner. (5)That their maid Susanita Almendralejo (`Susanita') was assaulted by the respondent for allowing the petitioner into the matrimonial home to visit the child. The respondent is said to have slapped the maid on the face and pulled her hair. Susanita in her affidavit deposed as follows: `On 24 July 1991, the petitioner came to the house to see her daughter. She asked me to open the gate for her to enter. I agreed to do so as I was very unhappy that Samantha could not see her mother. The petitioner spent about 20 minutes with Samantha. She left when the respondent's mother telephoned the respondent at the office to inform him that the petitioner was in the house. About half an hour later, the respondent returned to the house. He was very angry at me for opening the gate and allowing the petitioner in. He shouted at me. He pulled my hair, squeezed my neck with his hands and slapped my face.' The respondent denied the allegation but in so denying seemed to admit to pulling her hair. `... I did chastise the maid but I did not do more than hold her hair to vent my frustration to the maid for ignoring my instructions not to open the door and not to let the petitioner into the matrimonial home without contacting me.' The respondent also refused to pay Susanita her salary and did not allow her any days off. It subsequently also emerged that he refused to release her personal belongings which to this day are still with the respondent. I found the respondent's explanation for not paying Susanita incredible. The explanation in the letter from his solicitors to the petitioner's solicitors, being exhibit CEL-2 to the petitioner's affidavit of 30 August 1991 read: `The arrangement made with the maid is that her wages are kept and this is within the knowledge of your client.' But see page 42 of the Notes of Evidence when the petitioner was being cross-examined by the respondent:
""Q: Did you know Susanita was unhappy because I was keeping her salary?
A: I did not know she was unhappy and I did not know she had not been paid until much later.""
Quite clearly payment of the maid's salary was withheld by the respondent without the consent of the maid and not in accordance with arrangements made with her. Eventually Susanita ran away on 25 August 1991 and sought refuge in the home of her former employer one Deborah Tsui. (6)That on 18 August 1991, the petitioner telephoned the matrimonial home and informed the respondent's mother that she was coming to visit the child. She arrived at 11.00 am accompanied by her friend Anita Chew who is also an Advocate and Solicitor. On their arrival, they found the door open but the gate was locked. The petitioner rang the bell for 10-15 minutes but there was no response. She then climbed over the gate, entered the house through the open door and went up to the second level by the staircase. The respondent suddenly appeared and assaulted her and tried to push her down the staircase. Her screams alerted Anita Chew who climbed over the gate and rushed into the house. Only then did the respondent stop assaulting the petitioner. The petitioner then telephoned the police who arrived shortly thereafter. (7)On 2 September 1991, there were two incidents at the Mountbatten Community Centre, one at 5.00 pm and the other at 8.00 pm. At 5.00 pm the petitioner accompanied by her father, PW2, arrived to pick up the child for her access period. They alleged that the respondent kept abusing PW2 saying `you got no balls'. In the 8.00 pm incident, the respondent called PW2 `useless bastard, dog, lousy grand father, bloody coward'. PW2 then came out of his car to reason with the respondent saying: `be sensible, you are here on a court order not on your own free will, why do you self-destruct and later as always blame it on others, I do not want to quarrel with you.' The respondent is said to have retorted while raving: `All this is rubbish. Nonsense.' He then kicked PW2 in the thigh and punched him on the forehead causing his glasses to fall off. The respondent then turned on the petitioner, squeezed her neck and threw her onto the ground a couple of times. In his affidavit filed on 9 September 1991, the respondent gave his version of these two incidents as follows: `I did not abuse her father. I merely walked over to him to talk to him and to tell him that he should not pretend to be an honest man and allow his daughter to behave and proceed in the manner she was doing. I deny saying the words alleged in para 4 of the petitioner's affidavit. At 8.00 pm on that day, when I arrived at the Mountbatten Community Centre to pick Samantha up, I wished to continue talking to the petitioner's father. I did not abuse him in the words stated in para 9 of the petitioner's affidavit. What I did say was that he should be more responsible as a father and stop pretending. He did not remain silent as suggested. Instead he started to be hysterical, shouting at me. It was he who took a swing at me and I avoided him by ducking and raising my leg. In fact, I am not quite sure if my leg touched his body. It was at this point of time that I heard my mother shouting. I turned and saw my mother struggling and the petitioner was snatching Samantha from my mother. I ran towards them, snatching Samantha away from the petitioner with one hand and with the other I grabbed the petitioner by the neck and pushed her whereupon she fell to the ground. I definitely did not squeeze her neck as suggested. Neither do I recall getting hold of her neck a second time. She may have gotten up from the ground after falling and I could have pushed her again.'
The petitioner's father is a retired school teacher aged 55, height 5 ft 2 in. and had undergone an operation for cancer. Would he have initiated the fight by swinging at the respondent who denies kicking him but so coincidentally `avoided him by ducking and raising his leg'? There was also no reason for the petitioner to snatch the child back moments after she had first handed over the child at the end of her access period. The injuries alleged by her to have been caused by strangulation and her being thrown onto the ground were supported by the medical report and photographs annexed to the petitioner's affidavit of 4 September 1991. The medical report listed the following injuries:
(i)Bruised marks on the neck, consistent with attempted strangulation; (ii)Abrasions on palms and right elbow most probably due to a fall; (iii)Stiffness of the neck with paravertebral spasm; (iv)Tenderness over the right gluteal region.
The medical report was by Dr Low Tze Choong of Toa Payoh Hospital to which the petitioner was admitted on 2 September 1991 following the incidents at the Mountbatten Community Centre and discharged on 4 September 1991. The injuries were still visible on 10 September 1991 when the petitioner testified for the first time before me. The spread of the injuries on the neck was consistent with her being strangled with both hands.
The petitioner had previous to 14 June 1991, left home on three occasions allegedly also because of the respondent's physical violence. But on each of these previous occasions, she had been persuaded to return home.
In answer to these allegations of violence against him, the respondent persistently accused her of misappropriation and that her parents purchased 41 Quemoy Road with the proceeds of her misappropriation. In his affidavit of 14 February 1991, he stated:
""... The real truth is that the petitioner's parents have benefitted from the ill gotten gains of the petitioner. As mentioned, they have bought a house out of the blue for $515,000/- cash when I have lost half a million.""
The respondent refused to accept that the petitioner's father purchased this property on retirement with his gratuities and Central Provident Fund savings and he also sold his smaller house at Serangoon Garden Estate to upgrade to living in this bigger house. See page 50 of the Notes of Evidence when the respondent was cross-examining the petitioner.
""Q: At that time I was particularly aggravated by the fact that your father was buying another property and I did not know where he could have the money. I ask you where your father could have the money to buy a second property.
A: Respondent did not ask me where my father could have the money. He knew that my father had just retired and would be drawing his CPF and gratuity and the respondent lamented that the civil service paid incompetent people implying my father so well that they could afford to buy a second house.""
The absurdity of this allegation is apparent when one examines the earnings of the respondent. When the petitioner married the respondent on 24 May 1986, it was just about one month after the he lost his job as a legal assistant earning a salary of $6000-$7000 a month. He then started his own firm and later the petitioner joined him. He gave the gross earnings of his firm during the 5 years from 1986 to 1991 as follows:
(1) for the first year, they ran a loss after drawings of $6000 to $7000 a month. Expenses amounted to $7000 to $8000 a month; (2) for the second year, their gross earnings were around $200,000 for the year with expenses of $7000 to $8000 a month; (3) for the third year, their gross earnings were between $250,000 to $300,000 but expenses amounted to $10,000 a month; (4) for the fourth and fifth years, their gross earnings were between $320,000 to $350,000 a year but expenses went up to $13,000 a month.
The matrimonial home at No 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu and their office premises were purchased with loans from financial institutions and consequently mortgage repayments had to be made. See the evidence of the petitioner under cross examination by the respondent at page 70 of the Notes of Evidence.
""Q: I suggest to you that you left on 14/6/91 because among other reasons by then you had your name included in the purchase of the house and office unit, so it was time to move on?
A: Utter rubbish. The purchase was on 80%- 90% mortgage ...""
It seems obvious that the respondent could not have $500,000 to be embezzled by the petitioner to finance her father's purchase of 41 Quemoy Road.
Pressing on with his claim all along that the petitioner was committing criminal misappropriation, he alleged that she then engineered the incidents of assaults on her thus giving her cause for leaving the matrimonial home each time to avoid her misappropriation being detected. See Notes of Evidence at page 46 where the respondent was cross-examining the petitioner:
""Q: Put it to you that you ran off in the way you did was because it was a matter of time before I could find out about your committing CBT for the last five years?
A: Totally absurd.""
Again at page 64:
""Q: You agree you left home on 4 occasions? A: Yes.
Q: Put it you kept on running away from home because you had taken the $100,000 and created these incidents to run away?
A: Not true.""
See the evidence of the respondent under cross-examination by counsel for the petitioner at page 167 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: You alleged that two other occasions, in which she left home namely in December 1990 and 14.6.91 were also because she had created this incident to run away as an excuse because she was afraid she would be discovered?
A: Yes. In December 1990 she disappeared for a month. The maid Lena managed to retrace the location where she was living. I got my mother and sister to go inside and talk to her. During that period she turned up at the office. On one occasion she handed the account books and pushed them to me saying 'you deal with this. From now on I am prepared to work for you free of charge'. These two incidents are connected to her fear of being discovered. This was her way of telling me she had done wrong.""
At page 169:
""Q: You had claimed petitioner had connived to milk you over the years on the instigation of her parents. See your affidavit of 23.1.92 para 11(f)(i) and from questions you put to the petitioner you suggested that after she had taken the $100,000 from the capital gain from sale of the Watten Estate house, she created 3 incidents to run away from home viz: (i) the knife incident (ii) the December 1990 incident (door slamming) (iii) the 14.6.91 incident because she wanted to run away for fear of being discovered. Do you maintain this?
A: Yes. I maintain this.""
One would have thought the surest way to cover up her misdeeds is for her to stay on especially when she was in charge of the office administration and accounts. This absurdity is all the more apparent when one bears in mind that the `knife incident' was said by the respondent to have been provoked by the petitioner's alleged confession of adultery.
In June 1991, the respondent's office accounts had a credit balance of only $10,000. This was seized on by the respondent as the reason for the petitioner running away on 14 June 1991 for good because there was very little left to steal. See page 60 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: Put it you remained in the marriage to me for five years was because you were helping yourself to the money from my firm. By June 1991 there was very little for you to help yourself and this was one of the two reasons you left me?
A: Absurd. When I first married him, he was unemployed. Subsequently we even had to borrow money from my parents from time to time. I can adduce proof of cheques. In particular to purchase the first Mercedez in 1988 and then again when we purchased 19 Jalan Buloh Perindu a sum of $50,000 was borrowed from my mother to pay the 10% deposit. I think there were other small loans in between but I cannot remember.
Q: Put it to you I never had to borrow from your mother. I agree we borrowed the $40,000 for the Mercedez but it was only a bridging loan for a week or so?
A: I cannot remember how long the loan was for. But I was trying to make the point how could he say I was there to take his money when in fact there was no money and we had to borrow from my mother.""
Equally baseless was the respondent's suggestion that the slight injuries sustained by his mother in a scuffle with the petitioner in the said incident on 2 September 1991 at the Mountbatten Community Centre caused his mother's death on 23 October 1991. In fact his mother died of cancer. In his affidavit of 23 January 1991 paras 6(e)(iii) and (iv) he stated:
""On 23rd October 1991 my mother Madam Goh passed away. This was some 7 weeks after the petitioner assaulted her on the 2nd September 1991 outside Mounbatten Community Centre. She was of good health all along. In great measure, as a result of the petitioner's conduct and attack, she fell ill and was unable to recover."" ""... I had to attend to my mother who was ill from 2nd September 1991, and to bear the 49 days period of bereavement after her death.""
He repeated this accusation under cross-examination. At page 179 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: Your mother passed away, she died of cancer on October 1991. The cancer - 6 weeks before she died. See your affidavit of 23.1.92 para 6(e). You said 'she was of good health all along'. In 6(e)(iii) you said 'she fell ill as a result of petitioner's conduct and attack and was unable to recover'. Do you still maintain these statements?
A: Yes, fully and unreservedly. The good health part was as at 24.7.91 to 25.8.91. She was in good health although she had chronic problems and had to take medicine but she was up and about. There were months she was ill and we had to give her medicine and she would recover. But after that community centre attack her health became worse and became quite bad and never recovered this time. She was fairly heart broken by that Mountbatten CC incident. In the Anita Chew incident she told the petitioner that she loved petitioner like gold in Chinese. She did not understand why petitioner was coming to create trouble. She was 76 years. If there was no attack on her on 2.9.91 my mother would not have passed away so suddenly.""
According to the petitioner all she did was to push the respondent's mother aside to get to the child who was crying while seated in respondent's car during that incident at the Mountbatten Community Centre. Whatever injuries the respondent's mother sustained in the scuffle could not have caused her death.
The respondent also suggested that the petitioner instructed Mr Davinder Singh because he is a Member of Parliament, and further suggested that she went to Toa Payoh Hospital for treatment because her lawyer was the Member of Parliament for Toa Payoh. See the respondent's evidence under cross-examination at page 173 of the Notes of Evidence:
""Q: You have alleged in your cross-examination of petitioner and her father that on evening of 2.9.91 they went to Toa Payoh Hospital because `your lawyer was Mr Davinder Singh and M.P. for Toa Payoh it will be helpful to you, you could blow it up. It will be helpful because of this M.P. and you are going to a government hospital'?
A: My allegation speaks for itself. I maintain I had basis to ask those questions. One of the reasons petitioner's father wanted to put pressure on me by selecting Mr Davinder Singh, a PAP M.P. They did not choose any other lawyer. This is a small divorce matter in terms of issues.
Q: What was the pressure on you by selecting Davinder Singh?
A: Unless we are duffers we live in a country and in this system if you are an M.P. from the ruling party you have certain amount of weight. He can call some shots more than others. The point is Albert < petitioner's father > was trying to intimidate me.""
The truth of the matter is the petitioner after being assaulted at the Mountbatten Community Centre on 2 September 1991 at 8.00 pm went with her father to a private hospital in the East Coast area but was turned away by a doctor in that hospital who said it would be a police case and they did not wish to be involved. The petitioner and her father then proceeded to Toa Payoh Hospital which is the closest to their house at Quemoy Road. Mr Davinder singh was also not the lawyer the petitioner specially sought out. She had sought the advice of a solicitor Mrs Quek Bee See who referred her to Mr Sachi Saurajen of the law firm of Drew & Napier. Mr Saurajen then assigned her matter to a Mr Morris John who was not available. It then went to Mr Davinder Singh. Mr Davinder Singh initially appeared with Mr Jimmy Yim but subsequently applied to be released as he had to attend to other matters, leaving this matter completely in the hands of Mr Jimmy Yim.
In the course of conducting his own case at the resumed hearing against repeated advice from the court to instruct counsel (Court offered to adjourn the hearing for this purpose), the respondent persisted on what he termed `robust' cross examination. He was represented by counsel at the earlier hearing. Through affidavits, cross examination and submissions, he heaped abuses without justification on all those associated with the petitioner even distantly. I set out below some of the unflattering remarks or references made or uttered by the respondent.
Against the petitioner: a can of worms; congenital liar devoid of any redeeming merit; utter lack of self-respect and complete lack of shame, steeped in mediocrity, first rate fortune hunter, fundamentally dishonest person; hypocritical gone case; an eternal problem; avaricious; immature petulant flighty; a quitter; ornamental; self made failure; a turn coat, a freak.
Against the petitioner's father PW2: mongrel dog; dastardly person; 3rd rate fellar; deep-seated self acknowledged inferiority; weakling; cowardly by nature; unable to see no further than his own nose; he ate dirt.
Against the petitioner's mother: petty, small minded, envious, malicious and vindictive person; suffer from inferiority complex; an insipid and rather wicked hearted person; plain evil, not only small-time but truly wicked; evil hearted human.
Against the petitioner's younger brother: lily livered boy, cowers and grovels.
Against one TBK, PW4, a female friend of the petitioner: a freak, conduct worse than atrocious, intermeddler, busybody. Even her husband was not spared.
Against the maid, PW6: impertinent, dishonest, malicious and deceitful, slow-headed, morals of an alley cat.
Against Mr Jimmy Yim, Counsel for the petitioner: he bowed and scraped before Your Honour. I found it too demeaning to do so; counsel is a paid hireling, he was lapping to Your Honour, to Davinder Singh, Mr Sachi Saurajen (instructed to carry the can after Davinder Singh).
Thus on the evidence before me, the respondent is clearly a man easily prone to violence and abusive in nature.
On stable home environment, the petitioner since she fled from the matrimonial home on 14 June 1991 had been staying with her parents and her younger brother at No. 41 Quemoy Road, Singapore. Her father aged 55, is a junior college teacher. After retirement, he taught part-time for a little while at the Regional English Language Centre. Her mother aged 53 is an ex-primary school teacher. She is bi-lingual. Both are healthy. Her brother at the time of the hearing was still a law student at the National University of Singapore. The maid Susanita to whom the child is very attached had gone to work for the petitioner. The petitioner's parents were supportive and were ready to help the petitioner look after the child. Their educational background will enhance the child's development.
The respondent on the other hand was mainly relying on his mother before her death and for a few days after Susanita ran away his sister Molly Chua and a male cousin Peter Kee. From the evidence before me, it was obvious that Molly Chua and Peter Kee could not be expected to assist as part of a long term arrangement. So also was the case of the sister-in-law Catherine Gwee. Molly Chua has her own family with two teenage daughters. She runs a family business known as Fullness Trading Pte Ltd. She doesn't drive and depends on her husband for transport. But her husband has had a quadruple heart by-pass and he must require care and attention himself. Peter Kee is a bachelor of over 30 years old. He lives at Whampoa Drive, a long distance from the matrimonial home. He lives with and looks after his father. He does not drive. Catherine Gwee has a family of her own. She has four children between the ages of 7 and 14. So even with a new maid that the respondent employed in place of Susanita, I had no doubt that the child would have a better and more stable environment living with the petitioner than with the respondent.
Thus taking principally the above factors into account, namely, the child being a little girl of 3 years old, the respondent's violent and abusive nature and his conduct, better educational and home environment in the petitioner's parents' home and the support of the petitioner's parents in looking after the child, I was of the view that in the interest of the child, custody should be awarded to the petitioner. In doing so, I awarded liberal access to the respondent.
In fairness to third parties who have been maligned in these proceedings by the respondent, I also declared that there is no basis for the attacks made against them by the respondent.",1992-07-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The plaintiffs' claim, inter alia, is for an injunction restraining the defendants from passing off or attempting to pass off cordless telephone sets bearing the trade mark ""COMO"", which do not have any connection in the course of trade with the plaintiffs, as the plaintiffs' goods.
The plaintiffs filed a Notice of Motion seeking the following orders:
1. The defendants, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, servants or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever be restrained and an injunction is hereby granted restraining them from doing the following acts, that is to say, passing off or attempting to pass off, causing, enabling, or assisting to pass off cordless telephone sets not having any connection in the course of trade with the plaintiffs as and for the plaintiffs' goods by the use of the trade mark ""COMO"" trade mark on the said goods or by any other means until after the trial of this action or until further order.
2. The costs of this application be costs in the cause.
The affidavit of Sun Chap Ting, the Managing Director of the first plaintiffs and a Director of the second plaintiffs, insofar as it is relevant to this Motion, is to this effect:
The first plaintiffs were incorporated in 1974 and are in the business of selling car radio and cassette players and television sets. The first plaintiffs sell extensively the aforesaid goods under the trade mark ""COMO"" both locally and abroad to Malaysia and Thailand.
The second plaintiffs were incorporated in 1983 and are in the business of selling, inter alia, car radio and cassette players, television sets and one piece extension telephone sets. Since their incorporation the second plaintiffs have been selling extensively the aforesaid goods under the trade mark ""COMO"" in conjunction with the first plaintiffs in Singapore and to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
In December 1986, the plaintiffs commenced the use of the ""COMO"" trade mark on cordless telephone sets. These cordless telephone sets could not be sold within Singapore without the approval from Telecoms Singapore, but could be re-exported. The plaintiffs sold to two companies in Singapore the ""COMO"" cordless telephone sets for re-export to countries in Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Europe, Middle East, Africa and the Persian Gulf. The plaintiffs submitted monthly sales returns to Telecoms Singapore accounting for the export to the aforesaid countries. The submissions of these monthly returns were a requirement of Telecoms Singapore.
On 4 August 1987, the second plaintiffs filed an application to register ""COMO"" as a trade mark in respect of telephones, telephone apparatus and equipment, radio and car stereos, television, video in Class 9 in their own name under Application No 3709/87 to hold for the joint benefit of the first and second plaintiffs. The said application is still pending. This arrangement was formalised by an Agreement dated 28 March 1989 made between the first and the second plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have a wide range of ""COMO"" brand telephones for sale. In May 1988 and January 1989 the first plaintiffs obtained the approval of Telecoms Singapore to sell in Singapore the ""COMO"" cordless telephone sets model COMO 1000 and COMO 1000 DX.
Since the commencement of the first plaintiffs' use of the trade mark ""COMO"" on cordless telephone sets in December 1986 to October 1991, the first plaintiffs have imported and sold 86,240 sets. The plaintiffs have sold their cordless telephone sets in Singapore for the past five years amounting to S$9,005,039.22.
The plaintiffs have also extensively advertised their products and have expended the sum of S$155,410.00 for the past five years.
The second plaintiffs have applied for and obtained the registration of the ""COMO"" trade mark in China, South Korea, France, Thailand and Burma.
The first plaintiffs' associates, Santo Corporation have applied to register the ""COMO"" trade mark in Japan. The application is still pending. In anticipation of registration, Santo Corporation have agreed to assign all rights in respect of the ""COMO"" trade mark in Japan to the first plaintiffs and an Agreement to assign was entered into between Santo Corporation and the first plaintiffs in August 1991.
The plaintiffs have always been careful to protect their common law rights in the ""COMO"" trade mark in Singapore. The second plaintiffs published a Warning Notice in the 23 January 1988 issue of the Straits Times. A response to the Warning Notice came from Associated Enterprise Inc of Japan (AEI). Their solicitors wrote to the second plaintiffs demanding the withdrawal of the second plaintiffs' claim to the ""COMO"" trade mark. The second plaintiffs refused to withdraw their claim to the ""COMO"" trade mark and no further action was taken by AEI.
In or about September 1988, the plaintiffs discovered that Fontel Electronic was selling telephone sets bearing the plaintiffs' ""COMO"" trade mark. It was discovered that Fontel Electronic obtained the infringing goods from a distributor Wahgo International Corporation Pte Ltd and Wahgo International Corporation Pte Ltd revealed that the infringing goods were obtained from AEI.
On or about 24 July 1991 the plaintiffs discovered that telephones bearing the ""COMO"" trade mark were being imported by the defendants. A trap purchase was made by the plaintiffs' agents who purchased from the defendants a ""JAPAN COMO Model No 5000 MKII"" for S$220 and a ""JAPAN COMO model No 90000"" for S$740.
The Motion came before me on 11 February 1992. Defendants' counsel raised this preliminary objection: the plaintiffs' solicitors were acting in conflict of duty/interest as solicitors in acting for the plaintiffs in this action.
Defendants' counsel informed me that he had not heard from the Law Society.
The defendants' grounds for the objection said defendants' counsel were set out in the affidavit of Jenna Leong, General Manager of the defendant company. She deposed that as long ago as 18 September 1991 the plaintiffs' solicitors Drew & Napier had been put on notice of their being in conflict of interest and duty in acting for the plaintiffs and she exhibited copies of correspondence between the defendants' solicitors and the plaintiffs' solicitors on the matter.
In their first letter of 18 September 1991 the defendants' solicitors said that it had come to the defendants' knowledge that Drew & Napier were acting for Yugen Kaisha Como of Japan in their application (No S/5005/91) filed on 17 May 1991 in the Singapore Registry of Trade Marks & Patents to register ""JAPAN COMO"" as a trade mark in Class 9 and the instructions to make the application were given to Drew & Napier by T Sato, a patent attorney from Tokyo, pursuant to a Power of Attorney given to him by AEI, clients of the defendants' solicitors, Peter Chua, Sobaran & Partners. The defendants' solicitors expressed the view that in the circumstances there was a conflict of interest in Drew & Napier acting for Yugen Kaisha Como in the aforesaid application and for the first plaintiffs in the alleged passing off of ""COMO"" telephones in Singapore. The defendants' solicitors asked for the views of Drew & Napier on an urgent basis and in any event not later than 4.00pm on Friday, 20 September 1991.
Drew & Napier promptly replied on 19 September 1991, confirming that they filed a trade mark application in the name of Yugen Kaisha Como in Class 9 for the trade mark ""JAPAN COMO"" on the instructions of a Japanese patent firm but not the T Sato that was mentioned by defendants' solicitors. Drew & Napier further stated that they were not instructed about the involvement of AEI in the application and that that was the first time they had knowledge of it. Drew & Napier further stated that in view of the dispute between AEI and the first plaintiffs they would cease to act for Yugen Kaisha Como in their trade mark application No S/5005/91 and that they were informing the Japanese patent attorney of this immediately.
By their letter of 20 September 1991, the defendants' solicitors asked Drew & Napier to confirm that they would also cease to act for the first plaintiffs.
In their reply the same day, Drew & Napier asked the defendants' solicitors to let them know why they should cease to act for the first plaintiffs.
On 23 September 1991, the defendants' solicitors gave the following reply:
Re Alleged Passing Off of ""COMO"" Telephones in Singapore
As we understand it, you have acted for Great Wall (Importers & Exporters) Pte Ltd (""Great Wall"") as long ago as early 1989.
In 1991, you received instructions to apply to register ""JAPAN COMO"" from a party who were themselves an agent of and further, instructed by our client, Associated Enterprises Inc.
After we put you on notice of the conflict of interest and duty in your acting for both said parties, you suddenly decided that you owed a greater duty and responsibility to your first client, Great Wall.
A corollary of your decision was that you held a lesser duty to your second client.
With the utmost respect, we disagree.
We submit that you also owe an equally compelling duty to Yugen Kaisha Como (""YKC"") as you do to Great Wall, having been put in confidence by YKC in their application to register a mark that is the same, if not substantially and materially the same, as the mark that Great Wall is claiming to be owners of, to the exclusion of all others.
Again with respect, we contend that it is therefore not appropriate for you to continue acting for YKC in the latter's said application and for Great Wall in the above matter.
On 25 September 1991 Drew & Napier replied to the defendants' solicitors stating that ""In the matter between Associated Enterprises Inc and our clients, Great Wall (Importers & Exporters) Pte Ltd we are not in conflict"". Drew & Napier said that they would be transferring the file of Yugen Kaisha Como's trade mark application to the defendants' solicitors.
On 26 September 1991 the defendant's solicitors replied that they disagreed with the stand taken by Drew & Napier and said that as the issue at hand involved professional ethics they proposed to refer the matter to the Law Society for the latter's views.
The very same day Drew & Napier wrote the following letter to the defendants' solicitors:
Re Passing Off of COMO Telephones in Singapore
As we have stated in our earlier letter of 25 September 1991, there is no question about our firm being in any conflict of interest in respect of our clients, Great Wall (Importers & Exporters) Pte Ltd claim against your clients, Associated Enterprises Inc (""AEI""). Our clients claim against your clients is in passing off. We have never acted for AEI in any matter relating to our clients' said claim nor are we in possession of any confidential information about AEI.
Please let us know whether your clients are prepared to give an undertaking to stop the export, sale and distribution of telephones and other electrical/electronic devices with the name ""Como"", failing which we have instructions to take action against your clients.
In respect of your new clients, Yugen Kaisha Como, we no longer have any conflict of interest in respect of their trade mark application and that matter rests here. We must reiterate that at no material time was there any information nor suggestion that Yugen Kaisha was related to your clients, Associated Enterprises Inc. Further we find it very strange that Yugen Kaisha is allegedly merely an agent of your client in the registration of the mark ""Japan Como"". As you know, an agent is not the proprietor of the mark and has no locus to apply for registration.
If you wish to refer the matter of whether we are in conflict of interest in respect of our clients' claim against your clients, AEI to the Law Society, you are at liberty to do so.
The defendants' solicitors then wrote to the Law Society on 5 October 1991. On 7 Oct 1991 the Executive Director of the Law Society informed the defendants' solicitors that the matter would be referred to the Chairman, Rules & Etiquette Committee, for his attention and that the Committee's decision would be conveyed in due course.
On 25 October 1991 Drew & Napier wrote to the defendants' solicitors asking for an immediate reply to para 2 of their letter of 26 September 1991 as they had instructions to commence proceedings.
On 31 October 1991 the defendants' solicitors wrote to Drew & Napier stating that the defendants took objection to Drew & Napier continuing to act for the first plaintiffs; that to date they had not received a substantive response from the Law Society and ended the letter in these words:
If your client is adamant about commencing proceedings in the meantime, we are instructed to request that they engage another firm of solicitors, in place of yourselves, to undertake such proceedings.
On 2 November 1991 Drew & Napier wrote to the defendants's solicitors that until the defendants obtained a substantive response from the Law Society confirming the defendants' position that Drew & Napier were in conflict, Drew & Napier remained on record as solicitors for the first plaintiffs and asked defendants' solicitors to continue to address all further correspondence to them.
Murgiana Haq, a partner in Drew & Napier and the solicitor responsible for trade mark registration matters, filed an affidavit in reply to the affidavit of Jenna Leong. Her affidavit is to this effect:
She has knowledge of the facts pertaining to Trade Mark Application No S/5005/91 for the trade mark ""JAPAN COMO"" in Singapore.
Messrs Takahashi, a trade mark and patent firm in Tokyo, Japan, instructed Drew & Napier by letter dated 9 May 1991, to file two trade mark applications, one of which was ""JAPAN COMO"". The application was to be filed in the name of Yugen Kaisha Como, a Japanese Corporation, and the goods to be covered by the application were ""transceiver, cordless telephone"". The letter was signed by Yasuo Takahashi, Patent Attorney.
The application was filed with the Registrar of Trade Marks, Singapore, and Application No S/5005/91 with the official filing date of 17 May 1991 was issued. Between that date and the transfer of the application to Messrs Peter Chua, Sobaran & Partners on 25 September 1991, there was no development in this application. All the instructions received from Messrs Takahashi were contained in their letter of 9 May 1991 and save for Drew & Napier's letter of 14 May 1991 advising them on a minor amendment to the specification of goods to be filed, there were no further instructions from Messrs Takahashi.
Drew & Napier were not instructed of any connection between the Applicant, Yugen Kaisha Como and AEI. It was only after Drew & Napier received the defendants' solicitors' letter of 18 September 1991 that Drew & Napier became aware of the connection between Yugen Kaisha Como and AEI. As soon as Drew & Napier became aware of this association, they immediately replied to defendants' solicitors that they would cease to act for Yugen Kaisha Como in their trade mark application and they took the necessary steps to transfer their file to defendants' solicitors.
Drew & Napier did not receive any confidential information from Yugen Kaisha Como or their trade mark attorney Messrs Takahashi in the matter of the trade mark application and no information about Yugen Kaisha Como's business or its connection with AEI was given to Drew & Napier.
The main contention of the defendants was that Drew & Napier received confidential information when they filed the trade mark application for Yugen Kaisha Como. The defendants, however, had not adduced any evidence what was the confidential information received by Drew & Napier. The affidavit of Murgiana Haq positively stated that Drew & Napier were not in possession of any confidential information.
I was satisfied that Drew & Napier were not in possession of any confidential information and I found that there was no conflict of interest or duty in Drew & Napier acting for the plaintiffs.
I said that I would proceed to hear the Motion. Defendants' counsel applied for an adjournment so that the defendants could file an affidavit on the merits. I refused to grant an adjournment.
The Motion before me dealt with a claim between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The preliminary objection raised by the defendants was against Drew & Napier. On the authorities, the proper approach for the defendants, if they felt that Drew & Napier were in a position of conflict, was to institute proceedings against Drew & Napier and apply for an injunction to restrain Drew & Napier from acting in this matter. It was not open to the defendants to raise this as an issue in the present proceedings which were between the plaintiffs and the defendants and did not concern Drew & Napier.
The plaintiffs' solicitors had sent two letters to the defendants' solicitors, one on 24 January 1992 and the other on 25 January 1992 giving them notice that if the defendants' preliminary objection was overruled they would ask for the interim injunction.
To grant the adjournment would prejudice the plaintiffs. The application for adjournment was another attempt by the defendants to delay the hearing of this Motion.
I made an order in terms of prayers 1 and 2 of the Motion. I also ordered that the defendants pay the costs of their application on the preliminary objection.",1992-03-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
This Originating Summons was taken out in relation to the question of the custody of two infants, one Phang Min Chuan, male, born on 7 November 1981 and the other Peng Xiao Su, female, born on 30 December 1983. The plaintiff, aged 32, is the mother and the defendant, aged 39, the father. The parties were married on 15 July 1980 at the Registry of Marriages. The plaintiff is a clerk and the defendant, a tour-coach driver.
The parties gave different versions of the causes of the break-up of the marriage. Each party also asserted that he or she was better able to take care of the children. At the request of both parties I directed the Child Welfare Service of the Ministry of Community Development to inquire into the background of the case and put up a report. Upon giving due consideration to the affidavits of the parties and the welfare report, I decided to grant custody of the two children to the defendant. I ordered that the plaintiff shall have weekly access to them between 5.00pm Saturday and 5.00pm Sunday. Furthermore, I also gave the plaintiff additional access to the children during the school vacations; she is to have access during the first half of the periods of the school vacations in June and in November/December each year. The plaintiff is dissatisfied with my rulings and has appealed to the Court of Appeal.
In her first affidavit the plaintiff said that the defendant was always finding fault with her and the children. He had more interest in playing mahjong than in the welfare of the children. In her second affidavit she alleged that the defendant pampered the children and has a violent disposition. The defendant denied that he was a person who did not care for the plaintiff and the children. He gave examples of what he did for them to illustrate that he cared. While he admitted that he sometimes play mahjong (infrequently he said) with his colleagues, he alleged that the plaintiff was herself a habitual gambler, and on occasions would gamble the whole night through. He also alleged that the plaintiff is associating rather closely with another man, one Tan Swee Lim. I would note that this allegation was not denied by the plaintiff in her second affidavit though she refuted a lot of other things. The defendant averred that the plaintiff is not a concerned mother.
Matters came to a head on 31 March 1990 when the plaintiff left the matrimonial home bringing with her the two children. She brought the children to her mother's home. The mother helped the plaintiff to take care of them until about 10 May 1990 when the defendant took them away. The defendant explained that he was quite prepared to accept that arrangement and let the plaintiff have the children until he discovered that the plaintiff herself was not staying with her parents and that she had simply left the children with her parents. On this aspect the plaintiff, while admitting that the children were left with her mother, explained that she did that because she feared for their safety in the event that the defendant should confront them as the defendant is a person of ""violent disposition"". The plaintiff said that she was then staying with her younger sister. However, I would add that there is hardly any real evidence to show that the defendant was violent towards his children or would harm them.
The children have remained with the defendant since 10 May 1990. This OS was not taken out by the plaintiff until 29 January 1991 and it was not served until 8 May 1991. I should also add that while the parties were living together, the two children were cared for mainly by the maternal grandmother.
On 2 June 1990 there was an altercation at the house of the defendant which led to an application by the plaintiff for a Summons for a Personal Protection Order against the defendant. The summons was later withdrawn on the advice of the learned magistrate.
From the welfare report it would appear that the couples' separation was apparently due to the fact that the defendant had lent their car to a friend without the plaintiff's knowledge, when she needed the car. The defendant asked her to take a taxi. She said that she was very angry with his inconsiderate attitude. I had no doubt that there must have been considerable friction between them prior to that event. The car incident might well be the proverbial ""last straw"".
The plaintiff's parents' home is a four-room HDB flat (three bedrooms and a sitting room) at Serangoon Ave 4. The plaintiff and her youngest sister (unmarried) share a room. Her eldest brother and her father occupy one room. Her mother and another sister's child occupy the third room. The flat is quite congested though well maintained. There would appear to be no or limited room available for the two children. While it is true that she could, if she was given custody of the two children, apply for an HDB flat for herself and her children to live, the problem then would be that there would be no adult in the home when the plaintiff goes to work, unless some other arrangements are made.
The home condition of the defendant's parents is better. It is a two-storey semi-detached house with four bedrooms, a study room and a living room. The defendant and his two children occupy a room. The defendant's two unmarried brothers occupy a room each and the defendant's parents take the fourth room. Home environment is spacious and cosy.
Min Chuan, aged 10, appears to be a sensible boy. He indicated that he loves both parents but would choose to be with his father. Xiao Su, though younger (seven coming to eight at the time of interview) also expressed that she would like to stay with her father. Both the children relate well to paternal grandparents.
The welfare officer also had an opportunity to observe the children when their mother came to see them in school. They were quite happy with her. But there are indications that they also fear her. That may be a reason why they prefer to live with their father, the defendant.
Case law would appear to suggest that in respect of very young children, everything being equal, there is a tendency on the part of the court to lean in favour of granting custody to the mother - see Re B (an infant) < 1962 > 1 All ER 872; Koh Teng Lam v Elsie Koh Chen Chee and anor < 1976 > 1 MLJ 103 at 117; Kades v Kades < 1961-2 > 3 AJLR 251; Shanta Kumari v Vijayan < 1986 > 2 MLJ 216; and Re W (a minor) < 1983 >4 FLR 16. But it is clear that we are not here dealing with very young children. On the date when I made the order the son was ten years' old and the girl was coming to be eight. They need parental guidance but certainly not of the sort of care which a todler will require and which a mother is better able to give. I think this passage of Evershed MR in Re B (an infant) (at p. 873) set out the position correctly:-
""For my part I do not believe that in those cases there is any such thing as a rule. Every case must plainly be determined on the particular circumstances affecting the case, though it is, of course, true to say that as a matter of human sense a young child is better with its mother and needs a mother's care.""
In terms of care and concern for the children, it seems to me that there is very little to choose between the two parents. Each was obviously trying to paint a darker picture of the other. On this count I would treat them both as equal - equally concerned for the children. As regards care arrangement, I would say both sides are just as satisfactory. The plaintiff's mother is willing to care for the children when the plaintiff is at work. The defendant's parents are also happy to care for the two grandchildren. While some doubts were cast by the plaintiff whether the defendant's parents are in a healthy state to care for the children, this was not borne out by the welfare report.
While physical accommodation for the children is not necessarily an important consideration, it is nevertheless a consideration which the court is entitled to take into account in the overall assessment. On this score the balance is in favour of the father.
Next is the question of the wishes of the children. Their preference is unquestionably with the father. Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act requires the court, in determining custody, to regard the welfare of the child as the ""first and paramount consideration."" Section 119 of the Women's Charter also provides that in deciding the question of custody the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child but it goes on to say that, subject to that, the court shall have regard to the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to express an independant opinion. Though s. 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act does not refer to the wishes of the child, I think there cannot be any doubt that the court, even apart from s. 119 of the Women's Charter, is entitled to have regard to that.
Having weighed all the relevant factors and bearing in mind that the paramount consideration is the welfare of the children, and here I should like to add that I was conscious that ""paramount"" does not mean exclusive: see Re L (infants) < 1962 > 3 All ER 1, I felt that the scale tilted in favour of the defendant and decided that the father should have custody of the children. The children are clearly happy where they are and there is nothing to indicate that the father is unsuitable to care for them or that insufficient care arrangements have been made for them. They want to remain there. They have care, comfort and attention. The father seems to be giving them the security they need. The children had stayed with their father for almost a complete year before the OS herein, taken out earlier, was served on their father. In my judgment it would be in their best interest to remain where they are. I did not think there was anything to warrant moving them. Indeed, in my view, it might be contrary to their well-being to make any change. I am glad to note no one has suggested that the two children should be separated.
As the children are schooling, access would necessarily have to be over the weekend. Thus, I ordered that the plaintiff shall have weekly access to the children between 5.00pm, Saturday and 5.00pm, Sunday. I also ordered that she should have additional access during the school vacations as indicated earlier.",1992-01-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
In this action the plaintiffs claimed against the defendants for losses and damages suffered by them arising from the structural damage caused to a stretch of the sewer mains at the Marina Centre which the plaintiffs had constructed for the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of the Environment (""MOE""). The plaintiffs alleged that the damage to the sewer pipe was attributed to the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents in carrying out drainage works in the vicinity. At the hearing of this action, the parties agreed that I should deal with the issue of liability first with damages to be assessed separately.
The facts are as follows. As long ago as 9 December 1980, the plaintiffs were awarded a contract by the Sewerage Department of (""MOE"") to supply and lay 1,238 metres of 600 mm diameter thickwall reinforced concrete (""R.C."") pipes and 296 metres of 375 mm thickwall R.C. pipes for the sewer mains from the Marina Centre to Beach Road. The plaintiffs commenced their works in December 1980.
On 14 January 1981 the defendants were awarded a contract by the Drainage Department of MOE for the supply and laying of box culverts running alongside portions of Nicoll Highway from Marina Centre to the start of Merdeka Bridge. The entire drainage works were sublet by the defendants to Lai Seng Engineering Contractors Pte Ltd (""LSE""). LSE completed the work of clearing the site of trees and saplings on 17 March 1981. Thereafter LSE commenced the excavation of their drainage trench by the open cut method. The sewer mains between MH 34 to 35 ran parallel to the drainage system.
In or about April 1981, when the plaintiffs had already completed the excavations for the sewer line, the timber formwork for the sewer trench for the stretch of the sewer line from MH 34 to MH 35 tilted. At the site meeting held on 4 May 1981, it was agreed between the Sewerage Department and the Drainage Department of the MOE, the plaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants would stop work from 4 May 1981 in order to allow the plaintiffs to complete their sewer line. On 29 June 1981 an agreement was reached between the parties whereby a sum of $30,000.00 was to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs for the damage to the trenchworks without any admission of liability and it was further agreed that the plaintiffs would proceed with their laying of sewer pipes and the defendants would commence their work only after the plaintiffs had completed their work.
The defendants backfilled their drainage excavation to enable the plaintiffs to repair their timber formwork and to complete their sewer line between MH 34 and MH 35. Repairs were carried out to the plaintiffs' timber formwork and the plaintiffs proceeded to complete their work of laying the sewer line. The plaintiffs completed their sewer line from MH 34 to 35 to 36 in November 1981 and the defendants recommenced their work after the plaintiffs completed their work of laying the sewer pipe for this stretch of the sewer line.
A series of joint surveys were carried out to the completed sewer line between MH 34 and MH 35 by the representatives of the plaintiffs and the defendants on 19 and 27 November 1981 and on 1 December 1981 to determine the levels of the pipe laid between MH 34 and MH 35 and to check the alignment of the sewer line. The alignment of the sewer line between MH 34 to MH 35 was found to be satisfactory.
At an inspection that was carried out on 30 June 1982 by the MOE, the sewer line from MH 34 to 35 was found to be badly misaligned.
The plaintiffs' cause of action as pleaded in paragraph 11 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim states: 
""11 The defendants so negligently carried out their said excavation works that they damaged the plaintiffs' adjacent sewer line construction by causing the same to go badly out of alignment.
PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE
(1) Failing to take steps to stabilise the sides of the defendants' excavation by means of proper timbering works.
(2) Failing to provide any or adequate timber lining to the said excavation.
(3) Failing to provide proper strutting to the defendants' drain excavation.
(4) Causing or permitting the unchecked movement of earth in the vicinity of the said excavation.
(5) Failing to provide and/or adhere to any or adequate drawings/designs for the said excavation works.
(6) In the circumstances, adopting the wrong constructional techniques in the excavation for the drain construction."".
The defendants in paragraph 6 of their Defence states: 
""6. As to paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Statement of Claim, the defendants deny that the work carried out by them subsequent to 1 December 1981 caused the damage to the plaintiffs' sewer line.
THE ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT 
The issues in this action are as follows: (1) Did the defendants owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs? (2) If so, what is the standard of care and scope of the duty by which I am to decide whether there is a breach of duty? (3) Have the defendants failed to show the requisite care that is required of them? (4) Did the breach cause damage to the plaintiffs' sewer line? (5) Was the damage caused to the plaintiffs' sewer line foreseeable?
In the written submission handed in by the defendants' counsel, the defendants's first submission is that the plaintiffs must establish that the defendants had adopted the wrong techniques in the construction of the drain. Next, it was submitted by the defendants that ""the damage < to the sewer line > was not caused by the defendants' activity and that even if it was, such damage was not foreseeable"". It was further submitted that this is a case of inevitable accident, namely, that if an event could not be foreseen and if the person allegedly responsible for causing an event to take place could not reasonably foresee that harm would result, then the event is an inevitable accident.
In Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co. (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784 Alderson B defined negligence as: ""the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct human his affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent or reasonable man would not do."".
In my judgment, the plaintiffs and the defendants were carrying out construction works in such close proximity to each other that the defendants owe a duty to the plaintiffs to take care in the conduct of his affairs, in that he ought reasonably to have forseen that if he did not take such care, damage would occur to the plaintiffs' works. The report of Messrs Toplis and Harding (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Exhibit P1), who were engaged to carry out a survey of the damage caused to the plaintiffs' timber formwork for the sewerage trench in April 1981, states that ""the line of excavation carried out by N. C. Senan < the defendants > is about 5 metres from your < the plaintiffs' > trench"". Furthermore the drain that was constructed by the defendants was 3.5 metres wide. The sewer trench of the plaintiffs for the entire length of the sewer line was of a depth of about 5 metres and about 1.7 metres wide.
I shall now consider the question whether there is a breach of the duty and, if so, whether the breach caused the damage and whether the damage is too remote. In order to do that I have to deal with the evidence and the question as to what had caused the damage to the sewer line between MH 34 to MH 35. 
The plaintiffs rely on the evidence of their expert witness, Mr Fong Weng Cheong, a professional engineer, who is a partner in a firm of civil engineers. He is a qualified civil and structural engineer. In 1963 he graduated from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, with a degree in civil engineering. He obtained a Master Degree in structures in Aberdeen University in 1965. He became a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK, the Institution of Structural Engineers, UK, the Institute of Highway and Transport (UK) and the Institution of Engineers, Singapore. He is a member of the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia, the American Society of Civil Engineers and the British Institute of Management. He is registered as an accredited checker with the Building Control Division of Singapore. He had been an examiner for the Institute of Engineers, Singapore and the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK.
Since his graduation in UK as a structural engineer he worked with Mott Hay Anderson. After that he worked with the Department of Highway, Ontario, Canada as a structural engineer, He had been registered as a professional engineer in Ontario. Thereafter he worked in Singapore with the Public Works Department (Roads) as a civil engineer. Later he joined K T Philcox, a firm of consulting engineers. Thereafter he became an associate of Tahil, Wong & Partners. He then joined Chan Chee Wah Maunsell & Partners. Thereafter he joined CME as Chief Engineer. Then he started his own partnership. 
Mr. Fong was the Consulting Engineer for the plaintiffs in respect of the Marina City sewerage project. Part of the plaintiffs' obligations under their sewerage contract with the MOE is to submit trench shoring calculations (""TS calculation"") for the latter's approval. Mr Fong prepared the TS calculations on behalf of the plaintiffs and they were approved by the MOE.
When he designed his calculations for the timber shoring for the plaintiffs' trench, Mr Fong said he had to know the subsoil conditions in that area in order to predict the lateral forces that will be acting inwards towards the site of the plaintiffs' trench. From the soil investigation results furnished by MOE, he said that the soil consists of a topfill of 5 metres or thereabouts and the immediate underlying soft submarine clay of 12 metres or thereabouts. In his opinion, a proper trench strutting system to transfer the lateral forces from one face of the trench to the opposite face of the trench would be necessary for such soil conditions. A mere cantilever supplied by timber planks or runners would result in the significant inward movement of the planks and the acting soil due to the depth of the excavation and the relatively low sheer strength of the supporting soil.
He told the Court that he made regular site visits during the progress of the sewer line works. In one of his earlier visits he observed that there was already gross distortion to the Plaintiffs' trench. Being an engineer, he had to find what was the cause of the gross distortion to the trench. He noticed that the defendants' excavations were in close proximity to the plaintiffs' sewer line trench. Because of the depth of the excavation of fill, which is relatively weak soil, he was of the view that the defendants' excavation without a proper strutting system would affect the soil in the immediate vicinity. He then requested the plaintiffs' representative on site to inform the defendants to take the necessary measures to counter-act any possible significant movements towards the plaintiffs' trench. Mr Fong also said that he had observed on site that there were collapses of soil resulting from the face of the defendants' excavations.
In his examination in chief, Mr Fong referred to a report which was prepared by him on the structural damage to the sewer at manholes MH 34 and MH 35 (""the Technical Report"") for the plaintiffs. The Technical Report was submitted to the plaintiffs on 30 August 1982 subsequent to the discovery by MOE of the misalignment of the stretch of the sewer line from MH 34 to 35. This report pertains to both the first incident and the second incident.
In page 5 of his report Mr Fong gave the following reasons for the damage to the timber formwork for the first incident: ""In the course of excavation for the drain, disturbance to the stratum of loose fill occurred in the vicinity of the excavation. In places where there is timbering at the drain excavation which was not properly strutted, the fill moved away from the sewer line timbering. Where no timbering was provided at the drain excavation the fill simply formed a natural batter between the drain excavation and the sewer line timbering, in the course of which the fill within this location is disturbed. In both cases the lateral earth pressure on the sewer line timbering nearer the drain excavation was decreased. But the lateral earth pressure on the sewer line timbering on the opposite side of the trench remained the same. Hence there was an out of balance force tending to push the sewer line timbering towards the open cut excavation at the drain.
In conjunction with the movement stated in the previous paragraph, the very soft marine clay at the bottom of the sloping or loosened fill started to flow towards the drain excavation. Hence the sewer line timbering moved towards the drain excavation with the top of the timber members tilting away from the drain excavation."".
In Mr Fong's opinion, the damage to the sewer line MH 34 to 35 was caused by the improper construction techniques employed by the Defendants in their drainage excavations. By using the term ""improper construction techniques"", Mr Fong explained that he was expressing an opinion. When a contractor carries out an open cut excavation there will be lateral forces acting towards the trench. These forces have to be contained by temporary works to stabilise the mass of earth moving towards the trench. In the Technical Report, Mr Fong said the defendants failed to take the necessary measures to counter-act any possible significant movements towards their trench. He was of the opinion that the defendants failed to take adequate measures to stabilise the sides of the drainage trench excavation.
In page 6 of his report, Mr Fong gave the following explanation for the structural damage to the sewer line between MH 34 and 35: ""On completion of the laying of the sewer pipes and the backfilling to the trench, the timbering was removed. All gaps left by the timber members were filled by compacted soil in order to restore the fill to its original density.
When the excavation was carried out at the adjacent drain, with little or no precautions taken to stabilise the sides of the excavation, lateral confinement to the 5 metres of fill was removed. This action initiated and caused the 5 metre fill to slide on top of the very soft marine clay towards the area of least resistance, i.e. at the open cut excavation of the drain. The lateral movement of the fill would displace the completed sewer pipe in a lateral direction following the direction of the movement of the fill. At a certain stage equilibrium was reached when the soil stabilised and the displaced pipe line movement would cease. The amount of lateral displacement is dependent of the amount of the fill displacement. If there is no displacement of fill, no displacement of the pipe line is anticipated. Hence the displacement of the pipeline will take up the shape of approximately a single curve beginning at the start of the adjacent excavation and ending where the excavation ceased."".
Mr Choo Gee Peng, who was employed as a works supervisor by the defendants in 1981 gave evidence before this Court. His testimony was that after the plaintiffs had completed their sewerage works, the defendants recommenced their works. His evidence, inter alia, in his own words is as follows: ""When I commenced work the second time, the sewerage works except for certain portions had been completed. That stretch of the sewer line near where we recommenced our work have been completed.
For our drainage works we used the open and cut method. Timbering was used on certain portions of the trench only. For our worksite we used 8"" by 3"" timbering to toe-in the side of the trench. We had timbering only on one side of the trench. It was on the side nearer the sewer line.
The reason for using timbering on certain portions of the trench is because the other portions of the soil are good. No timbering is required when the soil is good. We wanted to save on costs. We then proceeded on our drainage trench using the cut and open method. We completed the digging in order to lay the drains."".
Mr Bobby Ho gave evidence on behalf of the defendants as an expert witness. He is the Managing Director of Executive Decisions Inc Pte Ltd (""EDI""). He is also a professional engineer. His academic and professional qualifications are as follows: (a) Diploma from Brighton Technical College (1960); (b) Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers, UK, (1976); (c) Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Singapore, (1976) (d) Fellow of the Institution of Engineers, Malaysia (1977); (e) Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (1977); (f) Professional Engineer, Singapore (1971); (g) Professional Engineer, Malaysia (1972); (h) Member of the Institution of Builders, London (1978); (i) Fellow of the Society of Professional Engineers, Papua New Guinea (1980); (j) Affiliate of The Institution of Fire Engineers (1977); (k) Member of The Concrete Society (1975); (l) Member of British Tunnelling Society (1975); (m) Member of International Institute of Risk and Safety Management (1986) (n) Examiner, Institution of Civil Engineers, UK. (o) Examiner, Institution of Engineers, Singapore.
Mr. Ho gave the following description of his work experience: ""From August 1960 to December 1962 I was an assistant engineer with Sir William Halcrow & Partners of London. From January 1963 to December 1964, I was the site engineer employed by Higgs & Hills Ltd of London. During this period, I supervised the building of a section of the M4 motorway. This section involved the construction of three concrete bridges, six subways, culverts and connecting roadways. I also supervised the construction of the Euston Road underpass in London.
From March 1965 to December 1966 I was the engineer employed in design supervision in the Malaysian firm of Binnie & Partners. From January 1967 to May 1969 I was employed as Deputy Agent for the construction of the Seletar Dam in Singapore by Seacon-Lian Hup Han Joint Venture.
From April 1969 to October 1972 I was a project engineer with Gammon (Singapore) Sdn Bhd. I had been involved during this period with the construction of flyovers, wharves, slipways and piling operations.
From November 1972 till now I had been the managing director of Executive Decisions Inc. Pte. Ltd (`EDI'). My company deals with civil and structural engineering consultancy. I have had extensive civil and structural engineering experience. I am a member of the British Tunnelling Society. I have experience in tunnelling work. I have given evidence in our courts previously as an expert witness."".
His evidence is that he was consulted by the defendants on the drainage works they had carried out at Marina Centre during 1981 and 1982 after the occurrence of the first incident. When he visited the trenchworks for the sewer line, the plaintiffs' trench had already been backfilled. He said he was instrumental in 1981 in negotiating a settlement between the defendants' insurance company together with the defendants on a monetary compensation to be paid to the plaintiffs. He only visited the site once.
Subsequent to that, the insurance company of the defendants contacted him at a much later date on another claim made by the plaintiffs between the similar stretch of manhole (MH34 and 35). He requested the insurance company to obtain relevant information from the defendants so that he could look into the matter why the sewers which have been completed between MH34 and 35 was damaged. The defendants did not supply to the insurance company any of the information requested by him and his appointment died a natural death.
Subsequently, at a very much later date (i.e. two years before the hearing of this action), he was requested by the defendants to help out on a court action brought by the plaintiffs. He then requested for information similar to those he requested earlier. This was supplied through the sub-contractor of the defendants. After much discussion and many meetings with the defendants' sub-contractor and the defendants, he was able to collect sufficient information to enable him to form his opinion which is contained in his report (Exhibit D1). Mr Ho made it clear that his report was prepared on the basis of information supplied to him by the defendants.
At page 10 of his report, Mr Ho states: ""4. OPINION
4.1 As informed to us, the present claim was for the damage caused in horizontal displacement of the laid 600 mm diameter thickwall reinforced concrete sewer pipe for approximately 80 metres upstream of MH 35.
4.2 According to the report from the inspection carried out by the Sewerage Department, the displacement in alignment of the completed sewer pipe was badly affected. It is unfortunate that the amount of displacement could not be established or was recorded and whether any vertical displacement took place.
4.3 We therefore carried out calculations to establish the type of failures that could occur and this could be categorised under two headings < i.e. (i) failure due to upheaval and (ii) failure due to slip circle > viz:
a) checking of the factor of safety (F.O.S) against the upheaval of the excavated drainage base; and
b) check on the factor of safety against a slip-circle failure.
............. "".
On page 8 of his report, Mr. Ho states: ""3. DESCRIPTION OF WORKS
3.1 During the latter (sic) period of October 89, discussions were conducted with Mr Choo Gee Peng (hereinafter referred to as CGP) of LSE to provide a brief description of the works carried out by NCS < i.e. the defendants > . The final information requested from NCS was handed over to EDI on 29 September 89 in the form of Drawing No ENV/SEW/MC/5B representing the plan details and longitudinal section of the laid sewer line.
3.2 It was confirmed that the damage sustained to the damaged sewers was upstream of MH 35 for an approximate 80 m. in a lateral direction. However CGP was not able to confirm in which lateral direction the sewer pipe had moved nor whether there was any vertical displacements.
3.3 The method of work employed by LSE in the construction of the drain was by pure open cut method in the area concerned.
3.4 By arrangement mutually agreed between the Sewerage Department, < the > Drainage Department and both contractors, EHC was allowed to complete the laying of the sewer works whereby LSE then continued with the drainage works.
3.5 As the works method employed by LSE was by pure open cut through the use of a dragline in the form of a 19RB excavator, the 19RB excavator was sited astride the trench excavations works.
3.6 The centre line between the box culvert and sewer line was 8 m apart.
3.7 Due to the method of excavation and close proximity of both works, the dragline was virtually siting on top of the completed sewer line with the excavated material dumped and stockpiled to the rear of the machine in heaps with gaps in between for access to the area of the works (see Appendix C and D).
3.8 Soil report which was primarily carried out during the period for the first claim fortunately was still available and from the geotechnical reports carried out, EDI was able to carry out calculations pertaining to the ground conditions during the time of the construction of the box culvert by LSE.
3.9 As can be seen from Appendix C, the dragline excavator would be sitting directly above the sewer line with the excavated earth placed behind the machine.
3.10 Of relevance at that point of time was a letter, ref: ENV/DRA/2/81 dated 29 September 81 written by the Engineers of the Drainage Department that a section of the bottom of the excavation carried out by LSE had upheaved. This is great relevance to the fact that there was in effect ground movement at the time of constructing the drainage works.
3.11 Different sets of calculations were then carried out for different conditions pertaining to the safety and stability of the area of < the > works and these are all further expressed in our opinions."".
Mr Ho's hypothesis is that the misalignment of the sewer line may be caused by the weight that was brought to bear on the sewer line by the load that was placed on the side of the sewer trench that has already been backfilled. He attributed the misalignment of the sewer line to an earth slip that has taken place. In page 16 of his report, Mr Ho states: ""5. Conclusion
5.1 From our calculations, it can be shown that local upheavals in the excavated drainage works has occurred when the excavating machine was sitting directly above the slope of the excavated surface. This, however, would not have caused any damage to the sewer pipe as the upheaval of soil was in a vertical direction.
5.2 The damage caused to the sewer line has been occasioned from the stockpile of excavated earth on site. The slip-circle failure would have developed when the machine moved away from the excavated works especially at night, stoppages of work or when other works are in progress. Fortunately, the factor of safety lies within the marginal band for slip-circle failures to develop in most cases but when the machine and other constructional plant are parked beside the stockpiled earth, a full slip-circle failure will result in horizontal movement of earth towards the excavated face, thereby displacing the sewer pipe in a horizontal direction."".
The question which arises is: were the defendants acting reasonably in adopting the open and cut method of excavation? Mr Bobby Ho is of the opinion that they were. In his examination in chief, Mr Ho said: ""The open cut method is the normal method adopted by drainage contractors for the depth concerned and for the Marina area where the defendants were working. It would be the normal way of carrying out drainage works.
From the information available to me, the method adopted by the contractor is reasonable if it is viewed during the tender stage from the tender drawings supplied to him and the conditions on site which were known to him. After he has moved onto the site and found out that there was another contractor working astride him at eight metres and digging a trench deeper than his, the status of his tender changes because the site conditions are now different. He hasn't got the opportunity to change his Bill of Quantities because he is not allowed to do so contractually. He has to construct it in accordance with what is laid out in the contract drawings. From my own perusal of the contract documents, it would not be possible for the defendants to know that there was another contractor astride at eight metres away, if it is not shown in the drawings. The sewerage works were not shown in the defendants' contract drawings given by the Drainage Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
.............
I was aware of the first incident where the trenchwork of the plaintiffs was tilted. I assisted in the negotiations of the parties whereby the plaintiffs' claim against the defendants was settled. ... Arising from these negotiations, I was told later on that the defendants had to wait for the plaintiffs to complete their sewer line before proceeding with their work. During the discussions, I did recommend that the sewer line should be completed before the defendants' work was completed. When the sewer line works were completed, the sewerage trench would be backfilled. The defendants' contractor was on an open site. It would be logical for him to carry out his digging works by the open cut method. Under those circumstances it would be reasonable for the defendants to carry out works in the way they had but one has to bear in mind the experience of the contractors in carrying out the works. I mean that if the contractor had fully qualified and experienced personnel on site who are familiar with ground conditions (i e soft ground), he might change his method of work and use other methods besides the open and method. In this case, it is my opinion that even if he had an experienced engineer on site and considering the depth of excavation of his drainage trench, he would still recommend an open cut method because of the depth which is considered not deep. One has to bear in mind when considering excavations to relate the depth of an excavation with its width. In particular, we should not confuse the trench excavated by the sewerage contractors which is a deep and narrow in width trench. The trench by the sewerage contractor being narrow in width has to be supported on its vertical sides otherwise it would collapse without any doubt. The trench which is excavated by the drainage contractor is considered shallower, firstly because of its depth in terms of figure and secondly in consideration of its depth against its width. The width is more than twice its depth. The width of the drainage trench is more than twice its depth. The risk of the sides collapsing need not necessarily depend on the width in relation to depth but it also depends on the soil condition particularly on the stability of the slope.
For the present contract of the defendants, there was no soil investigation report. The Drawing Department when calling for tenders for drainage works of such nature normally do not supply soil investigation reports. They have supplied soil investigation reports for large drainage contracts worth more than $10 million.
From what I heard from DW1's evidence, he carried out timber protection works on certain portions of the trench on the side nearer the sewer works. Apparently he did not carry out timber protection works over the entire length. I believe he did this because he had timber protection works to protect the slope of his excavation at areas which were slipping. He mentioned that where the slope at other areas was good, there was no protective measure. DW1 would be right in doing what he had done when he considers only his own works."". (Emphasis added by me.)
Although Mr Ho's opinion is that the method of excavation adopted by the contractor is reasonable, he made it clear that his opinion was subject to certain qualifications which have been reproduced in italics.
It was submitted by the plaintiffs' counsel that the defendants as builders have a duty to investigate and examine the land before they build on it and the extent of that duty was to be determined by what a careful and competent builder would have done in the circumstances. In support of their contention, the plaintiffs' counsel referred to paragraph 8-39 at page 577 of Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence, 8th Edition and to the case of Batty v. Metropolitan Property Realisations Ltd < 1978 > Q.B. 554. Paragraph 8-39 of Charlesworth & Percy on Negligence 8th Edition at page 577 states: ""The extent of a builder's duty to investigate and examine land, before they build on it, was to be determined by what a careful and competent builder would have done in the circumstances. Such duty was not restricted merely to observable defects on land, owned by them or to which they had a legal right of entry, if a careful and competent builder would have observed defects on neighbouring land and would not have built until either there had been further investigation of the site, together with the adjoining land, or he had received a satisfactory report from an expert on the condition of the subsoil"".
In my judgment the defendants had not acted reasonably in the circumstances of this case by adopting the open cut method of excavation for the drainage trench. They merely did what they thought were logical. They were only concerned with the safety of their own works. They were interested in saving costs. If the defendants had acted in a manner which a careful builder would have done in the circumstances of this case, they would not have in my view carried on with the open and cut method of excavating the drainage trench after they had entered onto the site and discovered a deep sewer trench next to their proposed drainage works without having carried out an investigation of the soil conditions or sought the advice of a professional engineer on the progress of their works. If not, a careful builder would have done so after the occurence of the first incident. Mr Choo who was supervising the works acknowledged that the works of the plaintiffs and the defendants were so close that they would cause problems. Mr Choo confirmed that the defendants did not carry out any tests for the soil conditions. In his examination in chief, he said that if he was aware of the peculiar conditions of the soil he would have adopted other methods of digging the drainage trench.
The defendants did not engage any consulting engineer to advise them on the drainage excavations. Mr Bobby Ho said he was called in to assist the defendants on the claim made by the plaintiffs in respect of the first incident. Mr Ho said he visited the site once and that he was instrumental in negotiating a settlement between the defendants and the plaintiffs. In cross- examination, Mr Ho made it clear that he was not the defendants' consulting engineer and he was never engaged to design any temporary works for the defendants. It was not disputed by Mr Ho that had the defendants done better trench works as the plaintiffs had done, the second incident would not have happened.
Mr Choo in his cross-examination gave the following evidence: ""Q For this drainage trench, did you have any trench shoring calculations? A Not for this trench.
Q No expert came along and told you how to do timbering? A I recall that my site manager asked a professional engineer to come and look at the site.
Q What did the professional engineer do? A I cannot recall.
Q Was the toe-ing in your responsibility? A It was a joint effort with my site manager."".
During his re-examination, Mr Choo confirmed that the professional engineer who came to the site was Mr Bobby Ho.
What is the standard of care and the scope of the duty of the defendants? In my judgement it is the standard of care that is expected of them as careful and competent drainage contractors and not the standard that is expected of the defendants based on the type of personnel that they have in their organisation. Paragraph 10-59 in Chapter 10 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 16th Edition at page 490 states: Standard of a reasonable man. The standard normally set by law is that of a reasonable and prudent man. Negligence is a species of fault liability; ... The standard is objective, which means that no allowance is made for the `personal equation', which would take account of each individual's weakness, unless, in the first place, it is obvious or known that he is in some way abnormal, in which case his conduct is judged according to the persons that is expected from persons of that type; or secondly, in some emergency, which has been thrust upon a person, his weakness will be relevant in determining whether he acted reasonably. ...
... The standard of the reasonable man's conduct has been described as follows. `Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do; or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. ..."".
Did the defendants' breach of the duty of care cause the damage to the sewer line? Both Mr Fong and Mr Ho offered different theories on the cause for the structural damage to the sewer line. Mr Fong's opinion is that the damage to the sewer line was caused by the failure to maintain the structural integrity of the drainage trench and to safeguard against soil movement. Mr Ho's opinion is that the damage was occasioned by an earth slip that was brought about by the stockpile of earth on the site and the weight of the 19RB excavator. I prefer Mr Fong's version for a number of reasons. In Mr Ho's hypothesis, for the slip circle failure to take place there must be vehicles and a stockpile of earth of the aggregate weight of 50 tonnes on the site. The photographs in the Toplis and Harding report (Exhibit P1) which show the damaged timber formwork of the sewerage trench near MH 35 and the adjoining drainage trench do not show any stockpile of earth at all. When Mr Ho was asked during his cross-examination to offer an explanation for the first incident, he gave the following answers: ""Q During the first incident, the integrity of the sewerage trench was maintained by timber shoring and struts made according to Mr Fong's design. Nonetheless, upon the drainage works commencing the sewer formwork tilted? A Yes.
Q Assuming that the sewerage trench had not been dug, would there have been movement of soil when the drainage trench was excavated? A I have in my report stated the occasion in which a slip can occur. It is shown in page 13 of my report. Yes, there will be a slip depending on certain conditions.
Q I refer to PB11, the lower photo. Using your hypothesis, where did you reckon the RB19 was placed and where was the stockpile of earth? A I was not there when they were doing their work. The photo shows that the trench on the right hand side of the sewer line appeared to have been dug and abandoned. Either the drainage trench was dug first and the sewerage works was excavated or vice versa I can't say when.
Q If such is the case i.e. the RB19 was not located at left of the sewer formwork, what do you attribute the tilting of the formwork to? A I have not done any investigation on the causation of the first incident. I was purely a party in mediating a settlement terms.
Q You advised a settlement by payment to the plaintiffs? A Yes.
Q Why? A That is the quickest way to do a settlement.
Q Going back to the photo on PB11, in order to obtain the critical mass for a slip, there must be vehicles and stockpile of earth of the aggregate weight of 50 tonnes? A Yes.
Q And if such slip occurs, the top of the formwork will tilt away from the drainage trench? A Yes.
Q If there was no vehicle or stockpile giving that critical mass of 50 tonnes then your hypothesis will not explain the tilting shown in the photos of the first incident. A My report has nothing to do with the first incident. It considers the conditions existing for the second incident.
Q What are those conditions? A The sewer has been laid, the backfill has been carried, timber runners have been removed and the ground has been returned to its original state."".
Mr Ho accepted Mr Fong's opinion that the earth from the drainage trench moved towards the sewerage trench as regards the first incident. Mr Ho's testimony on the this point during his cross-examination is as follows: ""Q Would you agree that the earth at the bottom of the drainage trench after digging would have destabilized? A What do you mean by ""destabilized""?
Q. (1) There is loosening of soil. (2) The weight of excavated earth is not there. Correct? A The second one is correct. The loosening is confined to the very top layer (i.e. formation level) where the excavation is carried out.
Q The difference between the bottom of the sewerage trench and the drainage trench would be 1.15 m? A Yes.
Q In Appendix C to the soil report in Exhibit D1, you agree that Mr Fong's theory is correct? A I can't answer the question until you qualify that.
Q Would you agree with Mr Fong that notwithstanding the depth differential between the sewerage trench and the drainage trench and given the fact that - (a) the differential at the most was 1.15 m; (b) there was a stress relief in that the mass of the excavated earth no longer was acting? on the bottom of the drainage trench; (c) the bottom of the drainage trench varied by a depth of 0.25 m to 1.25 m was resting on very soft marine clay for the fact that the sewerage trench timber work tilted at the top away from the drainage trench, the ground at the bottom of the sewerage trench had moved forwards the drainage trench? A I don't disagree with any of the points except for one. That is the different depth between the two structures. In my disagreement, the movement of earth would have affected only up to the formation level of the drainage excavation works. The tilting in the case of the first incident which is not the subject of the claim here, I agree can tilt away from the drainage excavation. What I would like to bring out is that the question posed to me is addressed to the first incident which I have not addressed in my report.
Q You are in no position to quarrel with Mr Fong's opinion that the earth from the sewerage trench moved towards the drainage trench notwithstanding the depth differential? A I have no quarrel so long as it is confined to the first incident."".
In my judgment the model behaviour explained by Mr Fong as regards the first incident is likely to hold true for the second incident. Mr Fong was familiar with the site. He had seen the sewerage trench and designed the timber formwork. Mr Ho only visited the site once and his hypothesis is based on information which were fed to him and he has never seen how the defendants carried out the excavations for the drainage trench either before or after the first incident.
Was the damage to the sewer line between MH 34 and 35 forseeable by the defendants? The defendants' counsel submitted that the damage was not forseeable. I have no hesistation in coming to the conclusion that it was. The first incident had resulted in damage to the timber formwork to the sewerage trench and also caused misalingnment to the sewer pipe that was already laid. The sewer pipe was laid on a foundation that is supported by tanalised wooden piles. After they were laid, their alignment will be checked and if it is satisfactory the pipe will be haunched according to specifications. Later the timber formwork will be removed and the trench backfilled with sand on both sides to a certain level and then backfilled with soil. Mr Fong's evidence is that if there is any lateral movement of the soil that resulted from a force acting on the face of the drainage trench excavated by the defendants, it will lead to horizontal movements of the sewer line and that will cause the pipe to be misaligned. In my view the damage in this case is not of the kind that is not forseeable as in the Wagon Mound case < 1961 > A.C. 388. I have also considered the point made by Mr Ho that if there is poor compaction of the backfill to the sewerage trench, it might cause the misalignment. There is no evidence before me that the compaction of the backfill was not carried properly to the satisfaction of the staff of the Sewerage Department of MOE. Mr Fong's opinion is that poor compaction, if any, would not cause any horizontal displacement of the sewer pipe. After the sewer pipe is supported by piles and the subsidence, if any, would be counteracted by the piles. I accept Mr Fong's explanation.
In his written submission counsel for the defendant referred me to the case of Singapore Finance Ltd v. Lim Kah Ngam (S) Pte Ltd and Eugene H L Chan Associates (Third Party) < 1984 > 2 MLJ 202 which he described as the leading local authority on the tort of negligence relating to building activity which causes subsidence or damages to an adjoining property. In the said case the defendants had constructed a coffer dam but as a result of de-watering of the site, an adjoining building had developed cracks. The owners of the building sued the defendants. The court held that the common law principle in Acton v. Blundell (1843) 152 E.R 1223 applied in Singapore, namely, the owner of the soil is entitled to all that lies beneath the surface; that the person who owns the soil may dig therein and apply all that is there found to his own purposes at his free will and pleasure; and if in the exercise of such right he intercepts or drains off the water collected from underground springs in his neighbour's well, this inconvenience to the neighbour falls within the description of damnum absque injuria, which cannot become the ground of an action. I do not think that case is of any assistance to us. In that case the owners of the adjoining land sued the owners of the land on which the building activity was carried out. In our present case, the plaintiffs were contractors who constructed sewer mains on State land and the defendants were contractors constructed drains on State land. Both contractors were carrying out works for the Ministry of the Environment!
Accordingly for the reasons given above, I hold that the defendants are wholly liable to the plaintiffs for the damage caused to the stretch of the Marina Centre sewer mains from MH 34 to 35. I give interlocutory judgment for the plaintiffs with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. The plaintiffs will be entitled to their taxed costs.",1992-01-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
On 16 March 1992, the 2nd accused pleaded guilty before me to the following charge:
That you, Raja s/o Ramo, on or about the 8th day of August 1989 between 1.00 p.m. and 3.00 p.m. at Changi Point, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of all three of you, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam by means of an instrument, to wit, a police baton, which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death, when one of you used the police baton to strike the said Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam several times on his person and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 324 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The victim of injuries leading to the charge arising from events on 8 August 1989 was one Natha Kumar s/o Sahajanandam, a 15-year-old student at Deyi Secondary School. Three persons were charged with offences arising from the injuries sustained by him. All three were charged under s324 of the Penal Code with voluntarily causing hurt by means of an instrument which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death. One of the others was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s326 of the Penal Code. The third faced an additional charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s304(a) of the Penal Code.
Each pleaded guilty to the respective charges and was sentenced. The second accused, Raja s/o Ramo, now appeals against the sentence imposed on him.
Raja s/o Ramo, born on 13 December 1970, was 18 years and 7 months at the time of the offence. Together with the other two, the first accused, Ferosh Khan, aged 18 years and the third, Arjunan, aged 20 years, he worked as a security officer-cum-dog handler for a security
company. The three of them had a grievance against the victim, then aged 15, who was spotted by one of the three accused on the morning of the day in question. Each, for his own reason, wanted to confront the victim.
After the victim's denial of being involved in any of the incidents that the accused persons thought gave rise to their grievances, they asked him to meet them at the coffee shop. There, he was further confronted and pressed for the address of another person who the three accused believed was the main trouble maker in the incidents giving rise to their grievances. The victim agreed to do so, whereupon the three accused formed their intention to beat him up. At that time, Arjunan had a police baton carried hidden in a bag.
A lorry was borrowed from their employer by Arjunan who drove it to where the appellant and Ferosh were waiting with the victim. Before boarding the lorry, the appellant went looking for a weapon and, from his block of flats, brought a long rattan pole with him. They drove off in the lorry with the victim but he was not co-operative in revealing the address he said he would. The accused persons then drove around and the questioning of the victim continued.
During this time, the appellant kicked the victim and to all intents and purposes was the initiator of an act of violence on the victim. The lorry was then parked somewhere near Changi Point and all three accused persons assaulted the victim. The appellant also used the rattan pole to beat the victim, causing the injuries to his head. Throughout this incident, the victim did not retaliate. He hardly could have. He was left lying on the floor of the lorry, injured and bleeding from the head.
Arjunan then decided to return the lorry to its owner. Looking in the cabin for a cloth for the victim to wipe his bloodstains, the first accused (Ferosh) found one in which a parang was wrapped. He took both to the rear of the lorry and gave the cloth to the victim, leaving the parang on the floor of the lorry.
Arjunan was driving the lorry and the appellant and Ferosh were in the rear with the victim. When the lorry was being driven over a bumpy track, the victim got up suddenly. Ferosh, fearing the victim was going for the parang, grabbed it and slashed the victim on the back and side.
The appellant grabbed the parang from Ferosh and he claimed that whilst he was doing so, it accidentally hit the victim. The pathologist found three parang injuries on the victim. The cuts caused were respectively, (i) 11.5 x 5 cm, (ii) 10 x 3.5 cm and (iii) 6.7 x 3 cm. The last was superficial but it is difficult to believe that any one of the three was caused accidentally.
The lorry was stopped and in response to the victim scolding him when Arjunan apologised, Arjunan grabbed the parang and slashed the victim on his neck causing a gaping wound.
The victim was abandoned beside a dirt track to be discovered by chance only three days later.
In mitigation it was said that the appellant's father passed away when he was five. He has an elder brother and a younger sister. His mother works as a factory operative.
His sickly disposition was claimed to have impaired academic performance at school. He attended the Vocational & Industrial Training Board in 1986. He then worked as a welder and while awaiting National Service worked for a security company when the offence took place.
It was emphasised by his advocate that the appellant grabbed the parang from Ferosh to prevent further injury to the victim but while doing so, may have hit the victim again.
This I found difficult to believe. Even if I were to believe it, I must take into account the likelihood of injury when on a moving lorry a parang is snatched away by one from another.
While the appellant and Ferosh were earlier waiting with the victim for Arjunan to bring the lorry, upon its arrival the appellant went to his block of flats to look for a weapon. He found a long rattan pole he brought with him.
Having regard to the common intention which led to more serious charge against his fellow accused, the appellant must consider himself lucky that the charge against him was under s324.
In view of this, I thought the appropriate sentence was the maximum term of imprisonment under that section. The appellant saw fit to leave the others and go to his block of flats to get a rattan pole. As stated in the charge, he struck the victim with the police baton. He inflicted the first blows on the victim. In view of the appellant's use of the police baton to inflict injuries, I was also of the view that ten strokes of the cane was appropriate.",1992-09-07 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
On 22 May 1989 or thereabout, a group of companies owned and/or controlled by one William Goei sold some substantial properties at Goldhill Plaza (collectively called `Goldhill properties') to a group of companies owned and/or controlled by an Indonesian businessman, Lauw Siang Liong for a sum of approximately $93 millions and the sale was completed on 22 October 1989 or thereabout. Under the sale agreements, a commission in aggregate in the sum of $465,388.26 representing +% of the total purchase price was payable by the vendors to the defendant. The commission was paid to the defendant in full only in early March 1990 or thereabout. The plaintiff claimed that she was entitled to , of the commission amounting to $116,347 and on the defendant's refusal to pay this amount, she instituted this action against him claiming the sum of $116,347. The action was heard before me, and at the conclusion I found that the plaintiff had established her claim and I gave judgment to her in the sum of $116,347 with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment. I also awarded her the costs of the action. I now give my reasons.
By her statement of claim, the plaintiff averred that in April 1989 she became aware that the Goldhill properties were for sale and found a potential buyer but did not approach the vendors directly; she introduced the buyer to the defendant and requested the defendant to introduce the buyer to the vendor and the defendant did so and in consequence the buyer purchased the properties from the vendor. She further averred that it was a term of the sale that a commission at +% of the purchase price was to be paid to the defendant; that it was agreed between her and the defendant that she would be paid , of the commission received by the defendant, and that the commission was received by the defendant who refused to pay to her the share thereof as agreed.
The defence was one of denial of the plaintiff's claim. The defendant averred that the plaintiff became aware that the Goldhill properties were for sale from the plaintiff's associate, Lena Wong, and that it was Lena Wong who introduced the buyer to him. He admitted that the amount of the commission was $465,389 but denied that the plaintiff was entitled to any commission at all.
The pleadings of both the parties were quite inadequate as the evidence unfolded showed that a great deal of the material facts relied upon on by their counsel were not pleaded. Be that as it may, the issue before me was basically whether there was an oral agreement by the defendant express or implied to pay to the plaintiff , of the commission which he received from the sales of the Goldhill properties. The issue essentially involved my findings of fact on the evidence adduced. It is necessary to set out and deal with in some detail the evidence.
First, there was the evidence of the plaintiff which, so far as material, was this. She was and is an estate agent and the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties. In April 1989, she knew that the Goldhill properties were for sale; she heard of this through market rumours and from her associate, Lena Wong and one Tony Sim. She then got in touch with Lauw Siang Liong (`Lauw') who was in Indonesia and informed him that the properties were for sale and suggested that he should have a look at them. Lauw then came to Singapore and she showed him the properties in one evening. Lauw had been her long term client and most of the properties he purchased in Singapore were purchased through her. She did not approach William Goei directly, and could not do so, because her associate, Lena Wong, had previously bribed the property manager of the group of companies of William Goei. At that time, she and Lena Wong were sharing the same office in Tan Chong Tower at Queen's Street. She and Lena Wong discussed about the Goldhill properties and they decided to use the defendant to front for them. Arising from the discussion, Lena Wong spoke to the defendant who agreed to act as the front for them. The discussion as to the terms on which he would front for them was initially conducted through Lena Wong since she was the one who approached him. Subsequently, it was agreed that the commission should be divided into four equal shares: , for the defendant, , for Lena Wong, , for Tony Sim and , for the plaintiff herself. All of them agreed to this. Tony Sim was on friendly terms with William Goei and it was through him that they could arrange for a meeting between William Goei and Lauw. It was quite well known in the market that William Goei would not see any agent unless the agent was known to him. The defendant himself could not have met William Goei. Tony Sim was the one who arranged the meeting between William Goei, Lauw and the defendant.
The plaintiff testified in no uncertain terms that she introduced Lauw to the defendant and the introduction was made at the Sheraton Tower where Lauw was then staying. Lauw could not have used the defendant without her introduction. She said that she contacted Lauw first and that without her involvement, the transaction would not have been effected. Lauw would not have acted with Lena Wong without her involvement and the sharing of the commission was known to Lauw. She had shared commissions with Lena Wong in previous sales of properties to Lauw.
The plaintiff said that on the date of signing, she sent Lauw to UOB Building (the sale agreements were signed in the office of Khattar Wong & Partners in UOB Building) and she waited for him in her car by the roadside. After the agreements were signed, she sent Lauw back to the hotel. She, Lena Wong and the defendant went back to her office at Queen's Street and they were very happy. They decided to buy four jade necklaces to be presented to the Goddess of Mercy to thank her for the good fortune. The four were meant to be one for the defendant, one for Lena Wong, one for Tony Sim and one for the plaintiff herself and the presentation was to be made at the Waterloo Street temple. She did purchase the four jade necklaces.
The plaintiff further testified that at or about the time of the signing of the agreements, all the four parties agreed to share the commission equally. After the sale was completed, she made several attempts to call the defendant and Lena Wong but they refused to talk to her. By then the relationship between her and Lena Wong had already turned sour; there was a quarrel between her and Lena Wong in her office. Lena Wong subsequently moved out and took away all the files in her office. The defendant and Lena Wong subsequently wanted to reduce her share of the commission to 18%. She refused to accept it. She was quite emphatic in her evidence that Lauw would not have bought the Goldhill properties through the defendant or through Lena Wong. Lauw did not appear to give evidence. According to the plaintiff, he was at the time of the hearing ill and was in Hong Kong.
Next, there was the evidence of Ms Lam Siat Khevn (known as Mrs Eng), the financial controller of the group of companies owned and/or controlled by William Goei. She testified that she was instructed by William Goei to handle the payment of commission for the sale of the Goldhill properties and was told by him that Tony Sim should be given a share of the commission and the commission was +% of the total sale price. She saw the defendant and Tony Sim in her office on 13 October 1989 when she told them that Tony Sim was the agent the vendors recognised and that the commission would be split between the defendant and Tony Sim. They told her that she should make out to them the cheques for the commission on the basis of `50/50' and each party would take care of his partner. In response she said that as the contract was under the defendant's name, she asked the defendant to give a letter authorising the payment to Tony Sim, and that both of them were happy; she told the defendant that she would give him a draft to be signed by the defendant on his letterhead. Subsequently, Tony Sim called and informed her that his portion would be split between him and the plaintiff and gave her the plaintiff's name. Accordingly, she made out three cheques, one in favour of the defendant for 50% of the commission, one in favour of Tony Sim for 25% and the third cheque for the plaintiff for 25% of the commission. She telefaxed the draft letter to the defendant. Tony Sim and the defendant subsequently came to her office and the defendant said that he could not sign the letter because there were `tax implications'. Accordingly, she did not release the cheques to Tony Sim and the defendant as she insisted that the letter was to be signed. After that, they left her office. She said that the defendant knew that one cheque was prepared in favour of the plaintiff for 25% of the commission, and he did not object to the commission being split with Tony Sim.
Tony Sim also gave evidence, which, so far as material, was this. In early 1989, he knew that certain properties in Goldhill Plaza were for sale and this was told to him by William Goei himself. William Goei was a friend of his; he had known William Goe since 1979. William Goei told him that if anyone wanted to buy the properties, he could refer the purchaser to William Goei. Tony Sim knew the plaintiff and also knew Lena Wong as a partner of the plaintiff. He got to know them around 1989. He informed them that the properties were for sale and asked if there was any buyer, and Lena Wong told him that she had a potential buyer, an Indonesian man, and he followed that up with Lena Wong. At that time, there was no way William Goei would deal with Lena Wong because of her involvement in bribing the sale manager of William Goei's companies. Lena Wong suggested to him that he should introduced the defendant to William Goei as the front man. The plaintiff was also involved in the transaction. She was `in the thick of it together with Lena Wong'. The plaintiff knew the Indonesian buyer and was liaising with him together with Lena Wong.
Tony Sim said he brought the defendant to see William Goei first and thereafter he arranged for a meeting between the defendant, Lauw and William Goei. He played the part of an intermediary between William Goei on the one hand and plaintiff and Lauw on the other. He was aware that on successful completion of the transaction, there was a commission of +% of the total sale price payable. He said that the +% was to be shared between the defendant, Lena Wong, plaintiff and himself. He said that all three of them, namely, Lena Wong, plaintiff and the defendant, played a part and the plaintiff had an important role to play in the transaction. It was Lena Wong who initiated the sharing of the commission amoung the four of them. At that time, he was in Government service - he was then an officer of CPIB - and was not sure whether he should receive a commission. He expressed his doubt to William Goei who said that that was a proper transaction and no corruption was involved. The four of them were happy with the arrangement on the signing of the sale agreements. They even had a dinner at Swatow Restaurant to celebrate the signing.
In cross-examination, Tony Sim confirmed that he had instituted an action against the defendant to recover his share of the commission. He said that Lena Wong initiated the sharing of the commission among the four of them after the second meeting between William Goei, the buyer and the defendant and himself. He denied that William Goei had agreed to pay an additional +% commission to him and the plaintiff and that the plaintiff's share was for the credit of Lauw. It was suggested to him that the +% commission under the agreement was to be shared between the defendant and Lena Wong only, and to that he replied that Lena Wong was in the background and if she was entitled to it, so would all four of them, and there was no reason for the +% to be shared between Lena Wong and the defendant leaving him and the plaintiff out.
Tony Sim also confirmed that he gave the name of the plaintiff to Mrs Eng Siat Khevn and requested that in respect of his portion of the commission, one cheque should be made out in his name and the other in favour of the plaintiff. The cheques were made out but were not given because the defendant refused to sign the document requested by Mrs Eng. He was also cross-examined on his request to Mrs Eng to make out a cheque giving a share of the commission to the plaintiff. His answer for so doing was that he was afraid `that things like this happened and it really happened'.
The last witness for the plaintiff was Ong Chong Yam who was an employee of the plaintiff. His evidence was not very material and was based essentially on hearsay and was this. He said that he heard from the plaintiff and Lena Wong of the sale of the Goldhill properties to an Indonesian client. He was told that there were some problems in negotiating and that they had decided to ask the defendant to act as the middle man. He was told subsequently - he did not say by whom - that the commission would be shared equally between the four parties. He did say that on the day the agreements were signed the plaintiff, Lena Wong and the defendant came back to the office and that they purchased some jade necklaces through a friend of his called Yap Chi Wee. He also testified that he subsequently heard from Lena Wong that the plaintiff's share of the commission would be reduced.
The defendant himself gave evidence. He said that he knew the plaintiff. She was his sale assistant at Tong Eng Brothers Pte Ltd. Subsequently, the plaintiff set up her own firm called Queensfield Properties. Prior to the sale of the Goldhill properties, he had handled a sale with the plaintiff, and in that sale he was the purchaser and the property was a unit at the Golden Mile Complex. The plaintiff played a role in that sale and he paid her a commission. Beside that transaction, he said he had not handled any transaction with the plaintiff. In respect of two other transactions referred to by the plaintiff, he dealt with Lena Wong and not the plaintiff. He knew that Lena Wong was an associate of the plaintiff at the time. They shared the same office. He accepted that in respect of these two transactions he received the cheques for payment of his commissions from the plaintiff but he issued his invoices and his receipts to Lena Wong's firm, Kingsfield Properties.
The defendant said that he came to know that the Goldhill properties were for sale around May 1989. He was approached to be the agent for the sale of Goldhill properties by Lena Wong who told him that she had a buyer. On being so approached, he `sized her up' by introducing her a property, 53/55 New Bridge Road and arranged for a site meeting. The meeting was arranged on 15 May 1989 and he was introduced to Lauw at the site. Present there at the meeting were also the representative of the seller and the plaintiff. The buyer made an offer but the seller refused to sell. Immediately thereafter, they worked on the Goldhill properties. Lena Wong told him that as the sale of the Goldhill properties was a big transaction, it involved difficult negotiation and suggested that he should be the negotiator for the deal to which he agreed. He wanted to get in touch with William Goei but Lena Wong said that `things would be made easier' if Tony Sim was involved. Lena Wong told him that Tony Sim knew William Goei personally and that she would get Tony Sim to speak to William Goei to appoint the defendant as the agent for the sale. The defendant initially objected to Lena Wong using Tony Sim as it was not necessary and the Goldhill properties were in the open market. He subsequently relented because Lena Wong told him that it would not affect their deal or commission since Tony Sim did not want any money. He therefore agreed. That conversation took place at about the time when they were discussing the sale of New Bridge Road property and nobody was present except him and Lena Wong. Lena Wong then arranged for an appointment for him to see William Goei. That first meeting was only between him, Tony Sim and William Goei. He was brought there by Tony Sim. At that meeting, they discussed the value of the properties and also the commission payable. It was agreed that the commission should be 1%. After that meeting, he went to see Lauw and explained to him the Goldhill properties. Subsequently, through Tony Sim, a meeting was set up for William Goei to meet Lauw. On that occasion, he, Tony Sim and Lauw met William Goei. The meeting was on 16 May 1989. At that meeting, agreement was reached between William Goei and Lauw on the sale and purchase of the Goldhill properties.
The defendant said that after the completion of the sales, he was not paid the commission as agreed. He sent invoices to William Goei for payment. His commission was officially +%. After some events which happened before completion of the sale, Tony Sim wanted a share of the commission and so did the buyer. This was communicated to him through the plaintiff, and that was before the buyer made his decision to purchase the property. He had no choice but to agree, and Tony Sim again arranged for him to see William Goei. He saw William Goei again and it was then agreed that the +% was to be stated in the contract and the additional +% to be on `a gentleman's agreement'. William Goei specifically said that Tony Sim would collect the additional +% from him and the +% commission appearing on the sale and purchase agreement was specifically for the defendant. As Lena Wong was his co-broker, he would share the +% with Lena Wong. The other +% was to be shared between Tony Sim and the buyer. After the completion, he sent the requisite invoices for the commissions. But he received a letter from Goldhill Properties (Pte) Ltd stating that they only agreed to pay the +% commission as provided in the sale agreement. They went to the office of Goldhill Properties (Pte) Ltd and saw Mrs Eng and had a conversation with her. She wanted him to confirm in writing the authorisation for payment of the commission to Sim and plaintiff but he disagreed and refused to sign the letter because she refused to answer when the other +% commission would be forthcoming. He refused to give a letter stating full and final settlement of the commission. He subsequently sued for his +% commission and obtained summary judgment for the amount. He confirmed that he had not agreed at any stage to share the +% with the plaintiff; nor had he agreed to share any commission with Tony Sim.
He denied that the plaintiff was involved in any discussion relating to the transaction and said that she only appeared at lunch and dinner which Lauw hosted. He conceded that the plaintiff had a special relationship with Lauw who liked her and Lena Wong very much and that the plaintiff was closer to Lauw than Lena Wong.
Lena Wong gave evidence for the defendant and so far as material her evidence was this. She was and is the sole proprietress of Kingsfield Properties. She knew both the plaintiff and the defendant. She and the plaintiff were business associates and they shared the same office and the expenses. The plaintiff was the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties. There were times when they were co-brokers in transactions. She knew Lauw since mid-1988 and she was introduced to him by the plaintiff. Lauw had made purchases of properties through her. The first transaction was the sale of two units in Tanglin Park and one unit at Pinewood. She was the broker for the sale of these properties to Lauw. She said that the plaintiff had special relationship with Lauw; the plaintiff addressed him as `father' in Mandarin. In the first transaction, she had to share commission with the plaintiff, and she did so also in respect of the second transaction and that was the sale of nine units in Casa Rosita to Lauw. In that transaction, she took the commission on the sale of the five units and the plaintiff took the commission on the sale of the four units directly from City Development Limited. She came to know that the Goldhill properties were for sale in June 1988 when she first dealt directly with William Goei in connection with renting of 12,000 sq. ft. of office space at Goldhill Plaza. She was the broker for the renting of that office space and she came to know William Goei personally. Subsequently, she said she was involved in bribing one Vincent Chong who was the property manager of Goldhill group of companies by paying him $3,000 so that he could expedite the processing of the lease of the property to the tenant. The matter was investigated by the CPIB and she was the witness for the CPIB in connection with the prosecution of Vincent Chong. As a result of that case, she came to know Tony Sim.
Lena Wong said that later she became friendly with Tony Sim. She understood from him that William Goei was still interested in selling the Goldhill properties. She told Tony Sim that she would not have a chance with William Goei but Tony Sim said that he knew William Goei very well and would be able to assist her as a friend. Tony Sim suggested that she should look for someone to front for her and accordingly she approached the defendant for the purpose. The defendant agreed. She told the defendant to write to potential buyers in Hong Kong but there was no response. In the meantime, the defendant told her that he had a building for sale and that was 53/55 New Bridge Road and she told him that she had a buyer. She thereupon telephoned Lauw and got in touch with him. She said she shared the same office with the plaintiff and it was she who telephoned Lauw. Lauw came to Singapore on 14 May 1989 and on the following day, she, the plaintiff and Lauw went to see the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road. The defendant and the seller's representative were there. At the site, she introduced Lauw to the defendant. The purchase of the property did not go through. She then casually told Lauw that the Goldhill properties were for sale and that she had a friend who was close to William Goei who could assist. Lauw appeared to be interested and accordingly, she asked Tony Sim to fix an appointment with William Goei and bring the defendant to meet him. Accordingly, an appointment was fixed and Tony Sim brought the defendant to meet William Goei. Thereafter, she told Tony Sim to fix another appointment for Lauw to meet William Goei together with the defendant. The appointment was fixed. She was advised by Tony Sim that neither the plaintiff nor she herself should appear as they might jeopardise the deal.
The hearing of this case was not concluded on the date as originally scheduled and was adjourned. At the continued hearing, Lena Wong recounted substantially what she had said earlier. She said that the plaintiff was never involved in the transaction and that the plaintiff was `a girlfriend' of the buyer. The plaintiff was always with the buyer right from the minute he was in Singapore and that had been the case from the first day she met Lauw. Lena Wong further said that initially Tony Sim did not want a share of the commission; just before the sale, Tony Sim said that he wanted a share of the commission and the plaintiff also said that the buyer wanted a share too. Lena Wong therefore got in touch with the defendant and the defendant said there would be legal complications especially when the CPIB officer was involved and he did not wish to pay the CPIB officer and the buyer. The defendant therefore arranged for cash payment. Thereafter, Tony Sim made an appointment for the defendant to see William Goei to discuss about the matter. The meeting was arranged and that was probably four days before the sale was made. The defendant and Tony Sim attended the meeting with William Goei and she said that after the meeting she was informed that William Goei suggested to split the commission into two portions: +% to be spelled out in the contract and +% to Tony Sim and the buyer which would not be so spelled out.
Lena Wong said she knew Lauw in mid-May 1988. She was introduced to Lauw by the plaintiff and had put through two deals with Lauw after she met him. The first deal was the sale of two units in Tanglin Park and one unit in Pinewood and the second deal was the sale of nine units in Casa Rosita. In both the deals, she shared the commissions with the plaintiff. That was a normal practice. She claimed that in respect of the three sales, she was the one who made the recommendation to Lauw to buy. Around that time, she was sharing the premises with the plaintiff and she was paying most of the bills, rentals, telephone bills and even advertisements. Subsequently, she and the plaintiff split up. She moved out of the premises. Her relationship with the plaintiff had deteriorated before she moved out. That took place before the Goldhill properties deal which was in May 1989.
Lena Wong further testified that on the matter of the Goldhill properties she contacted Lauw and did not revert to the plaintiff. She said that the plaintiff was trying to jeopardise the sale by telling Lauw that the defendant was not a good valuer. She did not agree to share the commission with the plaintiff.
In addition to the viva voce evidence, the parties had produced before me two bundles of documents. In one bundle were affidavits used in the application for summary judgment. Counsel for both parties agreed to these bundles of documents being admitted without formal proof. As for the affidavits they were relied upon by counsel where appropriate, and the deponents thereof confirmed what they had deposed to and were cross-examined thereon. These affidavits therefore formed part of the evidence.
I now turn to the main issue before me: whether there was any agreement by the defendant to pay to the plaintiff , of the commission he had received from the vendors of the Goldhill properties. The factual background and the surrounding circumstances are highly relevant, and I made the following findings. First, until the breakdown of their relationship, the plaintiff and Lena Wong worked very closely together. Both were estate agents; the plaintiff was the sole proprietress of Queensfield Properties and Lena Wong the sole proprietress of Kingsfield Properties; and each regarded the other as her associate; they carried on their respective businesses at the same office and shared the expenses incurred and in several transactions they worked together and shared the commissions earned. This happy and close relationship subsequently broke down; Lena Wong claimed that this happened before the sale of the Goldhill properties. That was highly unlikely; and I think that happened after the sale was concluded but before the sale was completed. Lena Wong moved out of the plaintiff's premises in August 1989 and that happened soon after the plaintiff and Lena Wong had a very heated quarrel in the office at which, according to the plaintiff, Lena Wong threw an ash tray through the glass partition and police was called. That was not denied by Lena Wong.
Secondly, the plaintiff had a long and very close relationship with Lauw and Lauw was regarded as her client. She knew Lauw since 1982. She was the one who introduced Lauw to Lena Wong and that was in mid-1988. In her evidence, Lena Wong said that the plaintiff had a special relationship with Lauw and that she was extremely close to Lauw; right from the minute Lauw was here, the plaintiff was always with him and that had been the case from the first day Lena Wong met Lauw.
Thirdly, there were three transactions, namely, the sales to Lauw of two units in Tanglin Park, one unit in Pinewood and nine units in Casa Rosita, where the plaintiff and Lena Wong shared the commissions. The plaintiff claimed that Lauw bought these properties through her, whereas Lena Wong claimed that these transactions were handled and finalized by her and that she had to give the plaintiff a share of the commission because of the close relationship the plaintiff had with Lauw. I did not accept the evidence of either of them in toto. I think that both of them were involved in those transactions as agents either for the vendors and/or purchasers, and for that reason, they shared the commissions. They were then working very closely together.
Lastly, the defendant also knew the plaintiff well. She was his assistant when she first started at Tong Eng Brothers Pte Ltd and when she started her business, he used to assist her. She even said that he was her `boyfriend'. There was certainly no denying of the fact that they knew each other well. On the business side, they had also dealt with each other. There was certainly one transaction in which the defendant had paid to the plaintiff a share of the commission and that was in relation to his purchase of a unit at Golden Mile Complex. In addition, there were the sales of one unit in 6, Ardmore Park and one unit in Beverly Mai where the three of them, the plaintiff, Lena Wong and the defendant shared the commissions. It is true that in respect of these transactions, the defendant issued his invoices and receipts to Kingsfield Properties. However, he must have known, and my inference was that he was fully aware, that the payments to him were made by Queensfield Properties and that the plaintiff was involved in those transactions, though as a matter of contract, he would look towards Lena Wong for payment of his share of the commissions.
With this factual background and surrounding circumstances, I turn to the findings on the main issue. I was disposed to accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she was aware that the Goldhill properties were on the market for sale sometime in April or May 1989 and that she discussed the properties with Lena Wong. It must have dawned on both of them that Lauw would be a potential buyer for such substantial properties and that both of them would have difficulties in approaching William Goei because of Lena Wong's involvement in bribing William Goei's sale manager. They must have discussed the means of overcoming such difficulty and considered enlisting the help of the defendant to front for them. By that time, Lena Wong must have spoken to Tony Sim who had offered to help her. I was also disposed to accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she was the one who telephoned Lauw and got in touch with him and informed him of the Goldhill properties and that in response he came to Singapore. He came on 14 May 1989. The plaintiff said she introduced Lauw to the defendant at the Sheraton Tower where Lauw was staying and that Lauw could not have used the defendant as a broker without her introduction. That evidence I also accepted. As Lauw was such a strong potential buyer, it was very likely that upon his arrival in Singapore, Lena Wong and the defendant went to the hotel to see him and discussed with him the Goldhill properties, and there the plaintiff (who probably was with Lauw upon his arrival in Singapore) introduced Lauw to the defendant.
I rejected the evidence of Lena Wong that it was she who got in touch with Lauw in connection with the Goldhill properties. Lena Wong's testimony on this point was wholly unconvincing to me. She said that she heard from Tony Sim in April 1989 that William Goei was interested in selling the Goldhill properties; that Tony Sim suggested that she should get someone to front for her; that in early May, she approached the defendant who was agreeable; that she told him to write to potential buyers in Hong Kong but there was no response; that in the meantime, the defendant told her that the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road, was for sale to which she said that she had a buyer; that she got in touch with Lauw in respect of that property; that Lauw came to Singapore on 14 May 1989; that on the following day she brought him to see the building, and that it was there that she introduced the defendant to Lauw. That deal did not go through, and she then `casually' mentioned to Lauw that the Goldhill properties were for sale. I found Lena Wong's evidence here too contrived; it was intended to fit in with the evidence of the defendant that Lena Wong introduced Lauw to him at the site meeting at 53/55 New Bridge Road.
I also did not accept the evidence of the defendant that he was introduced by Lena Wong to Lauw on 15 May at the site meeting when they inspected the building, 53/55 New Bridge Road. According to the defendant, when Lena Wong approached him to be the agent of the Goldhill properties and told him that she had `a substantial buyer', he tried `to size her up' by introducing the property, 53/55 New Bridge Road property, and a meeting at the site was arranged, and it was there that Lena Wong introduced Lauw to him. That indeed was incredible. The defendant at that time knew Lena Wong. They had dealt with each other before and had shared commissions on certain transactions. There was hardly any need for the defendant `to size her up' in respect of either her intention or her connection. I accepted the evidence that Lauw, the plaintiff and Lena Wong went to see the building, and the defendant and the representative of the sellers were present at that meeting. That probably was not the first time Lauw met the defendant. It was possible and indeed, in my view, probable that Lauw being a substantial buyer from Indonesia and having arrived in Singapore, the defendant upon meeting him at the hotel in connection with the Goldhill properties would also have mentioned to him that another property was for sale, and following that the defendant arranged to show him that property.
It was clear to me that in respect of the Goldhill properties, the defendant was requested to front for the plaintiff and Lena Wong as neither of them would be able to secure an appointment to see William Goei even with the assistance of Tony Sim. At that time, certainly Lena Wong did not have any good relationship with William Goei and the plaintiff was an associate of Lena Wong and if either Lena Wong or the plaintiff or both were to act as the agents, William Goei would probably not deal with either of them. If both or either of them could do so, they would not have enlisted the help of the defendant for the purpose. The defendant said that the sale of Goldhill properties was a big deal involving difficult negotiations and Lena Wong suggested that he should be the negotiator, and he agreed. I had great difficulty in accepting such evidence. The defendant certainly did not strike me as possessing such superior skill in negotiation which both the ladies were lacking. In particular, Lena Wong appeared to me to be a very able and astute business woman. It was also clear to me that but for Tony Sim's participation, William Goei would probably not be prepared to see the defendant and discussed with him the Goldhill properties. Tony Sim enjoyed good relationship with William Goei and it was through Tony Sim's introduction that the defendant met William Goei. The defendant was brought along to see William Goei by Tony Sim. Following that, Tony Sim brought Lauw and the defendant to see William Goei and introduced Lauw to William Goei.
Tony Sim in his evidence said that the plaintiff was involved in the transaction, that she was `in the thick of it together with Lena Wong' and that she was liaising with Lauw together with Lena Wong. I accepted his evidence. I also accepted his evidence that it was agreed that the +% commission was to be shared between him, the plaintiff, the defendant and Lena Wong equally. In accepting Tony Sim's evidence, I had borne in mind that he was in a way an interested party in the sense he has instituted an action against the defendant seeking to recover his share of the commission and the action is still pending. I think that initially Tony Sim did not want a share of the commission. This was borne out by the evidence of Lena Wong and Tony Sim himself. Later, he changed his mind. It was in evidence that just before Lauw concluded his negotiations with William Goei, Tony Sim said he wanted a share of the commission and so did the buyer. The inference I drew was that when the prospect of the transaction being concluded became imminent, Tony Sim changed his mind and wanted a share of the commission and Lauw intervened to ensure that the plaintiff would get her share of the commission. Clearly there was an agreement reached then, if it had not been reached earlier, and I so found, that the commission payable by the vendors would be shared by the four of them equally, namely, the plaintiff, Tony Sim, the defendant and Lena Wong.
I think that the evidence of Mrs Eng did shade some light on the issue before me. It was her evidence that the first time when the defendant and Tony Sim came to her office, she explained that the +% commission was to be paid to Tony Sim and the defendant and they agreed to the cheques being made out for payment as to 50% thereof to Tony Sim and the balance of 50% to the defendant and they told her that each of them would look after `his partner'. At that point, Mrs Eng requested the defendant to give a letter authorising payment to Tony Sim and both of them were happy with the suggestion. At that time there was no mistake on the part of the defendant as to what commission Mrs Eng was referring to: it was the +% commission as provided in the sale agreements. My reason for saying this was that prior to that date, on 29 September 1988 the defendant sent to William Goei, among other things, an invoice for the additional +% commission, and Mrs Eng by a letter dated 30 October 1989 wrote to the defendant referring to the invoice and stating in clear terms that the vendors only agreed to pay the +% commission as provided in the sale agreements. Hence, in so far as the payment of the commission was concerned, all three of them were ad idem.
It was also the evidence of Mrs Eng that subsequently Tony Sim telephoned her and said that his portion of the commission would be split between him and the plaintiff and that Tony Sim requested for three cheques to be made out; one cheque in favour of the defendant for 50% of the commission and one in favour of Tony Sim for 25% of the commission and one in favour of the plaintiff for the balance of 25%. On that basis, a draft letter of authorisation was telefaxed by Mrs Eng to the defendant which he was to type on his letterhead. The material part of the draft was as follows:
Please note that we have agreed to share half of the commission with the following persons since they assisted us in the abovementioned sale:
 
 
 
Amount $
 
 
 
Tony Sim NRIC No. 1062926/H 22, Lorong Kembangan Singapore 1441
 
116,347.00

116,347.00
 
 
 
 
232,694.00
 
 
Please therefore issue a cheque of $232,694.00 made in our favour and 2 cheques for $116,347.00 each to the abovenamed.
According to Mrs Eng when Tony Sim and the defendant called again to collect the commission, the defendant only said that he would not sign the letter because of `tax implication'. It is significant that at that moment the defendant never said that the plaintiff whose name appeared on the draft letter was not entitled to any commission. This evidence of Mrs Eng was consistent with the claim of the plaintiff.
It must be borne in mind that by that time the close and happy relationship between the plaintiff and Lena Wong had broken down and there must have been some apprehension on the part of the plaintiff that she might not get her full share of the commission. It must have been agreed between Tony Sim and the plaintiff that she should get the 25% out of the portion that would be paid to Tony Sim. During the cross-examination of Tony Sim, he was asked whether it was his suggestion that the plaintiff should have her share of the commission paid out of his portion to which he replied that he was afraid `that things like this happened and it really happened'. That spontaneous answer was extremely significant and accounted for the reason for Tony Sim's portion to be divided between him and the plaintiff.
I think that the evidence of the plaintiff that after the completion of the sales of the Goldhill properties, the defendant and Lena Wong wanted to reduce her (the plaintiff's) share of the commission had an element of truth. I accepted her evidence. It was corroborated by the evidence of Ong Chong Yam who heard of this from Lena Wong. This reinforced the claim of the plaintiff; if she was not entitled to a share of the commission, there was no question of Lena Wong seeking to reduce her share.
I was unable to accept substantially what the defendant said in his evidence. First, the defendant seemed to have made sweeping statements without too concerned with their truth. In his affidavit filed in opposing the application for summary judgment, he stated more than once that he had never had any business dealing with the plaintiff and sought to give the impression that the plaintiff was a stranger to him. That, as the evidence had shown, was far from the truth. Secondly, the defendant had an inflated notion of himself and his evidence was highly exaggerated. He said that when he was approached by Lena Wong to be the agent for the Goldhill properties, he `sized up' her intention by introducing to her a property, 53/55 New Bridge Road. That, for reasons which I have given, was truly incredible. Further, he said that the sale of the Goldhill properties being a big deal involved difficult negotiation and Lena Wong suggested that he should be the negotiator for the deal. That again was incredible. Both the plaintiff and Lena Wong testified that the defendant was approached to act as the front man. In so far as negotiation is concerned, as I have said, there was no doubt in my mind that Lena Wong was sufficiently capable of negotiating on her own `a big deal'. The defendant also said that he initially objected to Lena Wong using Tony Sim as it was not necessary and the Goldhill properties were on the market, thus implying that he himself could have approached William Goei and introduced the buyer without Tony Sim's involvement. That was most unlikely or improbable, as according to the evidence that emerged, William Goei was a difficult person and would not see any agent whom he did not know. As regards his evidence of the additional +% which he was seeking to obtain from William Goei, I found that he prevaricated; I was not sure whether his evidence was that he was seeking the additional +% for himself or Tony Sim and if it was for the latter, why he had do it. His evidence on this aspect of the transaction was immaterial to my findings but it cast a grave doubt on his credibility and character as a witness and on the veracity of his evidence.
It is significant that the defendant had not at any time prior to the commencement of this action denied that the plaintiff was entitled to a share of the commission. Even when he was confronted with Khattar Wong & Partner's letter of 24 November 1989 which, among other things, set out the plaintiff's and Tony Sim's shares of the commission, there was not the slightest hint or suggestion that neither Tony Sim nor the plaintiff was entitled to the share of the commission as stated therein. At a later stage, in response to Khattar Wong & Partner's subsequent letter seeking a clarification of such sharing of commission, his solicitor wrote and stated, among other things, the following:
We have already stated out clients' position in our last letter. Our clients will pay the parties in question appropriately. The contract to pay the +% commission is between our clients and yours. Your clients have no contractual obligation to the two parties in question. How and when our clients pay the said parties is the responsibility of our clients.
Implicit in this para was an admission that he would pay the parties in question their shares of the commission.
In conclusion, I was unable to accept the evidence of Lena Wong and the defendant that the plaintiff was not involved in the sales of the Goldhill properties to Lauw and that she played no part in the transaction. As I have said, I found that she had discussed with Lena Wong the Goldhill properties and the use of the defendant to front for them; that she was the one who first got in touch with Lauw on the Goldhill properties; that she was the one who introduced Lauw to the defendant at the Sheraton Hotel; that she was `in the thick of it' together with Lena Wong, and that she liaised with Lauw together with Lena Wong. If she was not involved in the transaction at all, there was no reason for her to bring Lauw to UOB Building at the time of signing of the sale agreements and waited for him in her car by the road side - her evidence on this was not challenged or disputed - and there was also no reason for her to celebrate with them on the signing of the sale agreements and to purchase the jade necklaces for the religious purpose. It may be that her participation was not as aggressive and active as Lena Wong's and that she played a lesser role than Lena Wong. But a role in that transaction she did play. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I found that there was an agreement made between all the four of them, the plaintiff, the defendant, Lena Wong and Tony Sim to share the commission equally. I therefore found that her claim had been established.

JUDGMENT
The facts
The plaintiffs are a Singapore company and are associated with a Californian company called Waskita USA Inc (Waskita) in that Waskita's president Khing S Ong (Ong) is a director and shareholder of the plaintiffs. Waskita would source and buy American materials required by the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs would finance the purchase. The defendants, an American company, were at the material time the charterers of a vessel called Zephunter (the vessel) under a charterparty which commenced on 24 September 1990 at Houston (AB12) for one voyage to Asia between Hong Kong and Dumai/Indonesia.
Ong (PW2) testified that some time in April 1990 Waskita (through an Indonesian company) bid and was awarded the tender (see AB1-6), for the supply of gravel pack/drill sand (the cargo) to PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia (Caltex). In turn Waskita ordered the cargo from Texas Mining Company. Ong then arranged for an Illinois freight forwarder US Carriage International (USC) to ship the cargo from Texas to Dumai since Waskita had sold the same to Caltex on a C & F basis. He testified that the reason he used the services of USC was because he had previously supplied the same type of sand to Caltex from another company called US Silica and US Silica had used the services of USC for land as well as sea transportation. Payment to USC in the sum of US$336,000 was made by a letter of credit (the letter of credit) issued by the plaintiffs on the understanding that the proceeds would be apportioned between Texas Mining Company (for the rail transport) and USC (for the loading stevedoring and shipping charges); a separate letter of credit was issued to Texas Mining Company for the value of the cargo.
In September 1990 Ong was informed by Texas Mining Company that the cargo was at a warehouse at Houston ready for inspection and shipment. As required by the Indonesian government Ong arranged for an inspection to be done by surveyors after which he received from USC a copy of a bill of lading issued by Trident Marine (the Trident b/l) dated 20 September 1990 which had been handed to the surveyors. He understood from USC that the Trident b/l (AB14-15) was a house bill of lading issued by a non vessel operated carrier. In the Trident b/l it was stated that freight was prepaid.
On or about 22 October 1990 Ong was contacted for the first time by David Keller (Keller) the president of Project Carriers Inc (PCI) who informed him that PCI were the Houston agents of the defendants, there was a discrepancy in the description of the volume of the cargo and freight had not been received from USC. Keller (DW1) then sent Ong a fax (AB25) to confirm that:
(i) he had arranged a contract between USC and the defendants to ship the cargo; 
(ii) USC had no authority to issue bills of lading on behalf of the Master, only the port agent had the authority; 
(iii)he had been informed by NBD Bank (the Bank) the negotiating bank for the letter of credit (AB9) that payment had been effected on 5 October 1990 even though he had been assured by William Marston (Marston) of USC that the letter of credit would be assigned to the defendants;
(iv) the cargo would only be released against presentation of an original bill of lading issued by the authorised agent General Maritime Agency Inc (which was faxed to Ong); 
(v) since completion of loading of the cargo on 28 September 1990 he had telephoned Marston every other day for payment of the freight and despite Marston's promises that it would be made, no payment had been received;
(vi) PCI were entitled under the bill of lading issued by General Maritime Agency (the defendants' bill of lading) to a lien on the cargo for the freight and they intended to exercise such right if they were not paid that week.
Ong testified that in his conversation with Keller he had asked whether PCI had obtained an assignment of the letter of credit as he (Ong) understood from Marston that USC would assign a portion of the letter of credit to the carrier. After receiving Keller's fax Ong contacted USC and questioned them on the defendants' bill of lading (AB27) and the assignment of the letter of credit. He was told USC had missed the shipping date for a vessel on the Hoegh Line upon which USC had based their quotation to Waskita, USC therefore had to look for and chose the vessel as, an alternative; the Trident b/l was a house bill of lading whereas the defendants' bill of lading was the shipping agents' bill of lading. On the letter of credit Ong was told that because of the dispute on the cargo's volume discrepancy, no payment could be released until the dispute was resolved. In view of the seriousness of the situation Ong handed the fax documents to his lawyers.
Subsequently Ong received by mail three original copies of the defendants' bill of lading (AB20-21) and he noted that it differed from the copy faxed to him by Keller in that it stated 'cargo not to be released unless all freight charges are paid' whereas the fax copy stated 'ocean freight prepaid'. He forwarded the originals thereof to the plaintiffs as they were the notify party on the defendants' bill of lading and gave copies to his lawyers.
Ong then pressurised USC to pay the freight as they had been paid on the letter of credit. USC responded that they would release the freight provided the defendants' misdescription claim on the cargo (of US$86,450) was resolved/waived. Ong understood from USC that the cargo was based on weight, Keller had inspected the cargo, knew the volume and when the vessel could not load all of it, Keller was instructed to purchase two 20 foot containers to complete loading the cargo which price was agreed to be included in the freight (see AB18).
The dispute was not resolved and Waskita commenced proceedings to recover the payment made to USC which proceedings were still pending at the hearing of this suit; in the interim USC had gone bankrupt.
Keller in his evidence said his company was appointed by the defendants to procure cargo for the charterparty and USC had booked space on the vessel with PCI through a liner booking note (the booking note) on 17 July 1990 (AB7-7A). It was the first time PCI and the defendants had dealt with USC. The terms of the booking form were also stated on the reverse side of the defendants' bill of lading and the conditions relevant to this claim are as follows:
Box 9 -- Description of Goods:
1,000 pallets of drilling sand in bags each pallet 2 metric tons 48''x40''x 36'' each total shipment 3200 metric tons/1812 cbm bags are wrapped/strapped on the pallets, with a masonite top pallets are stackable 3 high.
Box 10 -- Freight rate (also indicate whether prepayable or payable at destination):
US$74 per cbm/mt whatever the greater to merchant. Freight is prepaid on signing/releasing bills of lading via wire transfer see attached.
clause 11 -- Freight and charges:
(a) Prepayable freight whether actually paid or not shall be considered as fully earned upon loading and non-returnable in any event. The carrier's claim for any charges under this contract shall be considered definitely payable in like manner as soon as the charges have been incurred. 
(c) The carrier is entitled in case of incorrect declaration of contents, weights, measurements or value of the goods to claim double the amount of freight which would have been due if such declaration had been correctly given...
clause 12 -- Lien:
The carrier shall have a lien for any amount due under this contract and costs of recovering same and shall be entitled to sell the goods privately or by auction to cover any claims.
Keller testified that
a. when the vessel commenced loading the cargo at Houston on 24 September 1990 the packing was found to be inadequate as the pallets broke loose whilst being taken from the warehouse by forklift. He was informed by the pier owner as well as by the port captain that there were many more pallets of the cargo than had been contracted for and the dimensions of the pallets also differed from those stated in the booking note. The result was that the cargo occupied an additional 910 cu m of space on the vessel necessitating some of the cargo being stored on deck together with approximately another 400 cu m of other cargo. He notified USC of the inadequate packing by fax the same day (AB22) and followed up with another fax to Marston on 25 September 1990 on the volume discrepancy;
b. subsequently the defendants on 1 October 1990 faxed to USC an invoice (AB22) for the freight payable on the cargo totalling US$350,650,65 including the volume misdescription claim of $86,450 which was calculated at US$95 per cu m for 910 cu m based on freight charged ex-Singapore which the vessel would otherwise have earned if not for the additional space occupied by the cargo; 
c. his numerous attempts to contact Marston were unsuccessful and it was only after the vessel had sailed that he finally managed to speak to Marston on 15 October 1990. Marston informed him that no monies had been received from Singapore yet and the freight could not be paid; 
d. after further unsuccessful attempts to contact Marston, Keller called the Bank on 22 October 1990 and was informed that payment had been effected to USC on the letter of credit on 5 October and the letter dated 28 August 1990 (the assignment letter) whereby USC purported to assign the proceeds of the letter of credit to the defendants had never been received by the Bank even though it had been faxed to PCI (AB10) by USC when PCI asked for a credit reference on Waskita. He did not check with the Bank after 28 August 1990 and before 22 October 1990 whether it had received the assignment letter although on hindsight he should have; 
e. as he was concerned that some bill of lading other than the defendants' may have been used to negotiate the letter of credit and Marston had mentioned to him that Ong was the person in charge for the shipper which he knew was Waskita, Keller obtained Waskita's number from the Californian telephone operator and contacted and spoke to, Ong and followed up with his fax to Waskita of the same date; 
f. he then conveyed to the defendants as well as to the vessel's Protection and Indemnity Club (P & I Club) his discussion with Ong; g. as at 23 October 1990 he did not know of the existence of the Trident b/l and the first time he saw it was when a copy was received from H E Schurig & Co Pte Ltd (Schurig) who were the defendants' port agent in Singapore. Since the notify party on the Trident b/l was in Singapore the defendants requested Schurig to contact the plaintiffs. On the advice of the P & I Club, all parties including the plaintiffs, Waskita and the issuing bank (NMB Postbank Group NV Singapore) for the letter of credit were put on notice (see AB 29-30) that the Trident b/l was unauthorised and the cargo would only be released against the defendants' bill of lading and against payment of freight. The defendants' bill of lading was then issued and couriered to Waskita; 
h. the signatory of the Trident b/l was Cindy Zimay an employee of USC with whom he spoke on several occasions to ensure that the cargo was delivered to the pier on time; 
i. although it was PCI's responsibility to book cargo for the vessel, it was not their duty to collect the freight which was left to the defendants.
A director of the defendants K Nielsen (Nielsen) confirmed Keller's testimony. Nielsen (DW2) further said:
a. the actual space occupied by the cargo of 3237.52mt/2722 cu m was verified by the defendants' surveyor; 
b. the vessel loaded at Houston cargo which included construction materials, oil drilling equipment and drill sand and the same was stored in such a manner that the vessel would call at South Korea, Singapore and Dumai in that order; 
c. the additional space (910 cu m) occupied by the cargo did not cause other cargo to be shut out but it did result in loading on deck cargo which was supposed to be loaded below deck; 
d. the assignment letter meant very little to him and he merely took it as a sign of good faith from the shipper's agent USC since there was no confirmation of the same by either the Bank or PCI. It was for the Bank not the defendants to confirm that the letter of credit had been assigned to the defendants;
e. as far as the defendants were concerned USC was a freight forwarder acting for a principal which was Waskita; he denied that USC acted as agents for the defendants;
f. in November 1990 (AB35) USC through their lawyers Hodes & Pilon offered to pay the defendants US$259,360 in exchange for the delivery of the cargo to the plaintiffs in Singapore which payment comprised of contractual freight at US$74 weight/measure, terminal charge and wharfage but the offer was rejected by the defendants as it was not the full sum claimed; 
g. instead the defendants' lawyers Keck Mahin & Cate counter-proposed (see AB38) that USC pay the defendants' invoice at AB22 in full and the sum of US$86,450 representing the misdescription claim would be placed in an interest bearing escrow account pending arbitration or settlement. Otherwise a maritime lien would be placed on the cargo at Dumai, it would be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy the outstanding claim;
There was further correspondence exchanged between both parties' lawyers as well as with Waskita's counsel (Hart & Mieras) in November/December 1990. However nothing fruitful emerged therefrom as no party was prepared to compromise its position and the deadline of 23 November 1990 imposed by Waskita's counsel to resolve the impasse came and went. Suffice it to say that despite their repeated requests, the defendants' lawyers never received any explanation from USC's lawyers as to, the role of Trident Marine and how its bill of lading came to be issued and why despite the assignment letter no assignment of the proceeds of the letter of credit was ever effected to the defendants. In the event the defendants did not receive a single cent in payment of freight. Meanwhile the vessel had arrived at Singapore and the cargo had been discharged into a warehouse by Schurig after they had notified the plaintiffs on 14 November 1990 (AB47) that the same would be released to the plaintiffs on presentation of the defendants' original bill of lading.
The plaintiffs' manager Jeffrey Tan (Tan) testified that by October 1990 he had received the Trident b/l followed by Schurig's fax dated 26 October 1990 (AB34) informing him that the Trident b/l was not valid. Subsequently he received the defendants' original bill of lading from Waskita. Prior to the vessel's arrival in Singapore which was on or about 4 December 1990 Tan (PW1) left it to Waskita to resolve the problem of the two bills of lading issued for the cargo as at that time the plaintiffs did not know who PCI and Schurig were. Indeed he left the entire matter to Waskita/Ong to handle until after the cargo had been discharged in Singapore when, on Ong's instructions, the plaintiffs' lawyers commenced this suit on 27 December 1990 and on the same day they obtained an order of court for the cargo to be released after Schurig's demand for payment of freight was rejected by the plaintiffs.
The court order was subsequently varied on the defendants' application and the cargo was released to the plaintiffs upon their furnishing security to the defendants by way of a banker's guarantee for US$244,000 to preserve the defendants' lien for freight and for damages. Under cross-examination Tan said he believed the plaintiffs tendered the Trident b/l to Schurig to obtain delivery of the cargo and not the defendants' bill of lading as the latter was not endorsed by the plaintiffs' banker.
The plaintiffs eventually transhipped the cargo to Dumai, Indonesia in January 1991 at a cost of S$105,536.92.
The claim
In the statement of claim the plaintiffs inter alia pleaded:
(i) they were at all material times the holders of and/or endorsees of the Trident b/l by reason whereof they were the owners of the cargo;
(ii) the Trident b/l evidenced the contract of carriage for the cargo from Houston to Dumai, Indonesia and so did the defendants' bill of lading; 
(iii)in breach of the contract evidenced in the Trident b/l alternatively in the defendants' bill of lading (the validity of which was disputed), the defendants did not carry or deliver the cargo to Dumai but instead landed it in Singapore in the purported exercise of their lien for unpaid freight;
(iv) by reason of the defendants' breach the plaintiffs had suffered loss and damage as follows: 
(a) repair of damaged cargo before transhipment S$3,101.00 
(b) port charges and freight cost to Dumai S$105,536.92
(c) liquidated damages payable to Clatex for late delivery Pending 
(d) commission paid on banker's guarantee US$1,230.00
The plaintiffs inter alia prayed for 
(i) a declaration that the defendants were not and are not entitled to exercise a lien on the cargo 
(ii) the return and cancellation of the banker's guarantee for US$224,000 and
(iii) damages to be assessed by the Registrar. No evidence was adduced by the plaintiffs to show that they had to pay damages to Caltex for late delivery of the cargo although Waskita's counsel had indicated to their counterpart for USC (see AB41) that Caltex would suffer US$10,000-$20,000 per day as downtime for the consequential delay in Caltex's drilling operations.
In the defence and counterclaim the defendants admitted that the plaintiffs were the endorsees and holders of the Trident b/l but contended:
(i) the Trident b/l was issued fraudulently and without the authority of the defendants who were the disponent owners of the vessel; 
(ii) the contract of carriage was that evidenced in the booking note dated 17 July 1990 made between the defendants and USC which expressly provided for freight at the rate of US$74 per cu m/mt 'whatever the greater to the merchant' to be prepaid on signing or release of the bills of lading; 
(iii)in breach of the express terms a. the cargo when loaded was not 3200 mt/1812 cu m but 3237.52 mt/2722 cu m resulting in a loss of cargo space of 910 cu m; b. freight was not prepaid upon completion of loading of the cargo or at all.
(iv) the defendants waived the aforesaid breach of USC by issuing the defendants' bill of lading to Waskita in accordance with the terms of the booking note but with the notation 'cargo not to be released unless all freight charges are paid' and with the correct gross weight of the cargo of 3,237.52 mt specified; 
(v) the defendants' demand for payment of the freight was made known to USC their servants or agents and to the plaintiffs, their servants or agents. The plaintiffs however asserted that they possessed a freight prepaid bill of lading issued by Trident Marine by which the plaintiffs evinced an intention not to pay the freight due to the defendants;
(vi) the defendants in exercise of their lien for freight and to mitigate their loss landed the cargo in Singapore.
The defendants counterclaimed for US$350,650.65 representing the sum (US$264,200.65) agreed by the parties to be the freight for carriage of the cargo from Houston to Dumai and the loss of cargo space of 910 cu m (US$86,450) due to misdescription of the cargo.
The findings
This is a case where neither litigant was at fault and the court has to decide which of two innocent parties must bear the loss which was caused by the acts of a third party which in this case was USC. On the one hand the plaintiffs had paid to USC US$336,000 for freight and were further out of pocket by S$105,536.92 in having to tranship the cargo to Dumai and on the other hand the defendants did not receive any freight for carrying the cargo on the vessel.
The issues that arise for determination are as follows:
(i) was there a contract of carriage for the cargo and if so was it evidenced in the Trident b/l or in the defendants' bill of lading? 
(ii) was there a misdescription of the quantity/volume of the cargo and did it entitle the defendants to claim US$86,450 arising therefrom?
(iii)were the defendants justified in landing the cargo in Singapore in exercise of their lien for freight and to mitigate their loss?
(iv) are the defendants still entitled to payment of freight notwithstanding that they did not complete the voyage to Dumai?
Before dealing with the four issues, it is necessary to determine the role of USC vis a vis the plaintiffs and the defendants. It is common ground that USC were freight forwarders but what is in issue is whether their role was independent or that of agents and if the latter, agents for which party. The plaintiffs' stand is that USC were acting as agents for the defendants and therefore their payment of freight by the letter of credit is deemed to have been payment to the defendants. The defendants contend that even if USC were their agents USC not being authorised to issue the Trident b/l, recourse must be had against USC and not the shipowner and this was what Waskita did in suing USC for recovery of the freight paid by the plaintiffs.
The position at law is that depending on the facts of a case and the construction of the contract concerned, freight forwarders can act either as agent or as principal although they qualify more often as principals than as agents (see Schmitthoff's Export Trade 9 ed p 304 onwards). If the forwarder acts as the customer's agent, his duty is to procure with due diligence others who perform the carriage, storage, packing or handling of the goods. The customer, through the forwarder, enters into direct contractual relations with others. Where the forwarder acts as principal, he enters into a contract of services with the customer, he is the only person with whom the customer is in contractual relations even though the actual services which the forwarder has undertaken is carried out by others. It is also possible where the forwarder is instructed to arrange for the carriage of goods that he acts in a 'hybrid' capacity that is as a carrier for the land segment and as forwarding agent for the sea leg of the journey.
To determine whether USC acted as principal or agent, the following factors are relevant:
a. USC issued their own house bill of lading viz the Trident b/l; b. their remuneration would be their profit from the freight which rate (US$4.80 per bag) they separately quoted to and which was accepted by, the plaintiffs and not based on a commission payable by the shipowner or the latter's freight rate, and c. they collected the cargo for Waskita instead of arranging for the collection by a third party.
It seems to me such factors point to USC acting as principal rather than as agent. Further the description of USC under 'merchant' in box 4 of the booking note (see cl 1) includes 'the shipper, the Receiver, the Consignee, the Holder of the bill of lading and the Owner of the goods'-- USC were the receivers of the cargo. The defendants' invoice was also addressed to USC (AB22).
USC contracted as principal in the booking note with the defendants through PCI. It is noteworthy that the defendants in para 6 of the defence pleaded that notwithstanding the breach by USC of the various terms of the booking note, the defendants waived the same and continued to perform their obligations thereunder. It is also in evidence that the conditions governing the booking note were the same as those in the defendants' bill of lading.
The Trident b/l was said by Keller to have been signed by an employee of USC. Although this house bill of lading was said to have been issued without the defendants' authority it is to be noted that the Trident b/l differed from the defendants' bill of lading only in two respects namely, the date of shipment and, that the former was issued 'clean on board' whereas the latter was claused due to the inadequate packing of the cargo and the defendants' claim for additional freight and other expenses; all other terms were more or less the same in both bills of lading including the condition that freight was to be prepaid. This is not a case where the bill of lading was fraudulently issued because no goods were ever loaded on the vessel in question but only that the goods were loaded later than the date stated and the alleged issuing party (Trident Marine) had no authority from the carrier. There is authority to suggest that in the hands of an innocent party a fraudulently dated bill of lading is perfectly valid (see United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd v Royal Bank of Canada < 1983 > A C 168).
Therefore in answer to issue (i) I hold that there was a contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants for carriage of the cargo from Houston to Dumai evidenced in the Trident b/l which terms were not dissimilar to those in the defendants'bill of lading in particular that freight must be prepaid. It was the evidence of Tan that in order to take delivery of the cargo from Schurig in January 1991, the plaintiffs tendered the Trident b/l not the defendants' bill of lading.
On issue (ii), bearing in mind the freight rate stipulated in box 10 of the booking note (and also in the defendants' bill of lading), the defendants were entitled to charge freight based on either volume or weight whichever was the greater at their option. However the defendants' entitlement to maximise their earnings cannot extend to 'double charging' the plaintiffs based on the full tonnage loaded namely 3237.52 mt (37.52 mt more than what was stated in the booking note) and at the same time claiming for additional freight based on the excess volume of 910 cu m. I agree with the plaintiffs' submission that the defendants must elect to base their claim either on volume or on weight, not claim on both.
Accordingly the defendants' claim for freight would be either for US$236,800 or US$134,088 made up as follows:
3200 mt x $74 = $236,800 
1812 cu m x $74 = $134,088
As for the defendants' claim for additional freight (the mis description claim) at the rate of US$95, again this can only be in addition to either of the two foregoing figures but it cannot be added to the defendants' claim based on the total tonnage or volume loaded (see AB22). Therefore the defendants' claim for additional freight if valid is for either US$3,564.40 or US$86,640 made up as follows:
37.52 mt x $95 = $3,564.40 
910 cu m x $95 = $86,450
If as they contend, the defendants were entitled to maximise their claim for freight and additional freight, then they would be entitled to US$322,640:
3200 mt x $74 = $236,800 910
cu m x $95 = $ 86,450 
Total = $322,450
and not US$326,026.48 ($239,576.48 + $86,450).
In any event the defendants are not pursuing the various sums stated in their invoice but only the freight that would have been due to them for carrying the cargo to Dumai (US$264,200.65) for which no computation was given but which figure was agreed to by the plaintiffs if the defendants should succeed in their counterclaim.
In so far as the misdescription claim is concerned, I would agree with the defence contention that they were and are entitled to the additional US$86,450 pursuant to cl 11(e) of the terms and conditions governing the booking note which allows them to claim double the amount of freight in case of incorrect declaration of contents, weights, measurements or value of the goods.
I shall now deal with the remaining two issues. The defendants' entitlement under the booking note is to prepaid freight on signing/releasing of bills of lading. On the one hand the defendants assert that the plaintiffs did not pay the freight as per their demand and on the other hand the plaintiffs contend that freight amounting to US$336,000 having already been paid to USC, the defendants cannot demand it again.
At law (Scrutton on Charterparties 19 ed pp 333-334) advance freight must be paid though the goods are, after the due date of payment, but before payment, lost by excepted perils, and it will not be recoverable from the shipowner if the goods are after payment so lost. It will be recoverable however if the shipowner has not fulfilled the condition precedent of starting the carriage of the goods on the agreed voyage in a seaworthy ship within a reasonable time.
Applying the principles to this case, it means that Waskita cannot recover the freight paid to USC notwithstanding that the voyage to Dumai was not completed. Freight if payable in advance is payable for the whole journey and the shipper is not entitled to a pro rata return of the freight for other stages as if the consideration had failed, even if calculated separately for each stage and even if the forwarder (which is what happened here) has not paid over any part of the freight relating to stages of the journey to be performed by other companies.
It is also stated in Scrutton (pp 45-46) that the position of a forwarding agent acting as a principal with the liability of a carrier is in many respects similar to that of a carrier issuing a through bill of lading. The forwarding agent usually has the right to employ sub-contractors to perform all or part of the carriage; the right may be implied by custom or as a necessary implication in the case of a forwarding agent who does not operate his own ship or other facilities. In this case that would mean that the defendants were USC's sub-contractors and the latter are not a party to the contract of carriage.
As USC acted as principal and as the plaintiffs had paid to USC in advance the freight from Houston to Dumai, the defendants cannot demand freight again from the plaintiffs notwithstanding that USC failed to pay over the freight they had collected from the letter of credit. Accordingly it must follow that the defendants are not entitled to a lien on the cargo for freight and were not justified in landing the cargo at Singapore in the purported exercise of their lien for freight. They are however entitled to additional freight for the excess 910 cu m shipped amounting to US$86,450. The defendants would have been entitled to freight Houston-Dumai as follows:
Agreed freight US$264,200.65 Additional freight US$ 86,450.00 Total freight US$350,650.65
However as the plaintiffs have paid to USC $336,000 the defendants' entitlement is only to the difference of $14,650.65 (350,650.65 - 336,000) against which the plaintiffs can set off the transhipment and incidental expenses incurred at Singapore of S$108,637.92 as well as the commission (US$1,230) paid on the banker's guarantee for US$224,000.
There will therefore be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sums of S$108,637.92 and US$1,230 and the banker's guarantee for US$224,000 shall be returned to them forthwith. There will be judgement for the defendants on the counterclaim in the sum of US$14,650.65. As the plaintiffs have succeeded in their claim and so have the defendants on their counterclaim albeit in a much smaller sum I feel that a fair order as to costs would be for the plaintiffs to have 2/3 of the taxed costs of the entire action and all previous costs which were ordered to be costs in the cause. Each party shall bear its own costs pertaining to the release of the plaintiffs' cargo and to the variation of that order for release. I am not directing the Registrar to assess damages as no evidence was adduced to show any damage was suffered by the plaintiffs in their late delivery of the cargo to Indonesia other than the expenses claimed and allowed.",1993-05-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

ORAL JUDGMENT
This action, which was started on 14 October 1989 by Jacky's Electronics (S) Pte Ltd against Komrades Air/Sea Forwarders Pte Ltd (formerly known as Komrades Air & Sea Forwarders Pte Ltd), was founded on an alleged breach of the contract of bailment allegedly entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants and under which the plaintiffs allege the defendants had failed or refused to deliver to them a total of 44,000 rolls of film. Of those films, it was alleged that 18,100 rolls of Konica SR-V100 135-24 and 25,800 rolls of Konica SR-V100 135-36 were missing. It was also alleged that 100 rolls of Konica SR-V200 110-24 discharged from motor vessel ""Gao Cheng"" were damaged. The claim in contract was the value of the Konica films at $133,136.
The bulk of the rolls of Konica film was discharged from motor vessel ""YS Prosperty"" which was contained in two containers. They were said to have been contained in 422 cartons, each of which contained 10 boxes and each box contained 100 rolls of film. They were allegedly sold by United Sources Trading Co (""USTC"") of Dubai to Jacky's International, a limited company in Hong Kong.
In the alternative, the plaintiffs also claim damages for conversion, presumably in the same sum. For them to succeed in the tort of conversion, the plaintiffs have to prove on a balance of probabilities that they were the owners of the Konica films.
The plaintiffs are a company dealing in Konica films in Singapore and the secretary of the managing director, Ms Meenatshi Sundari Bagavathy (PW1), gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. PW2, Mr Govindasamy Kovalakrishnan, who went by the name of Mr Gopal, also gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. PW2 was at all material times a sole-proprietor of G K Express, which was a sole-proprietorship in 1988, and was in the forwarding business. Since 1989 the sole-proprietorship was converted to a private limited company of which PW2 is the managing director. Ms Sundari engaged G K Express to collect and store the Konica films and to effect deliveries of parts of the consignment to customers of the plaintiffs in Singapore.
According to the evidence, there were altogether three storages of three containers of Konica films. Mr Gopal was introduced to Mr Karuppiah (known as ""Kannan"") of defendants by a family friend sometime in October 1988. Shortly thereafter the plaintiffs informed Mr Gopal of the anticipated arrival of the first batch of Konica films. Mr Gopal visited Mr Karuppiah and he said in evidence that he discussed the terms of storage. He agreed on the rate to be charged for the storage of the goods. He also said that eventually he paid for the storage charges directly out of his own sole-proprietorship and he charged the plaintiffs a separate and a higher storage rate. He, of course, went on to say that he did tell Mr Karuppiah of the defendants that G K Express were not the owners of the rolls of Konica film.
In the event, the first shipment arrived in December and was stored in the defendants' premises for which a Storing Order was issued by the defendants in favour of G K Express. The second Storing Order was issued for the second shipment. The defendants duly returned all the rolls of film. Both shipments are not really directly in issue nor involved in this action except for the 100 rolls of film which were damaged and which I mentioned earlier.
It is the third shipment which looms large in this case. As evidenced by Storing Order No 1283 issued by the defendants in favour of G K Express, 422 cartons of specified measurements were stored with the defendants. Under the column 'Marking & Number', there were stated ""Konica Films"". It is significant to note there is no mention of any agency whatsoever in this document. For eg. G K Express was not described as ""Agents of (the plaintiffs)"" or simply ""As Agents"". Secondly, and it is not really material but worthwhile to mention, the defendants had stamped on the documents just above the signature the words ""Goods & Quantity unchecked"". There is no other document disclosed in this court which connected or indicated a nexus between the plaintiffs and the goods.
We have to return to the oral evidence of both Ms Sundari and Mr Gopal. All it boils down to is that there is evidence that Ms Sundari visited the defendants' premises after the first visit of Mr Gopal in which Mr Gopal had come to a provisional agreement on some matters, particularly the rate of the storage charges. Ms Sundari later inspected the defendants' premises and expressed the view that they were acceptable for storage. Mr Gopal said that Ms Sundari had said to Mr Karuppiah that plaintiffs were the owners of the goods. Mr Gopal went on further to say in evidence that he had told Mr Karuppiah that G K Express was not the owner of the goods in question. That was the sum total of the evidence bearing on the question whether the plaintiffs were an undisclosed principal in privity with the defendants under the contract of bailment as evidenced in the third Storing Order.
I turn first to the question whether there was an expressed contract of bailment which was entered into by G K Express on the express authority of the plaintiffs. There is absolutely no evidence from either Ms Sundari or Mr Gopal which begin to establish that Ms Sundari on behalf of the plaintiffs had clothed Mr Gopal trading as G K Express with the express authority to enter into any contract of bailment for and on behalf of the plaintiffs. Mr Suresh on behalf of the plaintiffs stressed that he relies on the doctrine of undisclosed principal between the plaintiffs and the defendants. Now, he is saying that a court could in certain circumstances infer by an agent's disclosure of the existence of the principal to the other party which would result in the formation of a contract which was in truth and in substance entered into between the other party and the undisclosed principal. Nominally, the contract was apparently formed between the agent (though not mentioned as such) and the other party. If a person is an undisclosed principal in connection with a contract, it is of course the law that that undisclosed principal can sue the other party to the agreement simply because the underlying principle is that the other party had known or ought to have known that he was contracting with the undisclosed principal. This common law development of the doctrine was in recognition of the growing multiplicity of parties involved in transactions, particularly like the middleman, referred to by Lord Lindley in Keighley, Maxsted & Co v Durant < 1901 > AC 240 at 261. But as rightly pointed out by Mr Jeyaretnam that case does not help the plaintiffs at all because it was a case that principally dealt with the question of ratification. Each case must turn on its own facts. There is nothing here on the evidence given by the plaintiffs to suggest that what they have said about ownership was enough to impute on Mr Karuppiah the knowledge and therefore his agreement and consent that he was entering into the contract with the plaintiffs as owners of the Konica films. Now, I need not say much about Stockton v Morton < 1979 > RTR 130 which was relied by Mr Suresh. Again, I am in agreement with Mr Jeyaretnam when he said that that case dealt with the ambit of the authority of the insurance broker who was clearly the agent of the insurance company and where, in a particular situation, that insurance broker could and would bind his principal. We are concerned with the question of who was the contracting party rather than with the ambit of an agent's authority.
So quite obviously, there is completely insufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the contract of bailment as evidenced by the Storing Order of 16 December 1988 found in AB7 was entered into between G K Express and the defendants with the plaintiffs as the undisclosed principal. I find that the plaintiffs were a total stranger and a third party wholly unconnected in contract with the defendants in respect of the storage for bailment of 422 cartons of Konica films.
I turn very briefly to the state of evidence on the ownership of the rolls of film. The question of ownership is most important on the plaintiffs' alternative claim founded on the tort of conversion. Although Mr Suresh had conceded that the plaintiffs had certain difficulties of proving ownership, I must say that the evidence of the plaintiffs' alleged ownership of the goods is wholly unsatisfactory. They had produced a copy of the original bill of lading but it was generally endorsed. Evidence was given that the plaintiffs had possession and control of the 422 cartons but as everybody knows possession is not ownership. They could have been agents for the true owners, Jacky's International. If it had been a suit in detinue, it seems to me on the evidence the right to possession so far as the defendants were concerned was G K Express because it was G K Express who had stored the goods with them. In terms the Storing Order stated ""This Storing Order must be produced when delivery of Cargo is requested"". So far as the 422 cartons of Konica films are concerned, they were said to have been sold by USTC of Dubai to a company in Hong Kong which appears to have been associated with the plaintiffs. Who paid for the goods? On that question there is absolutely no evidence.
I should also say a few words on the attempt to prove ownership at the resumed hearing this afternoon. Ms Sundari attempted to produce the debit notes under which the Hong Kong company purportedly debited the accounts of the plaintiffs in a running account between the two entities. Accompanied with the debit notes were copies of Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong Ltd's advice of the negotiation of a draft drawn by USTC and the invoice of USTC. The latter two documents were withdrawn by Mr Suresh because there was no compliance with s 63 and following of the Evidence Act. I came to the conclusion that the pre-conditions as set out in s 32 of the Evidence Act were not complied with. There was in fact no evidence as to who the maker of the debit notes was, let alone evidence to show that the maker could not have been called to give evidence on the debit notes without unreasonable expense.
A further attempt to establish ownership was made by Ms Sundari producing a list of ledgers. She was not the maker of that document which allegedly recorded the debiting of the plaintiffs in the running account between the plaintiffs and the Hong Kong associated company. By that evidence it was sought to be established that the plaintiffs had given value for the rolls of Konica film and therefore they could properly claim that they were owners of the goods. Here again, I declined to admit the list of ledgers because it was not shown to me that it was too expensive or not possible or otherwise unreasonable to procure the attendance of the maker to give evidence as required by s 32 to enable hearsay evidence to be introduced. Obviously, we have to observe the provisions of s 32 which is an exception to the hearsay rule. If s 32 applies the other party will have no opportunity to cross examine on the evidence admitted. We must therefore be careful and take steps to ensure compliance with the pre-conditions as set out in s 32 of the Evidence Act.
So, at the end of the case for the plaintiffs, Mr Jeyaretnam made the submission of no case to meet. On being put to election whether to call evidence or not, he confirmed that the defendants would elect not to call any evidence if my ruling had gone against the defendants. Now, in view of what I had said, it is quite clear that the plaintiffs had not proved their claims founded in contract or in tort.
Their claims are accordingly dismissed with costs.",1993-05-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The plaintiffs are a firm of registered architects and civil and structural engineers. The defendants are a family company of property owners. The claim is for architectural and engineering services rendered by the plaintiffs to the defendants in respect of the development of a shopping cum office complex on Lots 9-15 and 9-23 T.S XXVII known as the `Heeren Centre' (the project). The plaintiffs were appointed by the defendants as the project's architects and engineers sometime in November 1981. Their services were terminated by the defendants on 5 June 1989. As at the date of termination the plaintiffs had obtained written permission for the construction of a 22-storey building and the building plans were virtually complete. The dispute centred on the quantum (not the entitlement) of the payment to the plaintiffs as at the date of the termination of their services. At the end of the trial I gave judgment for the plaintiffs for one-half of 10% of the estimated cost of the building which I fixed at $50m, less all sums of money paid to the plaintiffs to account of their fees and costs to be taxed. I awarded the plaintiffs interest on the sums due to them at 6% per annum from the date of the writ.
The defendants have appealed against this judgment. I now give my reasons.
The defendants own a vast amount of landed property in Singapore. The founder of the defendants was a wealthy Malaysian by the name of Chee Swee Cheng. His grandson, Chee Bay Hoon, inherited the defendants. Alfred Chung Meng Ang (Alfred Chung), the second plaintiff, is the principal architect in the plaintiffs. Sometime in 1967 Alfred Chung had occasion to meet Chee Bay Hoon in connection with the signing of building plans he had prepared for a client, for the extension of a building on land in Orchard Road which was owned by the defendants. This chance meeting led to Alfred Chung and Chee Bay Hoon coming on friendly terms, a relationship, which Alfred Chung avowed when giving evidence, he cultivated. This relationship led to Chee Bay Hoon and the defendants engaging the plaintiffs as their architects and engineers. It is in evidence that Alfred Chung himself became somewhat of a confidante to Chee Bay Hoon on whose advice Chee Bay Hoon decided to develop the defendants' properties in the Orchard Road area as a hedge against compulsory acquisition by the government.
In 1968 the plaintiffs had been engaged as the defendants' architects and engineers in connection with the development of a property in Devonshire Road and another in Bideford Road. A third development for which the plaintiffs' services were engaged by the defendants was in 1973 of a property in River Valley Road. Alfred Chung said in his evidence that for these three developments there had been no formal agreement as to the basis of the plaintiffs' professional charges but that he had explained to Chee Bay Hoon, who personally over-saw these developments for the defendants, that the plaintiffs' charges would be based on the Singapore Institute of Architects' (SIA) scale of charges. Accordingly, the plaintiffs had charged a fee of 10% of the total construction costs and the defendants had accepted these charges and had paid. He pointed out that there was no dispute whatsoever over the plaintiffs' charges. In fact Alfred Chung pointed out in his evidence that before the River Valley Road development was awarded to the plaintiffs, Chee Bay Hoon had offered the plaintiffs a retainer of $3,000 per month if the plaintiffs would reduce the percentage from 10% to 7+% but he, Alfred Chung, on behalf of the plaintiffs had refused to accept the retainer and insisted on the plaintiffs' fees being 10% of the total construction costs. Chee Bay Hoon on behalf of the defendants had accepted and had gone on to award the plaintiffs the River Valley Road development. In corroboration of all this Alfred Chung referred in evidence to the correspondence and the plaintiffs' bills relating to these three developments to substantiate his contention that by a course of dealing there was to be implied an agreement that the plaintiffs' professional charges would be based on the SIA scale of charges, that is to say 7+% for the architectural services and 2+% for the engineering services, making a total of 10% of the total construction costs.
The project itself was first conceived in 1977 but had to be shelved as part of the land on which the development was to take place had been leased out. Steps had to be taken to terminate the lease and repossess the land. This was achieved only in November 1981 and it was then that the defendants had commissioned the plaintiffs to apply for planning approval of a 27-storey building. Planning approval, subject to certain conditions was ultimately obtained in January 1983 for a 22- storey building.
In the meanwhile in 1982 the plaintiffs were commissioned by the defendants to carry out another development at Upper East Coast Road. This development of 42 units of townhouses and flats was completed in 1984 and as previously the plaintiffs based their professional charges at 10% of the total construction costs. The correspondence and bills relating to this development were referred to in evidence by Alfred Chung. They clearly show that the basis of the plaintiffs' professional charges to be 10% (i.e 7+% for architectural and 2+% for engineering) of the total construction costs. These charges were duly paid by the defendants.
I have referred to the background of the dealing between the plaintiffs and the defendants to show what the course of dealing or the course of conduct was between them, in so far as the plaintiffs' professional charges were concerned, in respect of the developments for which they were engaged by the defendants. As between Alfred Chung who represented the plaintiffs and Chee Bay Hoon who represented the defendants in these developments there was in my judgment no question but that the professional charges of the plaintiffs would be 10% of the total construction costs and that the SIA conditions would apply. It was Alfred Chung's evidence that it was to be implied that the plaintiffs' professional charges for the project was also 10% of the total construction costs. However the defendants disputed this at the trial. The defendants did not dispute that whatever the arrangements were, the arrangements were in fact entered into by Alfred Chung for the plaintiffs and Chee Bay Hoon for the defendants. The defendants did not call Chee Bay Hoon to controvert the evidence of Alfred Chung and as there was no formal agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants regarding the plaintiffs' professional charges for the project the conclusion is inevitable that it was to be implied that the arrangement would be as it was in the case of all the other developments of the defendants, i.e 10% of the total construction costs.
In so far as it is necessary for me to make a finding I find that when the plaintiffs were engaged as the defendants' architects and engineers for the project in November 1981 it was on the implied agreement that the plaintiffs' charges for their services would be charged at 10% of the total construction costs of the project.
As I have said the defendants failed to call Chee Bay Hoon as a witness. I was told that Chee Bay Hoon was ill and was thus unable to attend court to give evidence. I do not doubt that Chee Bay Hoon was ill. The fact however remains that only Chee Bay Hoon could have controverted the evidence of Alfred Chung. If Chee Bay Hoon was unable to attend court when the trial commenced in April 1993 steps could have been taken to record his evidence de bene esse or when fortuitously the trial was part heard the further hearing dates could have been taken to suit the convenience of Chee Bay Hoon. The defendants did not do this but relied solely on the evidence of their only witness, James Chee. I have no choice but to conclude that had Chee Bay Hoon been called as a witness his evidence would not have supported the defendants' contention at the trial that there was no understanding between him representing the defendants and Alfred Chung representing the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs' charges, as the defendants' architects and engineers, for the project was based on the SIA conditions and was to be charged at 10% of the construction costs of the project.
James Chee is the son of Chee Bay Hoon. He came to Singapore from Malaysia in 1974 to look after the defendants' properties in Singapore. He was involved in the defendants' development of their properties in Singapore but only as a supervisor of the construction works. On his own admission in evidence he was never involved in discussing the development concepts, the costs of the developments and other financial details which were exclusively done by Chee Bay Hoon himself. He frankly admitted that he had no knowledge of the fee arrangements, if any, that were made by Chee Bay Hoon on behalf of the defendants with Alfred Chung on behalf of the plaintiffs for any of the developments undertaken by the defendants including the project.
I must confess that I failed to understand during the trial and I am also unable to understand even now, reading the transcript of his evidence again, the relevance of his evidence of obtaining from Alfred Chung a copy of the SIA conditions and scale of charges and whether it was the 1979 edition or was it some earlier edition. I also failed to understand the importance defendants' counsel attached to this as both Peter Von Selkey (PW-2) and Raymond Kuah Leong Heng (DW-2) were agreed that the SIA conditions were in existence from as early as 1972, if not before, and was extensively relied on by practising architects in basing their charges for their professional services.
It was evident, however, that what the defendants were endeavouring to do was to show that in so far as the charges for the plaintiffs' professional services were concerned for the project there was no agreement, express or implied, so as to rely on the Architect's Rules 1982. Since I have found that there was to be implied from the course of dealing between the plaintiffs and the defendants that there was an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the plaintiffs' charges for their professional services would be based on the SIA conditions and be charged at 10% of the total construction costs, the Architect's Rules 1982 has no relevance whatsoever for the purposes of computing the fee to be paid to the plaintiffs for their professional services for the project from November 1981 to termination on 5 June 1989.
I now turn to consider the estimated cost of construction of the project. It is agreed by both parties that up to the time of termination there was no agreement on the construction costs of the project. The only evidence of what was contemplated, of which there is no dispute, came from Alfred Chung who testified that his brief was, `to build a building taller than Yen San Building and to fully utilise the plot ratio'.
It was not until James Chee had made a verbal request, at the instigation of Tan Kok Soon, the manager of the defendants who was also an executor of the late Chee Swee Cheng, in 1984 that an estimate was given by the plaintiffs. In the course of applying for planning permission it was necessary for the plaintiffs to furnish to the planning department certain statistical information among which is to give the estimated cost of construction of the proposed development. In this connection the plaintiffs had estimated the cost of construction of the project at $40m. This was in February 1982. So when James Chee had made his verbal request the plaintiffs wrote to him on 2 May 1984 as follows:-
`We refer to your verbal request.
We would suggest that for your budgeting purposes the following building cost estimates be taken:-
(i) ...
(ii) Proposed office/shopping complex at Orchard Road/Cairnhill Road (the project) - S$40 million.
Please note that our estimate given above for your ""Heeren Centre"" does not include for your compensation to existing rent-controlled tenants nor legal and ancillary fees required.
Furthermore, the estimate for this particular project is based approximately on current rates; whereas you will no doubt appreciate that for reasons beyond your control we feel that the building works may not be put in hand until mid-1985 or later.'
When the plaintiffs' services were terminated the plaintiffs based their charges on an estimated cost of construction of $50m. At the trial the plaintiffs called expert witnesses who estimated the construction costs of the project at between $60m and $63m. The defendants however wished to tie the plaintiffs to $40m. They did not call any expert witnesses of their own to dispute the evidence of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses. It was obvious that due to the escalation of building costs there would have to be an upward revision of the estimated construction costs of the project.
There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that there was an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the construction costs of the project would be kept within the budgetary figure of $40m given by the plaintiffs to the defendants by the plaintiffs' letter of 2 May 1984. I formed the view that Alfred Chung was competent to estimate a realistic construction costs for the project at the date of the termination and notwithstanding the experts' evidence I held that a reasonable estimate for the construction costs of the project as at the date of termination was $50m.
The stage of work reached at the date of termination was hotly contested. Having already ruled that the Architect's Rules 1982 have no relevance for the purpose of determining the appropriate fee to be paid to the plaintiffs I shall determine this question by reference to the SIA conditions. For convenience I refer to the 1979 version of the SIA conditions. The relevant clauses are cll 3(ii), (iii), (iv) and (viii) which I set out below:-
Clause 3(ii)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch designs sufficient to indicate the architect's interpretation of the clients' instructions, and preparing preliminary drawings and particulars sufficient to enable applications to be made for planning approval, and for ""in principle"" approval in connection with any specific by-law, the fee shall be one-third of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(iii)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch drawings, making approximate estimates of cost by cubic measurement or otherwise and preparing sufficient drawings for the purpose of submitting to the appropriate authority to obtain building approval, the fee shall be one-half of the approximate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(iv)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch designs, making approximate estimates of cost by cubic measurement or otherwise and preparing working drawings, specification, or such other particulars as may be necessary for the preparation of bills of quantities by an independent quantity surveyor, or for the purpose of obtaining tenders, the fee shall be two- thirds of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(viii)
In cases where the architect performs partial services for any reason including the abandonment, deferment, substitution or part thereof, or if the services of the architect are terminated the fees in respect of the services put forward shall be as set down for the various stages of work as set out above.
Should the work performed fall between the stages of work set out above, then the fee chargeable shall be the percentage chargeable for the stages at the higher level.'
Written permission or `in principle approval' for the project was obtained on January 1983. Accordingly, and without dispute, the stage provided in cl 3(ii) had been fully accomplished. Furthermore the plans for obtaining building approval were at an advanced level of preparation, requiring only the preparation of elevation and section drawings. I have not lost sight of the fact that there were two sets of plans for obtaining building approval in existence, one with round columns and the other with rectangular columns. Despite this, the evidence of Von Selkey (PW-2) and Raymond Kuah (DW-2) although each gave different estimations of the work accomplished were not at variance in that the plaintiffs had qualified for their charges to be based under cl 3(iii) i.e `one-half of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost'. The question was whether the plaintiffs would qualify for charging their fees under cl 3(iv) i.e `two-thirds of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost.' Von Selkey thought so since although building approval had not yet been obtained certain building works in the nature of sheet piling had already been commenced. However in my opinion, and as I understood the evidence, the sheet piling was done to maintain the integrity of the land due to construction works on the adjoining site. In my view since the building plans had not yet been submitted for approval the plaintiffs were not quite ready to call for tenders. Hence the plaintiffs had not entered into the works specified in cl 3(iv). They were in my judgment well into the works specified in cl 3(iii) and by reason of the proviso to cl 3(viii) entitled to charge under cl 3(iii), that is to say, one-half of the agreed percentage due of the estimate cost of construction of the project.
The engineering works too were at an advanced stage at the date of termination. Both Von Selkey and Raymond Kuah agreed that the plans for roads, drains and culverts had been prepared and that they were essential for obtaining building approval. Furthermore Chung Meng Lim, the engineer in the plaintiffs, gave evidence that he was ready with the final calculations and produced them in court (Ex. P2). These calculations were for the rectangular columns. He referred to his discussion with James Chee in 1987, who was now taking more interest in the development concepts of the project, over the shape of the columns and his preparedness to round off the edges of rectangular columns to make them more circular as desired by James Chee. He also referred to an instance two months before the termination when James Chee had requested to `delete one column as the column space is money to him'. Chung Meng Lim decided to accommodate James Chee and had started working on the scheme when the plaintiffs' services were terminated.
The defendants' pleaded case was that the plans for building approval were never prepared. By insinuation the defendants were suggesting that what was produced in court as plans prepared for building approval were prepared to support the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants were never able to make good this plea. James Chee in his evidence admitted that he had seen the two sets of plans for building approval in the plaintiffs' office, his position at trial being that he did not understand the nature and impact of these plans. He feigned ignorance as to what was required for obtaining building approval after `in principle' approval had been obtained. For one who has been connected with the defendants' developments since 1974 I find this incredible. In the last resort the defendants tried to contend that the plaintiffs had proceeded to prepare plans for building approval without the authority of the defendants. I find this also incredible in view of the letters in the agreed bundles whereby the plaintiffs repeatedly informed the defendants of the progress they were making in the preparation of the plans for obtaining building approval. There are also the discussions I have referred to between Chung Meng Lim and James Chee on the configuration of the columns which can only be by reference to the plans for building approval.
The conclusion I reached was that the plaintiffs were entitled to one-half of the agreed 10% of the estimated construction costs of the project which I fixed at $50m and I gave judgment for the plaintiffs accordingly less all sums previously paid to account of the plaintiffs' fees. I also awarded the plaintiffs the costs of the action and interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the sum due to the plaintiffs from the date of the writ.",1993-11-19 00:00:00,SG High Court

C A V J u d g m e n t
The plaintiff company, incorporated in 1976 but now in liquidation, was engaged in the business of making garments. It carried on its business and production activities at its factory in Lipo Building in Aljunied Road. Mr Lee Ah Kow, who is also known as James Lee, is described in the pleadings as the company's manager, although his exact position is the subject of some quibble. The directors of the company were shown in the companies register as Mr Lee Chong Ming, who is Lee Ah Kow's brother, and Nonya Yeep, who is Lee Ah Kow's wife. I shall for convenience refer to Mr Lee Ah Kow as Mr Lee, and I shall refer to his brother, when the occasion arises, by his full name.
On the evening of 4 December 1979, there was a fire in the company's factory in Lipo Building. There is no suggestion that the fire was caused by any deliberate act of anyone.
Broadly speaking, the entire production area, which covered the major part of the premises, was practically burned out. The store room was partially affected, and fairly complete rolls of textiles can be seen in photographs. The office was not affected by the fire, although like everywhere else it had been affected by water from the firemen's hoses.
There was in force a fire insurance policy issued by the defendants on 21 November 1979 whereby the company was insured against loss and damage by fire as follows:-
(a) Machinery and equipment: $300,000 
(b) Furniture fixtures and fittings: $80,000; 
(c) Stock in trade consisting of textiles and ready-made garments: $1,500,000. 
On 11 December, the company through its solicitors made a claim for the entire sum of $1.88 million. The solicitors' letter did not set out any details of the loss. On 25 December, the details of the loss, amounting to $2.5 million were set out in a claim form and sent to the defendants. They were as follows:
(a) Machinery (details given): $300,000 
(b) Office equipment: $100,000 
(c) Cloths: $1,300,000 
(d) Ready-made garments: $800,000
The company maintained their claim to the $1.88 million limit of the policy.
By letter dated 25 January 1980, the defendants repudiated liability on the ground that when applying for insurance, the company had given untrue answers to questions concerning other insurances in force and previous fire loss.
On 10 April 1980, the company commenced action in this suit, claiming the sum of $1,880,000. The defendants raised the following defences. Firstly, they repeat the ground stated in their letter of repudiation of 25 January 1980. They say that the proposal was declared to be the basis of the contract between the company and the defendants, and the truth and accuracy of the statements in the proposal was a condition precedent to the defendants' liability under the policy. Secondly, the defendants say that the company when applying for the insurance failed to disclose the unsatisfactory financial position of the company and the fact that Mr Lee was an undischarged bankrupt. They say that these were material facts, and failure to disclose them was a breach of the conditions of the policy entitling the defendants to avoid liability.
Thirdly, the defendants say the company was in breach of a condition of the policy against fraudulent claims in that it had supported its claim by producing falsely written account books and the claim was so exaggerated as to amount to a fraudulent claim.
Fourthly, the defendants say that the company failed to produce the purchases book and this was in breach of the documentary evidence warranty clause requiring them to produce documentary evidence of the value of stocks held.
I shall deal with the fraudulent claim defence first.
The fraudulent claim defence This defence revolves mainly around the quantity of stock in trade present on the premises, and the manner in which the company, through Mr Lee, went about trying to substantiate its claim in respect of the stock in trade, i.e. $1.3m for materials and $800,000 for finished garments.
The very day after the fire, Mr Leong, the adjuster for the defendants, asked Mr Lee for the account books of the company. On 7 December, some books and documents were received, including the creditors ledger and the debtors ledger. On 12 December, some more documents were received.
Mr Leong was particularly interested in the Purchases Book. The reason is not hard to understand. The book would show the amount of stock purchased by the company and would substantiate any claim made for loss of stock in trade, which forms the bulk of the coverage of the policy; for the company, the purchases book was also an important supporting document for the claim.
Mr Leong asked for the purchases book, among other documents, in a letter to the company on 7 December. He asked for it again in his letter to the company on 12 December. He knew there was such a book because the general ledger made references to entries in it. It was not until 3 January, that a book represented as the purchases book was received from the company's solicitors.
What was provided was in fact not the original purchase book. It was the original book re-written to include some 25 invoices for purported purchases from three suppliers, i.e. Joo Fatt Textiles Co, Kong Joo & Co, and Singatrend Pte Ltd. The new entries had been inserted in accordance with the dates of the supposed invoices, and there was nothing to distinguish the original entries and the new ones.
All the invoices were of various dates in 1979 up to the end of November. There were four new entries in respect of Joo Fatt totalling some $308,000, fifteen new entries in respect of Kong Joo totalling some $962,000 and four new entries in respect of Singatrend totalling some $145,000.
The re-written purchases book was provided to Mr Leong without any indication that it was a re-written work. The original purchases book was never produced to him or to the defendants. Neither was he or the defendants told of its existence. It did not surface until 12 September 1985 when it was handed over to the police for the purpose of criminal proceedings on a cheating charge against Mr Lee for making a false insurance claim on the defendants. I would add here that the criminal proceedings resulted in Mr Lee being acquitted of the charge.
Lee's reason for re-writing the book Mr Lee knew Ricky Loh, a clerk in a law firm. It was Ricky Loh who had persuaded Mr Lee to buy the insurance from the defendants. It was also Ricky Loh who advised Mr Lee after the fire that the purchases book should be re-written to include the invoices, as otherwise there would be difficulty in claiming from the defendants. Both Mr Lee and Ricky Loh also said that the original purchases book had been damaged by water and the entries were difficult to read.
Unfortunately for Mr Lee and the company, Mr Leong, an adjuster with 30 years of experience with insurance claims, noticed that there was something wrong with the purchases book that had been given to him. None of the entries had a folio number referring to other account books where a corresponding entry would normally be made. In the case of the invoices for purchases, there would normally be corresponding entries in the creditors ledger and against each entry there would be a folio number in the purchases book referring to the appropriate folio in the creditors ledger. There would normally be similar folio number references to the purchases book in the creditors ledger. This is in accordance with the familiar double entry practice of book-keeping.
Mr Leong also noticed that there were indeed entries in the creditors ledger in the respective accounts of the three firms. However, they were all against the date 3 December 1979, although the invoices, as we now know, were of different dates from March 1979 onwards. Mr Leong also noticed that there were no folio numbers referring to the relevant folios in the purchases book.
The ""special arrangements"" The reason given by Mr Lee for the omission to enter the invoices as and when they were received was that there were special arrangements with the suppliers in regard to the payment for the materials supplied.
Mr Lee said that from the early part of 1979, the company had become very busy, having to meet increasing orders. The company made an arrangement with these 3 suppliers as follows. The suppliers would supply fabric to the company. The company would use whatever it needed. At the end of the year, account would be taken on the basis of the amount of fabric actually used. The company would pay to account of the cost of the fabric supplied as and when it was able to do so. Until account was taken, Mr Lee thought that it was not necessary to post the invoices in the purchases books. He simply put them aside. He said that was why the invoices had not been included in the purchases book as and when they were received.
It is necessary to examine the arrangement Mr Lee referred to, and form a view about them. Here, it is necessary to point out some inconsistency in Mr Lee's evidence. At first, he said that the arrangement with all 3 suppliers was the same, as described above, but later he said that the arrangement with Singatrend was different from that with Joo Fatt and Kong Joo.
The Singatrend invoices In regard to Singatrend, its director Mr Yip gave evidence that the arrangement was for Singatrend to supply the company with fabric of the colour and specifications needed for making into garments for Singatrend's customers in Europe. The company was to make garments with the fabric supplied by Singatrend. The company would charge Singatrend for the garments at prices agreed. Singatrend would invoice the company for the fabric supplied, and the company would subsequently invoice Singatrend for the cost of the finished garments. If any fabric was not used, it could be returned, or retained by the company for fresh orders of garments from Singatrend. So the arrangement was basically for the two parties to invoice each other for goods supplied, raw material on the one hand and finished garments on the other.
Mr Yip said that the garments to be made from the fabric supplied under the four Singatrend invoices had in fact been completed the day before the fire, and he had arranged for a cargo container to be sent to the Lipo factory to collect them. The container was waiting to load, but the fire put an end to that. Singatrend eventually had the company wound up for failure to settle its debt to Singatrend.
Mr Yip struck me as an honest witness. I accept what he said. I think there is little question about the transactions evidenced in the four Singatrend invoices being arms' length.
The Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices The Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices, however, appear to raise serious questions. They were for much larger amounts, the two sets together accounting for some $1.27m.
According to Mr Lee, Joo Fatt and Kong Joo were willing to deal with the company on the special arrangement he mentioned because Mr Lee's brother-in-law from Hong Kong, who was a well-to-do entrepreneur, had met the proprietors of Joo Fatt and Kong Joo and had verbally given them a guarantee for what they supplied to the company. In Kong Joo's case, a guarantee of up to $500,000 was given by the brother-in-law.
The proprietor of Kong Joo, Mr Tan, was called. He was a most reluctant and unsatisfactory witness. It was only under some pressure that he came out in support of what Mr Lee had said about the special arrangement.
Mr Tan, then aged 29, was assisting his parents, who were the real owners of Kong Joo. The parents, incidentally, were not called. According to Mr Tan, he decided on his own to extend the credit to the company. It was his own judgment that the company was doing well, the factory was busy, and furthermore he had the verbal guarantee of Mr Lee's brother-in-law to the amount of $500,000. I have to form a view as to how much one could give to the evidence about the special arrangement.
The account between the company and Kong Joo shows that as of 1 March 1979, the company was indebted to Kong Joo to the tune of $124,000. It is not known how long this had been outstanding. Between then and the end of November, various sums totalling some $45,000 were paid, leaving some $79,000 still outstanding at the end of November. The payments were all in small amounts, a few thousand dollars each. There was, however, a payment, or rather an attempted payment, of $20,000 made on 13 September by a cheque drawn on the company's account. Apparently this was dishonoured, and on 1 October, a payment of that amount was made by a cheque drawn on Mr Lee Chong Ming's personal account. Mr O'Dea, an accountant called by the defence, said that a likely explanation for the money to be paid from Mr Lee Chong Ming direct to the creditor instead of into the company's bank account first and then for Kong Joo to be paid from the company's bank account, was to ensure that, in a situation where there were insufficient funds to meet all cheques issued, Kong Joo would be paid. This, according to him, indicated some pressure on the company to pay Kong Joo.
The account clearly suggests difficulty on the part of the company in paying Kong Joo.
Mr Tan said that the materials which he supplied to the company were bought from Kong Joo's suppliers on facilities extended by Kong Joo's bankers. Kong Joo no doubt had to pay interest to the bank, and to shoulder the cost of financing these large purchases.
I ask myself why any business concern would supply the company with nearly $1 million worth of materials on indefinite credit when the company had been so slow in paying for past supplies. Why would any business concern carry on its business in such a self-sacrificing manner? I cannot see anything in this arrangement for Kong Joo.
A major difficulty with Mr Tan's evidence is that apart from the invoices themselves, there is nothing in the documents to support what on the face of it is quite an incredible tale. In normal circumstances, one would give allowance to the unavailability of documents after so many years. However, in this case it is not so much the fact that supporting documents are not available, as the attitude of Mr Tan to the matter. When he was asked to show bank statements of the banks which he said had given Kong Joo credit facilities, he naturally enough said they were no longer available after so many years. But when he was pressed as to whether he would agree to ask the banks to supply copies now, he adamantly refused, and for no apparent reason broke down on the witness stand.
The invoice book from which these particular invoices were purportedly issued was not produced. The reason given by Mr Tan was that they had been damaged by rain, and, then on further probing by counsel, that they had been thrown away. Without the invoice book, of course, one avenue of testing the authenticity of the invoices in question was closed.
It is unfortunate that the boss of Joo Fatt, Mr Chiang has since died and is no longer available as a witness. But there is uncontroverted evidence which raises doubts about the assertion of Joo Fatt having supplied fabric to the amount of the 4 invoices. As of 1 March 1979, the company owed Joo Fatt nearly $45,000. There were some small transactions in the month of March, which brought the balance to the figure of $47,181.03. Without counting the four invoices in question in this suit, that figure remained right through to 24 November, when a sum of $5000 was paid. In other words, no substantial payment had been made by the company towards reduction of the amount outstanding for at least eight months. The details of the 4 invoices in question are as follows:

As in the case of Kong Joo, the question arises why Joo Fatt should supply goods worth over $300,000 to a company which had not made any substantial effort to reduce a relatively small outstanding balance for so long.
In regard to both the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices, I am rather sceptical about the existence of any guarantee worth its name said to have been given by Mr Lee's brother-in-law. I accept that Mr Lee has a brother-in-law in Hong Kong, since he is very firm in his evidence about this and of course he should know. But apart from that, I find it rather strange that both Mr Tan and Mr Chiang as businessmen would place any reliance on the alleged guarantee given by Mr Lee's brother-in-law. Although they might not know that an oral guarantee is worth nothing in law, I am sure as lay businessmen using their native intelligence and common sense they would not put much weight on the verbal assurance of someone living in another country who only visited Singapore occasionally. It must also be noted that Kong Joo made no demands or requests for payment from the alleged guarantor when the company was not able to pay and he took out a writ against the company. There is also no evidence that Joo Fatt took any action to recover the debt either from the company or from the alleged guarantor.
I think the suggestion of a guarantee adds nothing to the company's case in relation to these invoices from Joo Fatt and Kong Joo. It only makes it all the more incredible. I would add that I do not, in the circumstances, attach much weight to the fact that Kong Joo took out a writ for the amount of the invoices, or the fact that they filed a proof for it with the Official Receiver when the company was wound up.
Other missing documents Now, to return to the company and Mr Lee, no proper stock book showing the movements of stock is available. Mr Lee said that such a stock book had been kept, but it was lost in the fire. There is therefore no direct evidence of the amount of the stock on the premises at the time of the fire. This is the company's fault, as by the documentary evidence warranty clause, it was obliged to keep a stock book and safeguard it against fire.
I must mention in this connection that all the account books for the two financial years commencing 1 March 1977 and 1988, according to Mr Lee, had been burnt in the fire. He said that unlike the 1979 books, they were not stored in the office but in the store room. This explanation should not be accepted unquestioningly. Firstly, it would appear that there was not much burning in the store room. Mr Leong said in his first report that the store was only partially affected by the fire. His photographs of the store room also show that the textiles stored there remained largely intact, except for damage by water from the fire fighting.
Secondly, I do not see any reason why being a young company with only a limited amount of account books there should be any need to move the previous years' account books from the fairly sizeable office (see Mr Leong's sketch plan) to a store room for raw materials at the far end of the premises from the office and presumably freely accessible to the company's production workers. I do not think that Mr Lee has told me the truth or the whole truth about the whereabouts of these previous years' account books or what happened to them. I think he chose to produce the 1979 account books as they contain entries which he thought would help his insurance claims. One thing these previous account books would have shown for present purposes was how well or how badly the company had managed its account with Joo Fatt and Kong Joo. As it is, all that we have are the opening balances at the beginning of the financial year, 1 March 1979, but not how long these debit balances had been outstanding. Such information would obviously be of help when considering the assertion that the two suppliers agreed to entrust the company with such large quantities of goods on such favourable terms. Not that the company's conduct of the accounts with these suppliers in 1979 alone is not enough to give one a fair picture.
The accountant's report In support of the company's claim, a report made by a firm of accountants Cheong Khee San & Co was produced.
This report was prepared only in October, 1992. It was based on the audited accounts of the company for the 3 financial years from 1.3.1976 to 28.2.1979, and the account books and documents produced in this suit.
The main object of the exercise was to estimate the amount of the stock as at the date of the fire. Mr Cheong came to a figure of $262,860 for raw materials and $1,357,399 for finished goods.
The value of this report is limited by the fact that not all the books and documents which were required were produced to the accountant. The report was made under what was known as SAP 14 rules. The witness agreed that if the data that were given to him were flawed the result would also be flawed. It was frankly not an audit.
Mr Cheong based his calculations on the amount of purchases which include the purchases subject of the disputed invoices. His estimates therefore stand or fall with those invoices.
Loss of machinery and equipment claim: the Hiap Foh fiasco
The company's creditors ledger shows a balance of $6393.55 due to Hiap Foh Industrial Sewing Machine Co. as of 30 November, 1979. Below the line showing the opening balance of that figure at 1 December, there is a clutch of seven entries of invoices with dates from 24 March to 3 December 1979, totalling $303,626.61. Then after the last invoice entry, there is an adjustment debiting Hiap Foh with the same figure of $303,626.61, thus reducing the outstanding amount due to Hiap Foh to the original $6,393.55.
Asked to explain what the seven invoices were for, Mr Lee said that they were for the supply of sewing machines. He said the machines were not necessarily bought in 1979; some of them might have been bought in 1977 or 1978. Asked for the reason for the adjustment, Mr Lee said that the machines had been paid for but Hiap Foh probably challenged that. The book-keeper must have dug out the old invoices and then made the entries. He said when Hiap Foh was convinced that the invoices had indeed been paid, the book-keeper then made the adjustment entry to reverse the entries so as to show that indeed the company only owed Hiap Foh the small amount of $6,393.55.
This version of how the entries came to be made was given in quite clear terms when Mr Lee was cross-examined on 6 November 1992. However, in re-examination on 19 April, 1993, Mr Lee said that the ""invoices"" were not actually invoices; they were what he called pro forma invoices, they were quotations for machines which Hiap Foh had given the company for approval. In fact, now said Mr Lee, the machines shown in these pro forma invoices had not been bought; the company had merely intended to buy them later in 1980.
The proprietor of Hiap Foh was called, but he could not substantiate even the pro forma invoices story.
The simple truth about these invoices came to light when Mr Leong, the defendants' adjuster, showed to the court that these invoices were none other than seven of the disputed Kong Joo invoices for fabric allegedly supplied by Kong Joo. They had nothing to do with sewing machines. They were simply entered in this part of the creditors ledger as a result of an obvious mistake on the part of whoever had been doing the entries. That was why they had to be adjusted. I have more to say later about Mr Lee's performance in the witness box in regard to this matter.
Fraudulent claims : The burden of proof The relevant condition of the policy on fraudulent claims is condition 13. It provides:
""13. If the claim be in any respect fraudulent or if any false declaration be made or used in support thereof, or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the Insured or any one acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under this Policy; ... all benefit under this Policy shall be forfeited.""
The burden is on the defendants to make good their defence that the company had made a fraudulent claim.
The standard of proof is a high one, but I do not think I have to apply the criminal law standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I am content to rely on what Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal case of Bater v Bater < 1951 > P 35 said:
""A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require for itself a higher degree of probability than that which it would require when asking if negligence is established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature; but still it does require a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion""
This statement was referred to with approval in the subsequent Court of Appeal case of Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd < 1957 > 1 Q B 247.
The High Court in this country has also approached the matter in the manner indicated by Lord Denning. See Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij N.V. v Koh Kim Guan < 1959 > 25 M L J 173 (Rose C J). See also Eastern Enterprises Ltd v Ong Choo Kim < 1969 > 1 M L J 236, and the very helpful analysis of the cases there by Winslow J.
Fraudulent claim: my findings
Applying the high standard of proof which should be applied, I am quite satisfied that for the reasons I have already indicated, the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices are not what they purport to be. I am satisfied that neither Joo Fatt nor Kong Joo supplied the goods described in any of these invoices.
Mr Lee's conduct in relation to the production of the purchases book has all the manifestations of a man who knew he was doing something he ought not to do. He could easily have produced the original purchases book straightaway and explained why the invoices had not been entered. He did not do so; he concealed the existence of the book. He had it re-written to include the invoices in such a way as to show that they had been entered in their proper date sequence. He then presented the re-written book without saying a word about the original. The fact that he relied on the dubious advice of a solicitors' clerk does not make the act any the less his own.
I reject his explanation that the book had been damaged by water and the entries were hard to read. I have seen the original book. It is on the whole quite intact. The person who did the re-writing must have been able to read all the entries to produce a re-written book which, it is agreed, was a complete and accurate reproduction of the old (save for the additions of the invoices in question).
It was on any view a clumsy and futile way of going about it. The way the rewriting was done, with the conspicuous omission of the folio numbers, made it easy for any person with any experience of reading account books to see that there was something amiss, all the more so as the creditors ledger and debtors ledger which Mr Lee had given to Mr Leong just after the fire had all the entries of these invoices made, not in date sequence but all in one block at the end of the last page.
One is tempted to ask, but perhaps only to be meticulously fair to Mr Lee: if a claim is made in such a clumsy and transparently false manner, can it be fraudulent? Is it more the work of a fool than that of a knave? I think the circumstances of this case, particularly the surreptitiousness of Mr Lee's conduct, compel one to take the less charitable view.
I think I am also justified in taking into account Mr Lee's attempt to mislead the court in regard to the invoices attributed to Hiap Foh. A mistake is excusable, but in this instance it was more than a mistake. Mr Lee had, tried when giving evidence to rely on these entries in support of his claim for the loss of $300,000 worth of sewing machines and equipment. The figure of $303,626.61 fits almost exactly the amount of the insurance coverage for machinery and equipment and the amount of the company's claim in respect of that item. I think it was only when he found out later that the proprietor of Hiap Foh was not going to support him that he tried to contain the damage by saying something different, in re-examination.
I therefore reach the conclusion that the company as the insured had used fraudulent means in connection with their claim. I also reach the conclusion that the claim was so exaggerated as to amount on that ground a fraudulent claim. Although the company no doubt sustained losses, it is precluded from these facts from recovering any of the losses. This is the result at law, and it is also a result provided in condition 13 of the policy.
Fire expert's report Before I leave the subject, I ought to mention one matter.
On the very last day of the hearing, 26 April, 1993, the defence put Mr Dillon, a fire expert, on the witness stand. He had visited the premises earlier in the year, he was not able to recall when. He had prepared a report dated 9 April 1993, but because of his illness, it was only sent to the defendants' solicitors by courier on 22 April.
It was his opinion, based on an analysis of data from the adjusters' reports, that the company would not have had the amount of stock it claimed to have lost.
Mr Dillon has extensive experience in fire investigations and was an impressive witness. However, because the report was made available so late in the day, I have the distinct impression that the basis of his findings was not as well explored as one would have wished, despite the valiant attempts of the company's counsel.
I simply do not know why expert evidence could not have been obtained earlier. Springing an expert at the last moment is not what one might consider to be the best way of assisting the court. Although Mr Dillon's evidence, so far as it goes, seems to make sense, I am rather wary of accepting it all on face value.
Breach of basis of contract clause: amount of other insurances
The company signed a declaration at the foot of the proposal form warranting that the particulars of the proposal were true and that the proposal should be the basis of the contract between the company and the defendants. In the proposal form, in answer to the question ""Are there any insurances on the same property in force with this or other insurance companies?"", the company had stated ""Yes. QBE $500,000"".
The answer had appeared in a proposal form dated 12 November 1979, but because of a mistake related to the description of the property insured, a revised form was prepared and signed by Mr Lee on 14 November.
The facts about other insurances are as follows. On either date when Mr Lee signed the form, there were in force two fire policies issued by QBE Insurance Ltd., one for $100,000 and another for $73,260, taken out in February and September 1979 respectively, both for a one-year term.
Previous to this, on 5 November, Mr Lee had signed two further proposals for insurance with QBE, one for a fire policy for the sum of $820,000 and another for a consequential loss policy for the sum of $860,000.
The answer of ""QBE $500,000"" did not square with any of the above figures, or any combination of them.
It is not disputed that the answer was filled in by the defendants' agent Mr Wan. Mr Lee explained that what he told Mr Wan the agent was that he was applying to increase the QBE policy by at least another $500,000; it would be between $500,000 and $1 million. He also gave evidence that the two policies which he had applied for on 5 November were not issued to him until 25 or 26 November, so until then he did not know whether the proposals would be approved or how much they would be approved for. It is not disputed that the then existing QBE fire policies and the proposed QBE fire policy all covered or would cover the same property as the policy being applied for from the defendants. It is also clear, without making too fine a point of it, that the consequential loss policy applied for would cover loss consequent on the destruction or damage by fire of largely the same property.
I find Mr Lee's explanations quite difficult to follow, having regard to the very clear terms of the question asked.
Mr Wan, the defendants' agent, told me in effect, and I see no reason not to believe him, that he had got a straight answer to a straight question, and he included it in the proposal form for Mr Lee to sign. Mr Lee admitted that he had read through the completed form, albeit quickly, before signing it.
It seems to be contended by the defendants that the company should have disclosed the two existing policies as well as the two proposed. Counsel did not however address the law on the subject. It seems to me, however, that the principle to be applied is that of strict compliance. Just as the proposed assured has to be exact in his answer to a question, he is not to be faulted if he gives an answer exactly according to the terms of the question asked. The learned authors of MacGillivray and Parkington on Insurance Law, 7th ed, at para. 725, citing authorities, say:
725. General rule. It has always been the law since Lord Mansfield's day that there must be strict and exact compliance with the obligation or statement which is warranted, so that, as he himself said in Pawson v. Watson, ""Nothing tantamount will do or answer the purpose.""
They also say at para. 727 : 727. Exact compliance sufficient. The rule of strict compliance demands only an exact performance of the warranty or condition, and the insurer is not permitted to say that it was in the power of the assured to do more to comply with the warranty than he did, if what he did was an exact compliance.
If I am right, the position is this. The company was not required by the terms of the question to refer to the two proposed policies. However, the company had to answer exactly the question that was put. It should have referred to the two existing fire policies with QBE. The answer that it in fact gave was not the true answer the company by the signed declaration warranted it to be. The defendants are therefore entitled to repudiate on this ground. See Allen v. Universal Automobile Ins. Co < 1933 > 45 Ll. l. R 55 and other cases cited in MacGillivray et al., loc. cit.
I do not have to consider whether, independently of the question posed in the proposal form, there was any duty to disclose the proposed insurances with QBE. In closing submission, counsel made references to condition 3 of the policy requiring notification of insurances subsequently effected on pain of forfeiture of all benefit under the policy. As counsel for the company pointed out, this was never pleaded. I do not see why, particularly in a matter involving such serious consequences, I should allow the defendants to raise the point in such a fashion.
Breach of basis of contract clause : Previous fire
In answer to the question ""Have you ever suffered loss by fire?"" the company had stated ""No"".
In April 1979 there had been a fire at the company's premises at North Bridge Road. It recovered some $20,000 on a fire policy issued by QBE. Mr Lee said that he did mention this to Mr Wan but Mr Wan told him that he was only interested in any previous fires at the Lipo factory. I do not think this is likely. Mr Lee had just days before signed the proposal for the $820,000 fire policy to QBE in which a similar question (though slightly differently worded) was asked and the answer filled in for him by the QBE agent was ""Yes, please refer to claim department"". He must have known that this referred to the North Bridge Road fire. When answering the question in the defendants' proposal form it is highly unlikely that he would have thought that the insurers were only interested in previous fires at the Lipo factory, rather than any previous fire experience of the company as a whole.
Mr Wan said that he simply asked Mr Lee whether the company had had a fire previously and Mr Lee said no. I accept Mr Wan's evidence.
The untrue answer given to the question entitles the defendants to repudiate for the same reasons which apply to the question about other insurances dealt with above.
Breach of the documentary evidence warranty The relevant part of the documentary evidence warranty endorsed on the policy reads as follows:
""It is warranted during the currency of this Policy and is a condition precedent to any liability of the Company hereunder:-
(a) That in the event of a claim for loss arising under this Policy it is warranted by the Assured that they will produce Documentary Evidence in English of the amount of value of the stocks held immediately prior to the happening of the loss.""
The defendants plead in their re-amended defence that the failure to produce the original purchases book when requested constitutes a breach of this warranty. There has been no answer to this plea. Although the matter was not fully argued as to the law, I am prepared to uphold the defendants' plea. When the warranty speaks of evidence, it must, I am sure, be implied that it is evidence that has come into existence in regular course or any secondary compilation based on such evidence. As I have found that the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices are not genuine invoices, it follows that the re-written purchases book cannot constitute evidence contemplated by this warranty.
Material non-disclosures: Lee's bankruptcy It is of course no crime to be a bankrupt. Plenty of perfectly honest people end up in the bankruptcy courts. However, the fact that the person having management responsibilities of a company is an undischarged bankrupt is something which an insurer is entitled to be told, so that they can assess the moral hazard involved and their risk under any insurance proposed. Although there has been a great deal of argument about the exact position of Mr Lee in the company, it seems clear that he held at least some management responsibility. He was also in charge of all insurance matters for the company. The company's reply to defence in fact describes him as the manager of the company. In evidence, Mr Lee sometimes described himself as the manager of the company and sometimes he insisted that he was only the manager of the Lipo factory.
I am of the view that the failure to disclose the fact of Mr Lee's status as an undischarged bankrupt was a material non-disclosure entitling the insurers to avoid.
As for the financial position of the company, I do not think it was such that it was incumbent on the company to disclose it. True it is that the company's financial position was not very healthy, being a young company, but it did manage to carry on as a going concern. It is nothing like the position of the assured in, for instance, Teh Say Cheng v North British Mercantile Ltd < 1921 > F M S L R 248, where there was an unsatisfied judgment..
Conclusion I therefore dismiss the company's claim with costs. I order that the amounts deposited as security for costs be released to the defendants' solicitors to be held to account of the defendants' costs.",1993-05-05 00:00:00,SG High Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
Synopsis
The accused Tan Nguan Siah who was 38 years of age at the time of his arrest was tried before me initially on the following charge:
That you, TAN NGUAN SIAH, on or about the 5th day of March 1991 at about 5.05 pm at Changi Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, 118 packets of substance containing not less than 46.56 grams of diamorphine which were in your possession at Changi Road, Singapore, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby, by virtue of section 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, committed an offence under section 5(a) and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
2 The accused did not deny having the prohibited substance in his possession but claimed in the main that except for four packets < which contained about 1.92g of diamorphine > which were meant for sale that evening, the remainder was for his consumption. He maintained that out of the 118 packets seized from him, 62 packets < containing 29.47g of diamorphine > were bought by him just that evening from one of his contacts for his personal consumption. He claimed that he was an addict and it was his habit to carry the drugs around since the rented room he was occupying was not a safe place to store those drugs.
3 At the close of the whole case the learned DPP applied to amend the charge by which the amount of diamorphine said to be trafficked in was reduced from 46.56 to 46.43g and correspondingly the number of packets was also reduced from 118 to 117 packets. < Emphasis added. > All other features of the charge remained unaltered. There was no objection to the proposed amendment and there was no application for any witnesses to be recalled. In the event, the accused was found guilty of the amended charge and was sentenced to death. My reasons follow.
Prosecution evidence
4 The prosecution's case was that on 5 March 1991 at about 5.05pm, the accused was seen standing with a black plastic bag at a bus stop along Changi Road. PC Zakaria Bin Ahmad (PW-10) who was patrolling that sector in a police patrol car with National Service Police Inspector (NSPI) Ang Thiam Soon (PW-9) and Corporal Panneerchelvam s/o Solomon (PW-11) stopped the vehicle and checked the accused. The plastic bag the accused carried contained a substantial sum of money and numerous packets of white powdery substance which PC Zakaria suspected as heroin. On examination the contents of the plastic bag revealed:
(1) A Marlboro cigarette box wrapped with Chinese newspaper containing 62 packets of white powdery substance; 
(2) S$6,200;
(3) Red coloured plastic bag (Ming Ming Optical Co); 
(4) Red coloured paper bag (Bee Cheng Hiang Hup Chong Foodstuff Pte Ltd); 
(5) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 8 packets of white powdery substance;
(6) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 14 packets of white powdery substance; 
(7) 1 red polythene bag containing 29 packets of white powdery substance; and 
(8) 1 newspaper-wrapped bundle containing 4 packets of white powdery substance.
In addition to the above the accused also had in his shirt pocket 1 `ang pow' packet containing a packet of white powdery substance, a stick and an empty straw.
5 The accused was eventually brought to Geylang Police Station where he was questioned by SNO Chow Toong Chee (PW-12) as to the contents of the plastic bag. The accused admitted that the bag contained `Peh Hoon' which is the Hokkien equivalent for heroin.
6 All the 118 packets of the white powdery substance were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and the certificates (six in number) issued by Dr Saw Chwee Guan, established that the powdery substance contained a total of 46.56g of diamorphine. The breakdown according to the said six certificates is as follows:

7 NSPI Ang whose depositional evidence was admitted as PS-22 without objection gave oral testimony. He said that when the accused was picked up at Changi Road, he was brought into the rear seat of the police vehicle and was questioned by PC Zakaria. NSPI Ang said that he acted as an interpreter and interpreted to the accused in Hokkien the questions that were put to the accused by PC Zakaria and the replies given by the accused were in turn interpreted in English by him to PC Zakaria. NSPI Ang said that he did not record those questions and answers in his pocket book.
8 It should be observed at this juncture that before the above verbal questions and answers were admitted in evidence, the Court invited the DPP to submit as to whether such verbals were admissible in evidence for it appeared on the face of it that the person who asked the questions and obtained the answers was PC Zakaria who was an officer below the rank of a Sergeant. The DPP then addressed the Court on the wording of s 122(5) of the CPC which amongst other things provided that any statement (by an accused) `in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of Sergeant shall be admissible at his trial.' He said that since NSPI Ang who acted as the interpreter is a police officer above the rank of a Sergeant such statements given in his hearing were admissible. Defence counsel did not join issue with the DPP's submissions based on s 122(5) of the CPC. The verbals thus admitted as part of NSPI Ang's deposition read as follows:
Q : Whether he was the seller or buyer?
A : Seller. 
Q : Where he got the drug?
A : From a Malaysian.
Q : What is the Malaysian's name?
A : Don't know. 
Q : Selling to who?
A : Sell to whoever called me. 
Q : Where he got the money from? 
A : From the sale of the drug.
9 NSPI Ang was cross-examined fairly intensively. It was suggested to him that the five questions and answers were part of a larger conversation that took place that day. NSPI Ang agreed with that suggestion. He also admitted that he did not at the time of questioning realise the significance of the questions and answers and therefore it did not occur to him to have them recorded. He conceded that he could not remember the actual words employed when questioning the accused and the words used by the accused in giving his answers. Neither could he remember the actual sequence. He maintained however that he could recall the said questions and answers some 13 days later when he was interviewed by the Investigating Officer, NO Soh Koh Tong (PW-13) in the recording of his statement.
10 NO Soh's evidence, quite apart from its formal aspects, touched upon the raid conducted by his team of officers at about 6.15pm on 7 March 1991 on the accused's rented room at No 16 Geylang Lorong 38. There he seized a small cardboard box (marked `physeptone') containing two packets (sachets) of granular substance and the identity card of the accused. The raiding party also discovered a bundle of empty plastic packets (exh P-48). NO Soh also said in evidence that when the accused was under his charge between 6 and 20 March 1991 the accused never complained to him of any illness or discomfort and had that been the case he would have sent the accused to Changi Prison Hospital for treatment.
11 No Soh confirmed that the two urine samples taken from the accused after his arrest proved to be positive in that morphine was detected.
Submission of no case to answer
12 At the close of the prosecution's case counsel submitted that the prosecution had not made out a case against the accused. He contended that the presumption contained in s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Ch 185) (`the Act') is a rebuttable one. The mainstay of his submission was that trafficking was an overt act and the prosecution, inasmuch as it had omitted to prove any overt act on the part of the accused, had failed to establish an essential ingredient of the charge. In this regard counsel relied on Seow Koon Guan v Public Prosecutor < 1978 > 2 MLJ 45 which, counsel submitted, supported his proposition that mere possession of a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking therein did not constitute the doing of an act for the purpose of trafficking therein.
Reply by DPP at the close of prosecution case
13 The DPP in her reply submitted that the prosecution had proved that the accused was in possession of 46.56g of diamorphine and by virtue of s 18(2) of the Act, the accused was deemed to have known the nature of the drug. The DPP added that the fact of possession having been proved, s 17 of the Act which is averred to in the charge, came into play and the accused is presumed to be trafficking in diamorphine.
Prima facie case
14 Section 17 of the Act in its present form contains an amendment to the old law and came into effect on 15 February 1990. It reads:
17. Any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than - 
(a) 100 grammes of opium;
(b) 3 grammes of morphine; 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine; 
(d) 15 grammes of cannabis;
(e) 10 grammes of cannabis resin; or (f) 3 grammes of cocaine, whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug.
The amendment introduces a rebuttable presumption concerning trafficking in a number of controlled drugs under which anyone who is proved to be in possession of more than a stipulated quantity shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that drug. The amendment was clearly intended to overcome the shortcomings highlighted in the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Poon Soh Har & Anor v Public Prosecutor < 1977 > 2 MLJ 126 where Choor Singh J observed at page 128:
It seems to us that the trial judges equated the phrase ""have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking"" in section 15 of the Act with the word ""traffic"". To possess a drug for the purpose of trafficking therein, is, as already pointed out, something totally different from the act of ""trafficking"" as defined in section 2 of the Act. In our judgment the words of section 15 are clear and unambiguous. If Parliament had intended that the presumption should be that the possessor was trafficking in the drug possessed, it would have used the words ""traffic in such controlled drug"" instead of the words ""have had such controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking."" < Emphasis added. > 
15 The phraseology of the amended s 17 of the Act is unambiguous and in fact requires no legislative history to interpret its meaning and purport. It provides that once a person is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have trafficked in a controlled drug. The presumption itself is well justified on the ground that the harm and damage caused by purveyors of drugs is so great and proof of trafficking so difficult to establish that the law must shift the burden to the accused (see Evidence by Prof Chin Tet Yung at page 150). The phrase `until the contrary is proved' appearing in s 17 of the Act shifts the burden to the accused to prove on balance of probabilities that he was not trafficking in diamorphine. It is therefore in my view unnecessary to prove any overt act on the part of the accused person. The reliance on Seow Koon Guan's case (supra) by counsel was therefore misplaced in view of the 1990 amendments to s 17 of the Act. Having therefore considered all the undisputed evidence, I held that a case had been made out by the prosecution which, if unrebutted, would warrant the conviction of the accused. The standard allocution was administered and the accused elected to give evidence on affirmation.
Defence evidence
16 The main aspects of the accused's evidence are these. The accused was a drug addict. He was detained at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) in 1978 and was placed under police supervision in September 1990. Just about ten days after his release in September 1990 he started consuming heroin.
17 At the initial stages, his consumption was only half a small packet of heroin a day but as days went by he increased his consumption to two packets a day.
18 Prior to his arrest he was staying in a rented room in Geylang. At the time of his arrest he was employed at a gambling den, earning about $80 to $100 a day. He also made money by gambling and from his earnings spent between $70 and $80 a day on heroin. He admitted carrying the drugs in the plastic bag found in his possession on 5 March 1991. Of the drugs found, 62 packets were bought by him from a Malaysian by the name of Ah Lee just minutes prior to his arrest on 5 March 1991. He paid $5,000 for those drugs. This sum of $5,000 came partly from his savings, partly from monies he had won at gambling sessions and partly from the sale of drugs by him to others. He emphasised that whatever sale he had made in the past did not at any given time exceed four packets.
19 On the day and time of his arrest, he was waiting at the bus stop to sell four packets of heroin to a person whom he knew as Ang but before he could meet up with Ang, he was arrested.
20 He asserted that out of the 118 packets found on him, 62 packets were fresh purchases, one for his consumption and four for sale. He carried the remainder in the bay because the rented room where he slept was not a safe place to store them since his landlady had a key to that room. Furthermore the room had no other furniture apart from the beddings and an electric fan.
21 As to the sum of $6,200 found inside the bag, the accused claimed that sum was borrowed by him from people at the gambling den to meet the funeral expenses of his sister who had passed away on 4 March 1991. Another sum of $1,600 that was also found on him was attributed by him to be a repayment of a loan by one of his friends. As to the other sums found with him, he accounted that a sum of $296 was the balance of monies after he had paid off Ah Lee for the 62 packets of heroin; a sum of M$200 was won by him at a gambling session and a 10,000 Japanese Yen note was acquired by him from someone sometime ago.
22 He said that after his arrest at Changi Road he was questioned in Malay by a Malay police officer (referring to PC Zakaria). The questions were in relation to his identity card and as to the contents of the plastic bag. He could not recall what was asked but was certain that he was not asked whether he was a seller or a buyer. He was also not asked as to where he obtained the money from. He claimed that the Chinese police officer (referring to NSPI Ang) did not ask him any questions.
23 A statement given by the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Ch 68) to NO Soh was tendered by him in evidence. The statement thus admitted (exh D-5) reads as follows: The heroin was for my own consumption and I also sell heroin to sustain my drug addiction. I plead for leniency. (signed) (signed) (signed)
He asserted that though he sold drugs, he had never done so in large quantities and never exceeded 15g at any given time as he knew that such sale attracted the death penalty. He claimed that he made $40 to $50 profit from the sale of one packet.
24 In cross-examination the accused said that prior to his arrest he used to smoke more than 30 sticks of cigarettes spiked with heroin each day. The amount of drugs used to spike those 30 sticks was about two packets. He claimed that he was an addict and needed to smoke heroin constantly otherwise he would suffer from withdrawal symptoms. He explained that if he did not consume the next stick of heroin within an hour he would feel cold; if there was no consumption for two hours he would have cold sweat and running nose; if there was an interval of ten hours, he would feel weak, have cold sweat, running nose and feel feverish; and if there was no consumption for 20 hours he would suffer additionally stomach ache, feel weak and have diarrhoea. He added that if no heroin was available he would resort to a pill sold in dispensaries for some provisional comfort.
25 He said that after his arrest when he was sent to the lock-up he had all the symptoms which he described. But when he requested the CNB officers to send him to the Changi Prison Hospital, he was told that his stay at that hospital would result in his being handcuffed to the bed - a thought which dissuaded him from pursuing his request. He asserted that he had witnesses to confirm his withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up. He claimed that the officer who mentioned handcuffing was known to him as one `Loh Kok Wah'.
26 When pressed in cross-examination as to the identity of the CNB officer who mentioned the aspect of handcuffing at Changi Prison Hospital, the accused mentioned the name of NO Soh and after some uncertainty, pointed to Tan Geck Hong (PW-6) as one of the persons. A recurring element in his defence was that he was a drug addict and the drug found in his possession on that day was substantially for his consumption save for four packets which he was going to dispose of that day. The accused admitted that the bundle of empty plastic packets (exh P-48) found in his room were meant to be used for repacking the drugs into smaller packets.
27 A number of witnesses were called by the defence to substantiate that the accused was a drug addict. Dr Leow Kee Fong (DW-2) confirmed that the accused was detained at the DRC first in April 1978 and later in April and September 1979. Dr Leow confirmed that the withdrawal symptoms an addict would suffer include yawning, tearing, running nose, insomnia, cold sweat, stomach cramps, vomitting and diarrhoea.
28 Dr Lee Tong Kooi (DW-3) a Scientific Officer from the Department of Scientific Services testified that the analysis of the urine sample taken from the accused showed that it was consistent with the accused having consumed diamorphine.
29 Dr Chui Wai Yee (DW-4) another Scientific Officer attached to the Department of Scientific Services also testified that her analysis too confirmed that the urine sample of the accused contained morphine.
30 Tan Song Chua (DW-5), the brother of the accused testified to the effect that he suspected the accused of having resumed the consumption of heroin after his release from detention.
31 The other witnesses Chin Mun Wah (DW-6), Ong Cheng Chua (DW-7) and Yeoh Tiong Ghee (DW-8) all testified that the accused appeared to have been suffering from withdrawal symptoms when he was brought into the lock-up in March 1991.
32 Tan Geck Hong was recalled by the prosecution to give evidence in rebuttal. He denied that the accused told him of his withdrawal symptoms. He further denied that he told the accused that he would be handcuffed at the Changi Prison Hospital.
Closing submission by the defence
33 Mr Ang for the accused in his closing submission urged the Court to accept the accused's evidence that though he was in possession of 118 packets of drugs containing 46.56g of diamorphine, 62 packets which contained 29.47g of diamorphine were bought for his consumption only five minutes prior to his arrest. Of the balance, one packet which was in a red `ang pow' packet found in the shirt pocket of the accused containing 0.13g of diamorphine together with a straw and a stick was for the accused's own consumption. From the remainder, ie, 55 packets containing 16.96g of diamorphine, four packets (P-15/B4A) amounting to 1.92g were for sale to one Ang that day. Counsel submitted that it was beyond dispute that the accused was a drug addict having been detained at the DRC on a number of occasions. This was further fortified by the fact that the urine samples taken from him immediately after his arrest revealed traces of morphine. He added that the drug addiction of the accused was substantial to the point that he was suffering from acute withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up as had been confirmed by a number of inmates. Counsel also placed reliance on the s 122(6) statement of the accused in which he had stated that the heroin found in the plastic bag was meant for his own consumption and that he sold the heroin to sustain his drug addiction.
34 Counsel invited the Court to disregard the evidence of NSPI Ang as respects a number of questions posed by him at the behest of PC Zakaria and the purported answers from the accused. The attack on the verbals was on two fronts. Firstly counsel submitted that those verbals were not arranged in sequence and therefore gave a wrong flavour of the answers given. Secondly that those questions and answers were not promptly recorded by NSPI Ang after the occurrence but were narrated by him 13 days later.
35 As to the substantial sums of money found in the accused's possession, counsel's submission was that of the sum found, $6,200 could be clearly attributed to the accused borrowing money on account of his sister's funeral. In this regard, he relied on the evidence of his brother, Tan Song Chua who said that the accused had earlier told him that he was going to borrow some money for his sister's funeral.
36 Counsel contended that inasmuch as the proposed sale of the four packets amounting to 1.92g did not materialise, no trafficking was done or proved and what had been proved by the prosecution so far was only possession by the accused of 46.56g of diamorphine and nothing more. Counsel urged the Court to accept the defence version that the accused retained a substantial quantity of the drug as a reserve for his daily consumption and the fact it was kept in a plastic bag and was being carried by the accused at the time of his arrest should not be construed as trafficking within the meaning of s 5(a) of the Act. Counsel further submitted that since no overt act had been proved, the prosecution had failed to prove a charge of trafficking against the accused person.
DPP's final speech and amendment to the charge
37 The learned DPP Miss Koh in her final speech submitted that possession of 46.56g of diamorphine had been proved by the prosecution by virtue of ss 17 and 18(2) of the Act. She contended that the burden has shifted to the accused that he was trafficking in diamorphine and it was for him to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the presumption under s 17. She however conceded that out of the total of 46.56g of diamorphine, 0.13g of diamorphine found in a single packet along with a straw and kept in his front pocket was for his consumption. Consequently the charge against the accused was amended to read that the accused trafficked in 117 packets containing not less than 46.43g of diamorphine. < Emphasis added. > The amended charge was read and an opportunity was given to the accused to recall any witnesses. There being no objection to the proposed amendment and no request for the recall of any witnesses, the Court went on to consider the submissions of the DPP on the amended charge.
Conclusion
38 Proof of the purpose for which an act is done had always presented a problem in criminal proceedings. In this context, it pays to quote Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor < 1981 > 1 MLJ 64 at page 69 where he said: `Generally, in the absence of an express admission by the accused, the purpose with which he did an act is a matter of inference from what he did. Thus, in the case of an accused caught in the act of conveying from one place to another controlled drugs in a quantity much larger than is likely to be needed for his own consumption the inference that he was transporting them for the purpose of trafficking in them would, in the absence of any plausible explanation by him, be irresistible - even if there were no statutory presumption < s > ... As a matter of common sense the larger the quantity of drugs involved the stronger the inference that they were not intended for the personal consumption of the person carrying them, and the more convincing the evidence needed to rebut it.'
39 In reviewing the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence, I had little doubt in my mind that the accused was indeed an addict and that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the lock-up. I also concluded that the evidence of NSPI Ang as regards certain admissions by the accused in the police vehicle could not be relied upon as they were recalled many days later and that the sequence of the questions and answers was probably not recorded in the order in which they were given. I also gave the benefit of the doubt to the accused that the sum of $6,200 found in his possession in the plastic bag on that day was a loan obtained by him from his friends to meet the funeral expenses of his deceased sister. However his explanation that he was in the habit of carrying the drugs with him all the time as he could not retain them in his rented room was disbelieved by me. In this context it should be noted that a total of 118 plastic packets of drugs were found in his possession and except for one sachet which was kept in his shirt pocket (shown as B4A in photograph P-6) for consumption, the remainder was wrapped or bundled in five groups as follows:
(a) 62 plastic packets wrapped in newspapers kept inside a Marlboro cigarette box (the newspapers which were used as wrappers were dated 23 February and 3 March 1991 shown as A1 in photograph P-2); (b) 8 plastic packets wrapped in a newspaper - Lian He Zao Bao dated 22 February 1991 (shown as B2 in photograph P-6); (c) 14 packets wrapped in a newspaper - Lian He Zao Bao dated 22 February 1991 (shown as B3 in photograph P-6); (d) 29 packets wrapped in a plastic polythene bag (shown as B4 in photograph P-6); and (e) 4 packets wrapped in a newspaper allegedly meant for sale to one Ang (shown as B4A in photograph P-6).
40 When asked by the Court why there were four separate bundles of 8, 14, 29 and 4 packets, (leaving aside the 62 packets) when, after all, he was going to sell to Ang that evening only the bundle containing four packets, the answers the accused gave were somewhat ambivalent. In my view the division of the drugs into four separate groups did not support his defence that the remainder was for his consumption. If the remainder was indeed for his personal use there was no necessity for them to be packed separately as had been done.
41 As to the nature of the drug found in the possession of the accused there was in fact no dispute. Apart from the prosecution's reliance on s 18(2) of the Act which provides that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of the drug, it was the evidence of the accused himself that he knew the nature of the drug he was carrying.
42 Now reverting to the presumption contained under s 17, the law as enacted makes it clear that so long as a person is proved to have in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, until the contrary is proved, he shall be presumed to traffic in that controlled drug. The accused's explanation that he was carrying the drugs for a limited purpose of selling only four packets and the remainder being for his consumption, was not accepted by me. In my view, the accused has not proved the contrary on a balance of probabilities. Granting that he is an addict, his course of conduct on the day in question in fact pointed to the opposite direction that he was at Changi Road to sell the drugs in his possession save for that one packet which was found in his shirt pocket. The fact that the accused did not bring about his intended object to fruition is irrelevant in the scheme of the Misuse of Drugs Act. He was therefore found guilty of the amended charge and convicted accordingly.",1993-03-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

JUDGMENT
The plaintiff was incorporated on 14 June 1972. The first defendant was one of the original directors. He was also the managing director at all material times. It is alleged by the plaintiff that while acting as managing director the first defendant was `the controlling mind' of the plaintiff.
A company, Collin Investment Pte Ltd (`CIP') now known as Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd was incorporated on 14 August 1972 with the second defendant's wife, one Ching Mun Fong and his daughter Collin Tan as directors. Although the second defendant only became a director of CIP in or about August 1973, it is alleged that the second defendant was at all material times in effective control of CIP. The third defendant was one of the original directors of the plaintiff.
The fourth defendant formerly known as Collin Development Pte Ltd was incorporated on 1 February 1973. The second defendant was a director and in effective control of the fourth defendant.
In or about June 1972 the plaintiff entered into an agreement with the estate of Tan Chwee Boon, deceased, for the purchase of eight parcels of land with a total area of about 186.7 acres comprised in lots 21-26, 4-7, 4-4, 221, 120, 121, 122 and 123 of Mukim 28 which is off Kampong Chai Chee. The price was $1,090,000. The purchase was completed on 27 October 1972.
On 20 July 1972, two of the lots being 221 and 4-4 with a total area of about 5.8 acres were acquired by the Government. The sum of $228,000 or $0.89 per square foot was paid to the plaintiff by way of compensation.
On 27 October 1972, the purchase by the plaintiff was completed.
On 23 January 1973 the plaintiff entered into an agreement with CIP for the sale to CIP of three of the lots namely 21-26 (156 acres 2 roods and 20 poles), 4-7 (19 acres 1 rood and 6 poles), 123 (2 acres 3 roods and 11 poles)(`the three lots') for $2,050,000. The first defendant signed the agreement on behalf of the plaintiff. The second defendant signed on behalf of CIP.
On the same day, by another agreement (`the sub-sale agreement') between CIP of the one part and one Lim Siam Soi and the said Collin Tan of the other part, CIP agreed to sell to Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan part of Lot 21-26 with an area of approximately 5 acres at the price of $50,000. Lim Siam Soi is the wife of the first defendant. The second defendant signed the sub-sale agreement on behalf of CIP and Collin Tan. The first defendant signed on behalf of his wife the said Lim Siam Soi.
As no subdivisional approval had been obtained for the excision of the five acres, on completion of the sale by the plaintiff to CIP, the three lots on the instructions of CIP were conveyed to the fourth defendant.
On 23 July 1976 the three lots except for the five acres the subject matter of the sub-sale agreement were acquired by the Government for public housing and infrastructure. The five acres following a title survey is now known as Lot 1606. On acquisition the sum of $2,500,000 was paid. This works out at $0.33 per square foot. The award was presumably based on the market value on 30 November 1973 pursuant to section 33 of the Land Acquisition Act.
Due to disputes arising out of the sub-sale agreement, Lim Siam Soi on 25 June 1984 commenced action in Suit 4149 of 1984 against the second and fourth defendants herein Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd and Collin Tan.
The plaintiff now under the control of Benny Fang Kum Kwong say that they became aware of the sub-sale agreement as a result of the proceedings in Suit 4149 of 1984. In that suit the sub-sale agreement was disclosed. It is alleged therein by Lim Siam Soi that the second defendant herein Tan Geok Tee either on his own or on behalf of the fourth defendant herein Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd agreed to purchase Lim Siam Soi's one-half share in Lot 1606 for $3,800,000.
The plaintiff thereupon commenced these proceedings on 25 May 1987. Paragraphs 6 and 8 of the plaintiff's Re-amended Statement of Claim read:
""6. By a conspiracy to defraud the Plaintiffs which conspiracy was hatched between the 1st and the 2nd Defendants and of which conspiracy the 3rd Defendant was at all material times aware, the 1st Defendant as the Managing Director or Director of and on behalf of the Plaintiffs conspired to sell and the 2nd Defendant on behalf of CIP conspired to purchase and to further this purpose entered into an agreement on or about 23rd January 1973 for the sale of the Lots 21-26, 4-7 and 123 comprising about 176 acres for an inordinately low price of $2,050,000-00 in spite of the large area involved. Subsequently the sale was registered in the name of the 4th Defendants.
8. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants knew or ought to have known by reason of the fact that the said Lot 1606 (of about 5 acres) would not be acquired by the government and therefore was worth or would be worth several million dollars and hence the Plaintiffs have been defrauded by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants, or any one or more of them.
Particulars of Fraud of the 1st, and 2nd and 3rd defendants or any one or more of them
(a) The 1st and 3rd defendants agreed to sell the said 21-26, 4-7 and 123 of Mukim XXVIII totalling approximately 176 acres for $2,050,000 only, and the 2nd defendant agreed to buy on behalf of CIP when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants well knew or ought to have known that the price was inordinately low by reason of the fact that they were equipped with the knowledge that the said 5 acres would not be acquired by the government.
(b) Having entered into the said agreement for sale and purchase referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above, all or some of the defendants were a party to CIP selling on the same day the said Lot 1606 to Lim Siam Soi (wife of the 1st defendant) and the said Collin Tan (daughter of the 2nd defendant) when all or some of the defendants had an interest in and/or were connected with CIP.
(c) Entered into the said agreement in paragraph 7 above at a price of only $50,000-00 when all or some of the defendants and the said Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan knew or ought to have known that the said Lot 1606 was likely to be unacquired by reason of the fact that the 1st and 2nd defendants signed the Agreements for and on behalf of their nominees and from the documents it would appear that the 1st and 2nd defendants wanted to retain the beneficial interest for themselves. Evidence will be adduced to show that the unacquired property was worth well over $1,000,000-00.
(d) Conspired with each other and their nominees namely the said Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan to sell through their said nominees one half share of the said Lot 1606 in or about the month of April 1981 to the 2nd defendant at a price of $3,800,000-00.
(e) ... ...
(f) ... ...""
On 19 October 1989 the learned senior assistant registrar ordered that the issue whether the sale was concluded at an inordinately low price be tried before the trial of the other questions or issues arising from this action.
This preliminary issue, the determination of which does not dispose of the whole action in the light of the present pleadings, came up for hearing before me.
The three lots were within four zones under the Master Plan Zoning, about 50.13% under Water Catchment, 20.02% under Rural, 7.84% under Permanent Residential and 22.01% under Temporary Residential. The three lots together with the rest of the land purchased from the estate of Tan Chwee Boon, deceased, were said in 1964 to have about 330 rent-controlled tenants paying a monthly rent of $410.90. There were also some other occupiers who did not pay any rent. Many of them grew vegetables on the land, reared pigs and poultry and some ran home handicraft.
According to PW1 Soh Kok Foo, a valuer testifying for the plaintiff, the market value of the three lots as at January 1973 should be $4,755,000. According to DW1 Y. S. Boey, a valuer who testified for the first defendant, the market value of the three lots as at 23 January 1973 was $2,050,000. In fact at page 34 of the Notes of Evidence he said:
""A: ... ... If you looked at the purchase in October the contract date would be July 1972, then the price of $2,050,000 paid by 4th defendant looks too high.""
DW2 Low Ser Seah, a valuer who testified for the second defendant, said that the market value of the three lots as at December 1972/January 1973 was $1,950,000.
All the three valuers used sales of comparable properties in support of their valuation. I find none of the comparables really comparable with the three lots in terms of size, zoning, degree of encumbrance, location and development potential. Although the evidence suggests that property prices had been moving up from 1972, the restrictions against foreigners buying residential property that came into effect on 10 September 1973 would have caused a dip if not checked the rise. Against this background the three lots less an area of about 5 acres were acquired in 1976 based on the market value as at 30 November 1973 for $2,500,000. Bearing in mind that neighbouring lands had been acquired and hence strong likelihood of this land being acquired too, the sale price of $2,050,000 in January 1973 though low was not inordinately low between a willing buyer and willing seller if both had no knowledge that part of Lot 21-26 measuring 4.2 acres would not be acquired.
However for someone who is alleged to have known that these 4.2 acres part of 21-26 and now being Lot 1606 would not be acquired and more so that after acquisition of the rest of the land, Lot 1606 would have access to an expressway and other public roads, then the price of $2,050,000 for the three lots was inordinately low. This is borne out according to the plaintiff by the claim by the first defendant's wife in Suit 4149/84 for $3,800,000 for her one half share in Lot 1606. In fact in the affidavit of Tan Eng Khuay filed on behalf of the fourth defendant on 13 November 1989 para 14 he deposed that the fourth defendant in July 1988 received an offer from one `Lay Kok Weng to buy Lot 1606 Mukim 28 for S$14,250,000-00.'",1993-05-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

The plaintiffs are a firm of hauliers. The defendants are in the business of importing and distributing bank vault doors. In April 1990, one of the defendants' customers, DBS Bank, was moving to new premises. The bank wanted the doors at their old premises to be dismantled for use later at their new premises. As the new premises were not ready, the doors had to be kept in storage somewhere. The defendants, through their marketing manager Mr Jason Tan, got in touch with Mr Koh, the general manager of the plaintiffs. Their discussions led to a written quotation from the plaintiffs dated 21 April 1990. This document is of some importance, and I set it out verbatim:
We are pleased to submit our quotation for your perusal as flw :-
Supplying Labours, Lorries, Mobile Crane and working tools to transport 7 Nos. of vaults doors from DBS Shenton Way basement to Bukit Batok DBS and our Warehouse.
We are quoting as flwg:-
A) One No. vault door (wt 500-600 kgs) & One "" (wt 800 kgs) to be transport from DBS Shenton Way Basement to DBS Bukit Batok.
B) Five nos. vault doors (wt 500-600 kgs) to be transported from DBS Shenton Way Basement to Our Warehouse for storage.
SUM QUOTED PER NO. S$500.00 ---$2500.00
These five nos. doors are to be stuffed into pallets for storage in our Warehouse.
SUM QUOTED PER PALLET AT S$350.00 ----$1750.00
Insurance Coverage for each of machinery is insured at the maximum amount (of not exceeding) S$150,000.00 ONLY.
As stated in this quotation, two of the doors were to go to the bank's premises at Bukit Batok and five of them were to go to ""our warehouse"" for storage. Further discussions followed. The two doors which were originally going to DBS Bukit Batok were to go into storage as well as the five doors. The discussions led to the issue by the defendants of a purchase order dated 16 May 1990. The material part of that is set out below:
A) 5 Nos vault doors (600 kg)
To be transported from DBS Shenton Way basement to your warehouse for storage .............. $2,000
B) 1 No vault door (wt 1.5 Ton) 1 No vault door (wt 800 kg)
To be transported from DBS warehouse in Jurong to your warehouse for storage ............ $ 600/-
C) 7 Nos of vault doors are to be shifted into pallet and wrapped with plastic for storage in your warehouse ........$2,100/- $4,700/-
REMARKS
You are responsible for the safekeeping of the doors and any damages caused arising from dismantling, transporting, handling and storage.
N.B. : Please quote our P.O. No. in your delivery note and invoice.
The words under the ""Remarks"" heading are a bone of contention in these proceedings.
On 17 May 1990, the doors were dismantled by the defendants, loaded on to the plaintiffs' lorries and taken to a warehouse belonging to Everise Warehousing & Transportation Pte Ltd. They were taken into storage.
An invoice dated 17 May 1990 was issued by the plaintiffs. It referred to the defendants' purchase order number, and to the transport of the doors to ""our warehouse"" for storage and to storage in ""our warehouse.""
The warehouse shared premises with other warehouses in a common building. As luck would have it, a few days later, at about 10 o'clock on the evening of 25 May, a fire broke out in one of the neighbouring warehouses. It engulfed the entire building. The doors stored in the Everise warehouse were all damaged beyond repair.
In this action, the plaintiffs claim the sum of $7,500, being the total sum of four invoices. This includes an invoice for $4,700 for the work in relation to the seven doors. The defendants deny liability for this invoice, and in turn make a counterclaim for the loss of the doors damaged in the fire. The parties have agreed the sum of $50,000 as the value of the doors. The action had been started in November 1991 in the subordinate courts, but was subsequently transferred to this court as the amount of the counterclaim at the time ($87,000) exceeded the then jurisdiction of the subordinate courts.
The central issue of the case concerns the scope of the contract and the scope of the plaintiffs' obligations under it. The plaintiffs contend that they were responsible only for the safe transport of the doors to the warehouse. The defendants, on the other hand, contend that the plaintiffs were not only responsible for transporting the doors to the warehouse, but also responsible for their safe storage and that any damage to or loss of the doors is chargeable to the plaintiffs.
Mr Koh's evidence is that his firm's business was that of hauliers. It did not have a warehouse; neither did it store or undertake to store goods for customers. He knew of Everise's warehouse, having stored his own equipment there. When the defendants asked him to arrange for storage, he agreed to arrange to transport them to the Everise warehouse. He said that he told Jason Tan that the charges would probably be about $8 a cubic metre, and that the warehouse owners would bill the defendants direct. He could not have agreed to be responsible for storage because, in the first place, he did not have a warehouse of his own, and, secondly, storage was not part of his business. He pointed out that he never charged the defendants for the storage, and that it was Everise who in fact undertook the storage. He referred to a warehouseman's receipt issued by Everise to the defendants dated 18 May 1990. It so happened that, as confirmed by the receipt chop of the defendants, this document, together with a bill for a door previously put into storage, was received by the defendants at 12 noon on 25 May, the day of the fire but before the fire. So the authencity of these documents cannot be in doubt. The plaintiffs say that these documents support their contention that the storage contract was always intended to be between Everise and the defendants and not between the plaintiffs and defendants.
Mr Koh is illiterate in the English language. He appears to have relied on a clerk, Miss Lim, to deal with correspondence and documents in English. Mr Koh's evidence is that the purchase order had not been brought to his attention at that time. He said that he had done jobs for the defendants for a long time and the purchase orders had usually been received after the job was completed. In this particular case, he did not know when in fact it was received. He assumed it must have been received after the job was done. In any event, it was received by the clerk and he was not told about it. Miss Lim left the firm four years ago. She was not called to give evidence. I was not told of the reason. However, no point has been made of this.
Mr Jason Tan's evidence for the defendants, all given in cross- examination, may be summarised as follows. He said that when he spoke to Mr Koh about this job, he told Mr Koh that he wanted him to store the doors as well as to transport them. He said that he told Koh that the storage would be for an indefinite period, and that Koh was to be responsible for any damage in storage. It was his expectation that Koh would be responsible.
It should be noted that the issue as to the scope of the contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants had been fairly clearly raised in the pleadings. The plaintiffs had clearly denied responsibility for loss or damage in storage. However, in his affidavit evidence in chief, Jason Tan said nothing at all about the contents of the discussions between him and Koh, except the following:
""I spoke to < Koh > and asked him to quote me a storage charge. I am unable to recall what he quoted me, but I cited $80 per cubic metre to our clients.""
He then went on to say in the affidavit that the contract between the parties are contained in the plaintiffs' quotation and the defendants' purchase order. In his examination in chief in court, too, he said nothing about the discussions between him and Koh. It was only in cross-examination that he gave the evidence as summarised above.
It is noteworthy that nowhere in his evidence, either in the affidavit or in court, did Jason Tan say what was Koh's response to his request, proposal or expectation, call it what you will, that Koh should be responsible for storage and for damage in storage.
So far as the purchase order is concerned, Mr Tan said that it was drawn up after the discussion about the storage. He said that the purchase order was faxed over to the plaintiffs. However, he did not say when that was done. He had heard Mr Koh's evidence that the document was probably or might have been sent to him after the job was completed, but offered no evidence to counter that.
What I have said is by no means a criticism of Mr Tan. My impression is that Mr Tan was, indeed, a truthful witness, and was not prepared to say anything which he did not believe to be true.
After the fire, the defendants made a claim for the damaged doors, not from the plaintiffs, but from Everise's insurers. The insurers denied liability and confirmed their position by a letter dated 12 September 1990. On 19 October 1990, the plaintiffs requested payment of their invoices, and threatened legal action. On 6 November 1990, the defendants' solicitors replied, and, apparently for the first time, asserted that the plaintiffs were responsible for damage in storage. They referred to the purchase order.
On the evidence, my findings are as follows. There is no doubt that the discussions between Tan and Koh were about transporting as well as storing the doors. However, the evidence falls short of showing that a definite agreement had been reached that the plaintiffs were to be responsible for the storage of the doors or for loss and damage in storage. The evidence of the defendants leaves a serious doubt in my mind whether the purchase order can safely be taken as conclusive evidence of the contract entered into between the parties in relation to these matters. The evidence of the purchase order, and the documents emanating from the plaintiffs and referring to ""our warehouse"", should be weighed with other evidence and circumstances of the case for the purpose of deciding whether any such agreement had been reached.
It is not disputed that the price stated in the purchase order and in the invoice was only for transport and not for storage as well. It is also evident that after carrying out the contract for the transport of the doors, the plaintiffs left it to the warehouse owners to deal with the defendants in relation to the storage of the goods. This is supported by the fact that the warehouseman's receipt was issued in favour of the defendants by Everise. This document had been prepared days before the fire and was received by the defendants on the day of the fire, but before its occurrence. That adds value to the document as evidence.
The conduct of the defendants after the fire also supports the conclusion that they never seriously expected the plaintiffs to bear the loss. As stated earlier, they looked to Everise's insurers, rather than to the plaintiffs, for compensation. The contention that the plaintiffs were responsible appears to have surfaced only after the plaintiffs made the claim for their invoices.
Defendants' counsel submitted that the subsequent conduct of a party to a contract should not be used to construe the meaning of a contractual term. However, the issue here is not the meaning of a term of contract, but whether the contract in fact contained a particular term. I see no reason why the conduct of the parties, either before or after the conclusion of the alleged contract, cannot be referred to for this purpose.
Taking all this evidence and these circumstances into account, it seems to me that the defendants really have not, on balance, discharged the burden, which is clearly on them, of proving that the parties had reached an agreement in the terms alleged by them and as reflected in the remarks in the purchase order. In saying this, I am conscious of the fact that there are gaps in the plaintiffs' evidence as well. In particular, there has been no explanation why Miss Lim has not been called. All that has been said is that she left the firm four years ago. However, as stated above, the defendants have not made a point of it.
In the circumstances, it appears to me that the defendants have not established their counterclaim. It must therefore be dismissed. The plaintiffs' claim based on the invoices is not disputed. Judgment must therefore be entered for the plaintiffs in the sum of $7,500 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum on that sum from the date of writ to the date of judgment. The plaintiffs shall have one set of costs for both the claim and counterclaims, on the High Court scale in respect of the proceedings in the High Court and on the Subordinate Courts scale in respect of the proceedings in the subordinate courts.
Dated this 31st day of July, 1995.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
The accused, Ong Yeow Tian, was tried before me on two charges.
First Charge ""You, ONG YEOW TIAN, are charged that on or about the 15th day of February 1989 at about 2.20 am along Tampines Street 22, Singapore, did use an arm, to wit, by firing one shot at Police Corporal 2418 Goh Soon Wan with a Smith & Wesson revolver No. SPF 5494 with intent to cause physical injury to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 4 of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.""
Second Charge ""You, ONG YEOW TIAN, on or about the 15th day of February 1989 at about 3.20 am behind Block 281, Tampines Street 22, Singapore, did use an arm, to wit, by firing one shot at Corporal 1826146-D Ang Chye Hai of the Special Constabulary with a Smith & Wesson revolver No. SPF 5494 with intent to cause physical injury to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 4 of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.""
The Prosecution Case
At about 2.16am on 15 February 1989 two police officers, Sergeant Omar Bin Mohd Amin (Sgt Omar) and Corporal Goh Soon Wan (Cpl Goh) were manning the Changkat Neighbourhood Police Post (the Police Post) when Lachumana s/o Govindasamy, the driver of taxi No SHA 2765 M, reported that whilst overtaking another taxi No SH 2375, he saw the passenger of that taxi holding a knife in his hand. He feared the driver of SH 2375 would be robbed. Lachumana was, however, unable to give evidence as he had passed away between the date of the preliminary inquiry and the date of trial.
The two police officers got into Lachumana's taxi and the trio set off to find taxi SH 2375. They spotted SH 2375 at the junction of Tampines Avenue 2 and Tampines Street 22. The traffic light at the junction was in their favour, and Lachumana turned his taxi into Tampines Street 22 and came to a stop near SH 2375. The two officers alighted and signalled taxi SH 2375 to stop. Lachumana saw the two of them approach the taxi from the left. He saw the passenger bend down, hold up a revolver and open fire. He immediately drove back to the Police Post.
Cpl Goh testified that he and Sgt Omar approached taxi SH 2375 from the left. Sgt Omar walked round to cover the rear door on the right while Cpl Goh himself covered the rear door on the left, the side on which the passenger was sitting. He drew his revolver as a precautionary measure, pointing it towards the ground, as he had been warned that the passenger was armed with a knife. He saw the window on the accused's side being wound down, and at the same time he heard the accused say ""Don't force me, don't force me"". A moment later, he saw the accused put a hand in his left trouser pocket. At this juncture he was within two feet of the passenger door of the taxi. Suddenly he saw the barrel of a revolver above the window ledge pointing outwards in his direction and then a shot was fired. Cpl Goh fired a shot in return into the taxi, ducked down beside the taxi and ran towards the carpark. From the safety of the carpark he saw the accused run out of the taxi with a hand over his stomach and lost sight of him in Block 285.
Sgt Omar who, at the time of the shooting, was on the offside of the taxi to Cpl Goh, was not able to give significant evidence. He testified that whilst he was running from the rear of the taxi to the passenger door on the other side of the taxi, he heard two shots. Realising that the accused had a revolver, he ran from the taxi into the carpark.
The driver of the taxi SH 2375, Mohamed Bin Syed (Mohamed), gave evidence that on 15 February he had stopped for the accused at approximately 2.10am along Simei Street 3. He asked the accused where he wished to go. Instead the accused asked him if he had seen any roadblocks. After receiving a reply in the negative the accused asked to be brought to Tampines Street 22. En route, the accused instructed him to look for Block 272 or 274. Whilst on Tampines Street 22, he saw two uniformed policemen signalling him to stop. He complied. Thinking that the policemen wished to speak to his passenger, he activated the mechanism that wound down the left rear window which was next to the accused as the police approached him. He then turned to look backwards. He saw the accused attempting to locate the door lever. Mohamed was about to aid him when he saw a revolver in accused's left hand. This shocked him and he pulled back his hand. He then heard the accused say: ""Don't force me, don't force me"". Two gunshots were fired almost simultaneously with the first shot coming from within the taxi. Mohamed told the accused in English not to shoot in his taxi. The accused told him not to worry. A few seconds later the accused opened the door and ran out from the taxi. He immediately drove off to the Police Post to report the incident.
At about 2.50am, the Police Task Force led by Inspector Sng arrived at Simei Avenue in one command vehicle, one landrover and a bus. They were met by Cpl Goh who directed them to Block 281 Tampines Street 22. Five men formed a search and assault party whilst the others performed cordon duty. The members of the search and assault party wore bullet-proof vests. After the team had advanced in single file for 20 to 30 metres movement was sighted in the high bushes, which ran along the rim of the Pan-Island Expressway. The team made an about turn as the movement was behind them. Corporal Ang Chye Hai (Cpl Ang) was now in the foremost position. He was walking in the waist-high drain adjacent to the bushes.
Inspector Sng gave evidence that he heard a shot ring out from the bushes, and he saw Cpl Ang fall backwards. Cpl Ang elaborated on how he had been shot. He stated that as he was moving forward with a torchlight in his left hand he suddenly saw less than five metres away a pair of legs and a hand holding a revolver pointing at him. Before he could react, a shot was fired at him hitting him on the chest over the sternum. He fired a shot as he keeled backwards and fell into the drain. Fortunately for him, because of the bullet-proof vest he wore, the bullet that struck him was not fatal. He did however lose consciousness for several moments.
The assault party fired at the bushes. Sgt Omar Bin Abdullah, a member of the assault team, shouted in English to the accused to surrender. The reply he heard was ""Balls to you, I still have rounds left"". This reply was confirmed by Inspector Sng and another member of the assault team Ong Hock Seng. More shots were then fired by the team at the bushes.
Shortly after that the accused emerged from the bushes with the revolver in his right hand and fell into the drain. Inspector Sng ordered him to drop the revolver. He complied. Cpl Ang took the revolver and handed it back to Inspector Sng. The accused was arrested and taken to hospital.
Subsequently ASP Samadi Bin Aman (ASP Samadi) took over the investigations. He examined the revolver the accused had used, it was a .38 Smith & Wesson numbered SPF 5494. There were four .38 fired cartridges and one .38 bullet in the chambers. The .38 bullet was at the 2 o'clock position.
On 6 June ASP Samadi organised an identification parade at the air-well of the CID lock-up. The accused was identified by Cpl Goh. On 10 June he organised another parade. This time the accused was identified by the taxi driver, Mohamed Bin Said.
ASP Samadi also took statements from the accused on both the charges. Defence counsel disputed the admissibility of these statements. This necessitated a voire-dire.
The voire-dire
On 27 February ASP Samadi went to Changi Prison together with an interpreter Loh Kok Lin to interview the accused. Upon arrival they spoke to Dr Naranjan Singh, the Senior Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital. The latter was asked about the treatment the accused had been given and whether the accused was on any sedative medication. He was told that the accused was not on any sedatives and could communicate normally. A statement not used in the case was taken. On that day the accused was in a wheelchair.
The next day, on 28 February, ASP Samadi and Loh went again to Changi Prison at about 11.20am. They were allocated an interview room. The accused was escorted to the room by the prison warder. He was able to walk slowly.
ASP Samadi stated that the accused looked normal and did not appear to be in pain. He did not complain of any pain. He asked the accused if the part of his stomach that had a bag attached to it owing to an earlier colostomy hurt. The accused replied in the negative. It was ascertained that the accused wished to give his statement in Hokkien. The first charge was read to the accused and interpreted to him. He acknowledged that he understood it and then signed beneath the charge. The same charge was written on a separate sheet and the accused again acknowledged it. The notice of warning in compliance with s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code was written, read and explained to the accused afterwhich the accused signed beneath it. A copy of the charge and warning were served on the accused and he acknowledged receipt. The accused then volunteered a statement. After the statement had been read back to him in Hokkien he signed it. ASP Samadi and Loh then signed under it.
ASP Samadi testified that the second statement was taken five minutes after the completion of the first one, at approximately 11.50am. The same procedure was followed. The accused also initialled against an amendment to the word ""revolver"" in the charge.
On cross-examination it was suggested by defence counsel that the accused could not walk on the 28 February; his voice was hoarse having been under anaesthetic; and he was in great pain owing to a spinal injury and back operation. ASP Samadi would not agree. He was firm that the accused was mentally fit.
Dr Naranjan Singh testified that the accused had had a laparotomy, an exploration of the abdomen, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In addition he had been treated for gunshot wounds in his chest, abdomen and left arm. On 25 February when the accused was transferred to Changi Prison Hospital his condition was stable: he had several wounds that required dressing and a colostomy, an artificial passage in the abdomen for the discharge of natural wastes. He was not on any medication. Panadol was given whenever he requested for it. He could walk about the ward and he was not at anytime bedridden. On 28 February the accused had complained of chest pain and cough. He was given Panadol and a cough mixture that contained no sedative. In cross-examination, Dr Naranjan Singh said that the injuries sustained by the accused during the shoot-out were quite serious. He agreed with defence counsel that the accused would not be ""comfortable"" and that he would suffer pain on deep breathing owing to four fractures, but his shallow breathing would be unaffected. However Dr Singh stated he had no trouble communicating with him and thought him to be ""mentally quite clear"".
The accused gave evidence of the injuries he had sustained on 15 February. He said that on 25 February he was still in pain. His left arm hurt whenever he moved; he could not straighten his back owing to a surgical wound; and he experienced pain whenever his right intestines contracted inwards. On 28 February he could not walk with ease. He stated that owing to the pain he suffered, he could not concentrate on the questions put to him by the officers. He had been told that he had to speak there and then. He was also fearful of what might happen to him if he failed to co-operate.
In cross-examination the accused agreed with the DPP that he had given his statements voluntarily and that he had no problem understanding the interpreter. He stated he was afraid because he was surrounded by police officers that morning but he agreed that no one threatened him. He testified that the pain he experienced was not mild, but that he could endure it.
Defence counsel submitted that the notice of warning in s 122(6) amounted to a peremptory order. He contended that although this was not objectionable in the case of an ordinary healthy person the accused in contrast had sustained serious injuries and was not in possession of his full mental capacity, hence there was doubt as to the voluntariness of the statements.
I found no merit in the submissions for the accused. Admittedly the accused was in some pain when he gave his statements but I was more than satisfied that his ability to think clearly was not in any way affected. It is also to be noted that the accused himself said that the statements he gave were voluntary statements. I admitted them in evidence.
The Accused's Statements
The following is his statement in respect of the first charge:
"" I have said that in my statement yesterday that as the taxi which I was in turned into a road, two policemen who were already there stopped the taxi. One of the policemen knocked the window with a baton while the other one fired a shot at me. I was hit on my right chest. So I returned fire at him with the gun I had taken from the other policeman earlier on.""
In respect of the second charge he made the following statement:
"" When I was hiding in the bush, I was surrounded by the Police. A policeman shone a torch at me so I fired a shot at him. I was unable to see him. I fired at the direction of the torchlight.""
At the close of the prosecution case the defence did not make a submission of no case to answer. Upon a review of the evidence, on the facts I have stated, I was satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused, which if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. I called upon him to enter his defence.
The defence
The accused was a hairdresser before his arrest. He volunteered that he had two previous convictions for drug consumption and another for housebreaking and theft.
In respect of the first charge the accused's defence was that he had not intended to fire at Cpl Goh. He had come into possession of the Smith & Wesson during a struggle with a police officer after a housebreaking incident earlier that evening. Prior to this incident, he had not handled a revolver. After wresting the revolver from the police officer, in the course of which the officer was shot and seriously wounded and later died, the accused ran to the highway and hailed a taxi, telling the driver to take him to Block 272 or 274 near Tampines Street 22. When the taxi was stopped by the two police officers he had wanted to run away. However, as he was about to open the door, the two of them were already in his words ""very close to me"". He, therefore, took out the revolver and said ""Don't force me"" twice. He said that he fired a shot into the air merely to frighten Cpl Goh. At the same time he opened the door of the taxi to make his getaway when he was shot in the right side of his chest. He ran to a block of flats. He realised that the blood from his bleeding wound would cause him to be easily detected in the block of flats, so he ran to some bushes and hid there. In the course of his flight he threw away the knife he had with him in his trouser pocket as it was impeding his movements. At first he lay in a prone position with his face down in the grass. Later when he could not hear any sound he got up and crouched in the bushes.
The accused said that he had no intention to shoot Cpl Ang. He only wanted to run away, if he could get the chance. When he saw the light shining in his direction he fired a shot merely to frighten them so he could flee. He fired at the ground, his intention was not to hit anyone. Thereafter he was shot. He admitted saying: ""Balls to you I still have rounds with me"" when asked to surrender. He stated that he said those words only to anger the police into killing him as he did not intend to live. He stood up hoping the police would fire more bullets at him. Instead he slipped on the slope and fell into the drain.
In cross-examination the accused said that he was right-handed. He admitted asking the taxi driver whether there was a road-block ahead when he entered the taxi. He did not surrender to the police officers when they came up to the taxi because he realised he would face heavy penalties if he were arrested for the incident earlier in the evening from where he had obtained the police revolver. In re-examination he elaborated that he thought he would face the death penalty as the earlier incident involved a police officer and he had used a fire- arm.
He said that he could not open the door of the taxi without using the revolver to make his escape because Cpl Goh was too close; he was ""immediately outside the door"". He agreed with the DPP that when he stated ""Don't force me"" the intent of his words was ""Don't force me to shoot you"". He denied that the revolver was pointed in the direction of Cpl Goh when he pulled the trigger. After fleeing from the taxi it did not occur to him to throw the revolver away. He disagreed that he kept it for use against the police. He also retracted the statement he had made on 28 February that indicated that the police officer had fired at him first.
He admitted that whilst he was hiding in the bushes he did not think of surrendering to the police. He was still hoping that the police would not find him in the bushes. The light shone at him from the left at an angle. He was adamant that he fired at the ground. He retracted the part of his statement that stated that he had ""fired at"" Cpl Ang. However he admitted that he fired in the direction of the torchlight. In re-examination he stated that it did not occur to him that he would hit anyone if he fired in the direction of the light but at the ground. He stated however that he knew there would be someone in the drain otherwise the light would not come from there.
Findings of the Court
After hearing the submissions of defence counsel and the DPP, I found that the facts of this case were substantially not in dispute. The defences to both charges were the absence of mens rea.
On a review of the evidence, I rejected the explanations of the accused on both charges. I found that he had intentionally shot at Cpl Goh when Cpl Goh came to the door of the taxi to question him. Because he had killed another police officer earlier that evening, he clearly intended to evade arrest. Moreover, by the use of the words: ""Don't force me"" he was determined to shoot Cpl Goh to make his getaway. I found no merit in the argument for the defence that if he had aimed at Cpl Goh he would definitely have hit him. It is to be noted that the accused was right-handed whereas when he was in the taxi the revolver was in his left hand; it was also with that hand that he had taken it out from his left trouser pocket; at the same time, he was attempting to open the door; and, as the events happened so quickly he would have had no time to take aim or to fire with any precision, especially when he had no experience of using a revolver.
As for the second charge, I disbelieved the accused that he merely wanted to frighten the police by firing at the ground. The strong evidence against him is that he had shot Cpl Ang squarely on the chest. After that his belligerent reply: ""Balls to you I still have rounds left"" surely was of a man quite ready to shoot it out with the police to the bitter end.
I was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty on both charges. I convicted him on them and the mandatory death sentence was passed.",1994-02-28 00:00:00,SG High Court

J U D G M E N T
1 By this originating summons, the plaintiff an estranged wife, seeks a declaration that an instrument of transfer executed by her along with a deed of separation, on or about 11 November 1993 (sic), conveying her right, title and interest in a jointly owned matrimonial home known as 46 Thomson Terrace, Singapore ('the property') to her husband, for a nominal consideration of one Singapore dollar, is void upon the ground that it was obtained by him under duress and or undue influence.
She alleged that she would not have transferred the property to her husband if not for his threat that he would kill their two young children and commit suicide, if she refused to execute the said transfer.
2 The husband denied the wife's allegations. He averred that she was carrying on an illicit affair with one Henry Ho Kum Hong ('Henry Ho') and was determined to walk out of their marriage. His several pleas and entreaties to bring to her senses were unsuccessful and being insistent on freeing herself from the marriage bond, she voluntarily and without any pressure on his part executed the transfer.
3 Testimonies of the parties as to the circumstances leading to the execution of the transfer were at considerable variance. It is therefore necessary to deal with the claims and evidence in this matter at some length.
4 Parties were married in June 1988. Wife is a tour guide and the husband a businessman. They have two young children through their union, a boy and a girl, five and four years of age respectively. The husband is 11 years older than the wife and this age difference had apparently something to do with their perceived incompatability -more so from the point of view of the wife.
5 Shortly after the marriage, they bought a property, a terrace house for $436,000. The property is currently valued by Richard Ellis at S$1,350,000 and its value at the time when the transfer was executed ie, on or about 11 November 1993 was S$950,000. The valuation of the property as of 12 November 1993 as accepted by the Commissioner of Stamps was $800,000.
Financial contributions
6 There was much dispute as to the monetary contributions made by each party towards the purchase price of the property. The wife claimed that she was the major contributor and that she had paid out a total of $240,206 by way of initial deposits and monthly loan repayments, in addition to disbursing a sum of $26,000 for the purchase of furniture and fittings and a further sum of $90,200 for the husband's business. The tabulation of her contributions as appears at paras 4 and 5 of her affidavit of 21 October 1994 is as follows:
Initial deposit $43,600
Monthly instalments of approximately $3,500 towards the housing loan obtained from Hong Leong Finance Ltd from about June 1988 to June 1991 (sic) 36 months
$126,000
Monthly instalments of $2,500 for another 13 months from July 1991 to July 1992
$32,500
Further contributions from 29 August 1992 to 4 December 1993
$38,106
Furniture and fittings $26,000
Contributions to husband's business from December 1988 to February 1993 $90,200
Total: $356,406
7 In this connection she claimed that in or around 1985 her income as a tourist guide was substantial and that her average monthly receipt was in the region of $20,000. However her income tax returns for the period 1988 to 1996 showed that her annual income for the abovestated period was only between $10,000 and S$15,000 (see pages 57 and 78 of NE).
8 The husband disputed the wife's figures substantially. His position was that apart from a sum of $11,700 which came from the wife's CPF and another sum of about $38,106 voluntarily paid by the wife, all other contributions towards the property came from him. His tabulation of the parties' respective contributions as gathered from his counsel's written submission (see pages 40 to 51, particularly pages 40, 44, 45 and 51) is as follows:

9 Leaving aside the dispute relating to the parties' actual monetary contributions towards the purchase of the house, their accounts as respects events leading to the deed of separation and the said transfer, are as follows.
Wife's version
10 The wife claimed that from 1993, their relationship had steadily deteriorated to the point they began discussing the prospect of separation between themselves and the husband taking the position that she left the matrimonial home leaving the children in his custody after transferring all her interests in the jointly held property to him.
11 As she was unwilling to accede to his demands, the husband became aggressive and started to utter threats to kill both their children and commit suicide. Even on the morning of 11 November 1993, when the wife was reluctant to proceed to the husband's solicitors' office to sign the documents, he in a fit of temper, tore birthday cards and letters, splashed water on the bed, spat on the floor and uttered threats to smash the television set, burn the flat and cut up the sofa set. As this was not the first time the husband had manifested such threats, she, in a state of fright and being mindful for the safety of her children, relented and proceeded to the office of the husband's solicitors where she executed the deed of separation and the transfer instrument. She stated that at her husband's solicitor's office all the formalities were carried out by the husband's solicitor Mr James Wan ('Mr Wan') in a most perfunctory manner and that he merely handed her the documents and asked her to sign them without explaining to her the import and significance of the deed of transfer.
12 She denied that she was carrying on any extra-marital relationship with Henry Ho or anyone else. She claimed that Henry Ho whom she had first met in December 1992 had been a good friend offering occasional assistance to her at the most once a week, as an English interpreter to explain the nature and quality of some health products she was marketing part-time, to her English- speaking customers (see page 17 of NE).
13 She alleged that her husband is a person of violent disposition. He has scars on his chest which she understood were stab wounds suffered by him before their marriage, when he fought with some people with knives. The husband had also warned her that he would break Henry Ho's legs if she continued her association with him. She took his threats seriously since her husband is a judo expert holding a black belt. She claimed that she was in great fear and was afraid of 'very severe consequences' if she went against his orders and hence her signing the documents proffered to her by the husband's solicitors.
14 She admitted however that from the beginning of November 1993 at least ten days before she had visited her husband's solicitors to execute the deed under reference, she had engaged the services of a firm of solicitors known as Ng Ong & Chee and received advice from them. She said that she in fact wanted them to handle the execution of the deed of separation and had briefed them about her husband's threats. She revealed that her solicitors' advice was that she should not sign the deed.
However after she had signed the same, she went back to her solicitor to relate the events, and was upbraided by him for not heeding his advice. All the same, her solicitor wanted to sort out the custody matter first and intended to deal with the issue relating to the property, three years later. She explained that she signed the deed against the advice of her solicitor because she had been subjected to much mental torture by her husband's begging and 'kowtowing' to her not to leave him and above all his threats to kill the children and committing suicide (pages 23,24 and 27 of NE).
Husband's account
15 The husband's account can be summarised as follows.
16 Sometime in October 1992, he discovered that his wife was having an affair with Henry Ho, a part-time insurance agent. At that time the eldest child of the marriage was only about 18 months old and the youngest eight months. As he loved his children very much, he was determined to save the marriage and was prepared to let the past rest. Towards this end, he tried his best to persuade his wife to change her ways. But she was adamant and confessed to him that she was madly in love with Henry Ho and asked her husband to free her from the wedlock. She said that she did not desire anything and all she wanted was her freedom. She repeatedly told him that he could have the children, the house and the rest and thereafter to allow her to be free from the marriage (para 14 of the husband's first affidavit of 23 December 1994).
17 The husband did his best to dissuade her but to no avail. She was not interested in the marriage nor the family and even once threatened that if he did not grant her the freedom she wanted, she would kill the children and destroy him thereafter.
18 The husband still did not give up, hoping that counselling might help his wife to change her ways. He therefore sought the assistance of a marriage counsellor, Mr James Tan, at the counselling and care unit at Sophia Road, Singapore. He also managed to persuade his wife to meet the counsellor on 8 November 1993 but it was an exercise in futility. The wife told him immediately after their visit to the counsellor that it was hopeless and their marriage could not be salvaged. She kept pressing him to seek the services of a lawyer to prepare documents for their separation and advised him that he could find one by going through the yellow pages. She again reminded him that he could have the children and the house if he would let her go. The only payment she demanded from him was for a sum of $47,000 (see paras 17, 18 and 19 of the husband's first affidavit).
19 Eventually following the suggestions by his wife, he scanned through the yellow pages and after a few telephone calls settled for James Wan & Co as Mr Wan was available to see him to prepare the documents on a basis of urgency. He first called on Mr Wan on 9 November 1993 and instructed him to finalise the documentation as concerns separation and the transfer of the property. Consequently, by prior appointment, parties attended at the office of Mr Wan where after explanation and the wife acknowledging that she understood everything, signed the documents (see paras 21 and 22 of the husband's first affidavit).
The documents having been signed and each party having been supplied with a copy each of the deed of separation, left Mr Wan's office. No copy of the transfer instrument was provided to them as they were advised by Mr Wan that a few other formalities were required to be done on the document.
20 The deed of separation executed contained, inter alia a non-molestation clause, a clause providing that the custody, care and control of the children be given to the husband with reasonable access to the wife and another clause in relation to the husband assigning to the wife personal chattels and effects then in her possession and control. There was no reference to the property in that deed.
21 The husband learnt from his solicitors on or about 15 November 1993 that his wife was demanding the payment of the sum of $47,000. The husband had promptly paid this sum to her on or about 20 December 1993 (see pages 34D-F and 35A-D of NE).
22 The matter did not come to an end. Disputes soon erupted between the parties over the terms of access to the two children and there followed a series of letters between the respective solicitors and police complaints by the husband against the wife. Interestingly however, no mention had been made by the wife's solicitors in any of those letters on the issue relating to the property.
23 It was not until 7 March 1994 - about four months after the execution of the transfer instrument - the husband's solicitors were for the very first time told by the wife's solicitors of the allegation that the wife was made to sign the transfer under duress. The relevant segments of Ng Ong & Chee's letter dated 7 March 1994 read as follows:
We are further instructed that before our client signed the Deed of Separation with your client dated 12th November 1993, our client was threatened by your client that unless she gave custody of the children as well as the matrimonial property to your client, your client would kill the children before committing suicide. Our client was put to great fear for the safety of the children and accordingly, was forced to transfer the matrimonial property to your client. In the circumstances, the transfer was under duress and may be voidable at law.
Our client instructs that all payments up to the date of transfer of the aforesaid matrimonial property was borne solely by her. Our client wants the return of the amounts paid by her for the said matrimonial property. Kindly advise your client that this shall not in any way prejudice our client's strict legal rights and our client reserves her right to any other remedy available to her at law.
Further there is no consideration for the transfer. Kindly make available to us a copy of the transfer document so that we may peruse them and advise our client accordingly. < Emphasis added. > (signed Ng Ong & Chee)
24 There followed then a lull for another 4 months. Then on 20 July 1994, the plaintiff's present solicitors wrote to the defendant's solicitors in the following terms:
As you know we act for Mdm Lim Buay Cheng. Our client instructs us that on or about 12 November 1993, she signed 2 documents at your office, one was a Deed of Separation and the other which she was not given a copy of. Our client believes that the latter document could have been a transfer referred to in the telefax of M/s Ng Ong & Chee of 7 March 1994 to yourselves.
We are instructed to put your client on notice that our client objects to the circumstances against which our client signed the said document. The factual particulars are set out in the said telefax of M/s Ng Ong & Chee of 7 March 1994 to yourselves.
Further our client did not have the benefit of independent legal advice before signing the said document.
Do also let us have a copy of the transfer document for our perusal as soon as possible. In the meantime your client must not take any steps in reliance of the said document.
< Emphasis added. > (signed Tan Lim & Tan)
25 The issues were then joined and the plaintiff commenced proceedings in this matter after filing a caveat against the property. The husband denied that he had ever threatened to break the legs of Henry Ho. He also denied that he suffered knife injuries on his chest as a result of any physical violence and explained that the only one scar found on his chest was due to a skiing accident during his stint as a student in Japan.
Solicitor's evidence
26 Mr Wan who acted for the husband in preparing the deed of separation and the transfer, confirmed the averments of the husband. He said that he took pains to explain the contents of the documents to be executed to both parties and that the wife signed them after stating that she had understood its contents. He added that he especially advised the wife about the consequences of her executing the deed of transfer and that she would thereafter have no share in the property. He further suggested that she might want to think it over before signing or to seek other opinions. However the wife's reply was: 'I understand what I am signing as I do not want to have anything to do with < the husband > .' Mr Wan stated that the wife executed the transfer voluntarily and after advice of its consequences (see paras 4 to 12 of his affidavit). Mr Wan also produced his attendance notes purportedly made on 12 November 1993 to support his foregoing averments.
27 When cross-examined as to the reasons for not specifically denying the allegations of duress raised in the wife's former solicitors' letter dated 7 March 1994, he mentioned that following the said allegations, he was in fact in telephone communication with the wife's former solicitor, Mr Chee Wai Pong and had mentioned to him that the allegations as to duress were all unfounded. As Mr Chee reportedly commented to Mr Wan that the former would cease to be acting for the wife, he did not take the matter any further (see pages 122/123 of NE). As for not forwarding a copy of the transfer, Mr Wan replied that as he was instructed at that time by the husband concerning custody of the children, he was attending to that matter and might have forgotten to transmit a copy to the wife's solicitors (see page 119 of NE).
28 Neither Mr Chee Wai Pong nor any other solicitor from the wife's former solicitors' office was called to rebut Mr Wan's averments despite a suggestion as to rebuttal evidence by the court (page 133A-B of NE). The court also noted that the wife did not at the time of the execution of the deeds or before, disclose to the husband's solicitors that she had already at the material time retained the services of a firm of solicitors.
29 The husband informed the court (page 98B of NE) that he was prepared to make an additional monetary contribution to his wife, even if he were to succeed in his defence. This offer was further confirmed by his counsel during submission that the husband would be prepared to pay the wife a sum of $180,000 voluntarily which would be in addition to his earlier payment of $61,407.44 (comprising a sum of $47,000 paid sometime in December 1993 and another sum of $14,407.44 - exh AB-143 - being refund made by him to the wife's Central Provident Fund ('CPF') account).
30 There was a peripheral dispute as to whether the wife attended at the office of Mr Wan to execute the deeds on 11 or 12 November 1993. The wife said that it was on 11 November 1993 but the husband maintained that it was on 12 November 1993. However this detail is not really material to the resolution of the issues at hand.
Conclusion
31 The main issue in this case is whether the transfer executed by the wife in favour of her husband should be set aside on grounds of undue influence or duress. The wife's contention is that she executed it solely because of her husband's threats to harm her children and his committing suicide. The husband's position on the other hand was that it was she, who in order to walk out of the marriage, voluntarily transferred the property to him after demanding the said sum of $47,000 and that there was no truth in her allegations that he threatened or coerced her into executing the deeds in question.
32 One thing that is clear from the evidence of the wife was that she had the services of a firm of solicitors and was in fact in consultation with them, well before she visited Mr Wan's office to execute the deeds. Her evidence in this regard appearing at pages 58 to 60 of the notes of evidence is noteworthy. It reads:
Q: Now about the Deed of Transfer you signed. You told the court yesterday that you went to see Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee even before you signed that Deed? A: Yes.
Q: When you went to see them first time, did you take along any document or any draft Transfer with you? A: No.
Q: What exactly did you tell your solicitor at Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee? A: I wanted him to act for me in the matter of my Deed of Separation. I also told him that my husband had threatened me with regard to the children. I told him that I had great emotional pressure from him. I told him that if I don't sign he had threatened to kill the children and commit suicide. The lawyer told me not to be frightened of him. So I told him that was easier said than done. I told him when I return to my house, I will have to face him again. That's all.
Q: Did you tell the solicitor at Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee about the Transfer? A: I did.
Q: What did you tell him about the Transfer? A: I told the lawyer that my husband wanted the whole house to be transferred to him otherwise he will harm the children.
Q: Did he give you any specific advice as regards the Transfer? A: Lawyer said I had made some contributions to the house. He advised me not to sign the Transfer at random. He asked me to bring my husband down to see him. He said he will explain to him.
Q: Did you try to bring your husband to see Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee? A: That time he already had a lawyer. So I told him that since you have a lawyer, I also have a lawyer. But he was not agreeable and he wanted me to use his lawyer.
Q: And you agreed to that? A: I had no choice as I was forced to.
Q: Notwithstanding the advice given to you, why did you still proceed to sign the Transfer? A: After my lawyers had advised me, I was not so frightened but when I went home and faced him, he gave me a lot of mental pressure. He threatened me saying that if I refused to sign the Transfer, he would kill the children and commit suicide himself and will make me feel guilty for the rest of my life.
Q: How did you react to these threats? A: I was frightened. I felt nobody could help me. I had no choice but to sign the form.
33 It would appear from her evidence that she had been in consultation with her solicitors and had been advised even from the beginning of November 1993. In reply to a question whether she gave any thought to the advice given by her solicitors before she executed the transfer deed, she replied (page 24 of NE):
I did, but after I had seen Messrs Ng, Ong & Chee my husband tortured me mentally every night. My husband begged me not to leave him; said he would kow-tow to me and if I leave him he would suffer financial difficulties; he would kill the children and commit suicide and my conscience will be troubled for the rest of my life.
34 She further confirmed that before she signed both deeds she had also the benefit of advice from the marriage counsellor who told her not to fear and to consult a good lawyer which she did (page 22A-D and 35 of NE).
35 When questioned as to the reason why she remained silent on the issue of duress for nearly four months after the execution of the transfer, she alleged that her previous solicitor did not want to handle her matter because she had signed the document against his advice (page 39 of NE).
36 It was submitted by the wife's counsel that the transfer by the wife of the matrimonial house for a consideration of $1 must be viewed with suspicion and it behoved the court to set aside the transaction for such a transfer must have been brought about by improper influence exercised by the husband. In this regard he relied on a passage from 18 Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn, para 340) where it is stated:
It is noticeable that the relation of husband and wife is not one which gives rise to the presumption that undue influence was exercised. A large gift, however, by a wife to her husband will be regarded with some degree of suspicion, and, if there is any proof that the husband exercised an improper influence, the court will be inclined to set the transaction aside. ... < Emphasis added. > 
37 Counsel argued, quoting Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barclays Bank Plc v O'Brien And Another < 1994 > 1 AC 180 at 190H and 191A, that although the relationship between the husband and wife is not one which gives rise to the presumption of undue influence, courts, due perhaps to a special tenderness of treatment afforded to wives, do recognise that 'the sexual and emotional ties between the parties provide a ready weapon for undue influence and that a wife's true wishes can easily be overborne because of her fear of destroying or damaging the wider relationship between her and her husband if she opposes his wishes.'
38 L P Thean JA in Lim Geok Hian v Lim Guan Chin < 1994 > 1 SLR 203 observed that 'undue influence is the unconscious use of one's power or authority over another to acquire a benefit or to achieve a purpose.' (page 216, supra). He said that cases of undue influence fell into two categories. First, where actual influence has been proved to have been exercised, and second, cases where by virtue of a particular relationship between the parties the court presumes that undue influence has been exercised unless the contrary is proved.
39 I was not addressed on any authority which states that there is a presumption of undue influence between a husband and wife and even the dicta by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Barclays v O'Brien (supra) referred to by counsel for the wife were predicated upon a de facto existence of a relationship under which the complainant (the wife herein) generally reposed trust and confidence in the alleged wrong-doer (see page 189H, supra) and the assumption that the wife's true wishes can be easily overborne because of her fear of destroying or damaging the wider relationship (page 198A, supra).
40 I cannot discern in this case whether the wife had any such de facto relationship as alluded to by Lord Browne- Wilkinson suggesting that she had any trust or confidence in her husband.
41 In reviewing the wife's evidence, it became apparent that the husband was decidedly in no position to influence the wife. She had a mind of her own and was intent on leaving her husband for a life outside, willy nilly the consequences. Her protestations that she was not involved with Henry Ho and that he was no more than a friend rendering gratuitous assistance to explain her health products to her English speaking customers, were spiritless and tongue-in-cheek. All the husband's pleas and to borrow a phrase from her, his 'kowtowing' to her not to abandon him and the marriage were of no avail. It was patent that she was no longer attracted to her husband whom according to her was 11 years older than her and hence the incompatability. But all said, could there be any truth in her complaint that her husband threatened to kill the children and commit suicide if she did not transfer the property.
42 On review of all the evidence, I am not persuaded that such a threat was uttered in the manner alleged by the wife and even if it was, it was unlikely that this wife whom I had the opportunity of observing in the witness box, was such a person who could be easily moved by the threat adverted to. She is, in my view, quite worldly, resourceful, hard-nosed and not a person who could be pushed around. If indeed she was, as she claimed, moved and destabilised by such threats concerning her children, she would have in all likelihood stayed home with her children at least for the time being rather than precipitously walking out of the matrimonial home despite her husband's 'kowtowing' to her.
43 At any rate, would this wife who had deemed it wise to engage in some spirited correspondence with the husband as respects access to the children from about 27 January 1994 onwards (see AB-97), have kept silent about the husband's alleged coercion and threats to kill the children for nearly four months (ie from 11 November 1993 to 7 March 1994). Her silence and inaction for such a long period despite her being represented by solicitors, belie her claim that the transfer was a result of those alleged threats on which she now tries to build her case.
Furthermore, her not calling her own solicitor to whom she had apparently related the husband's threats before and immediately after the execution of the transfer - despite a pointed reference to rebuttal evidence (page 133 of NE) - tends to weaken her assertion that such threats were indeed uttered by the husband.
44 I do not find that there was any duress or improper pressure brought to bear on her by the husband to effect the transfer now in contention. The simple truth appears to be that she wanted to be free from the marriage and hence her voluntarily and after advice, executing the deed of separation and the deed of transfer which she is now endeavouring to impugn. In this context, it should be observed that although Mr Wan should have enlisted the help of a third party to explain the contents of the deed to the wife considering the substantial asset value of the property, such a deficiency on his part does not degrade his testimony which I accept, that he in fact explained its contents and cautioned her of the consequences. The wife's omission to mention to Mr Wan that she had by then engaged the services of a firm of solicitors, further tends to undermine her veracity.
45 Another matter considered by the court is whether the transaction is inherently inequitable so that this court ought to intervene and set aside the deed of transfer. Principles of law relevant to this issue are well-encapsulated by Thean JA in Lim Geok Hian (supra) where he cites with approval the principles articulated by the English Court of Appeal in Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd and others v Total Oil GB Ltd < 1985 > 1 All ER 303. In Alec Lobb, the plaintiffs, the operators of a petrol filling station, applied to court to set aside a lease and lease-back agreement entered into with a petroleum company on the ground, inter alia, that there was inequality of bargaining power between them and that the terms of the transactions had not been shown to be fair, just and reasonable. The English Court of Appeal held that notwithstanding the inequality of bargaining power between the parties, the defendants' conduct in relation to the transaction could not be considered unconscionable, coercive or oppressive.
46 Dillon LJ commented at pages 312j and 313a:
The whole emphasis is on extortion, or undue advantage taken of weakness, an unconscientious use of the power arising out of the inequality of the parties' circumstances, and on unconscientious use of power which the court might in certain circumstances be entitled to infer from a particular, and in these days notorious, relationship unless the contract is proved to have been in fact fair, just and reasonable. Nothing leads me to suppose that the course of the development of the law over the last 100 years has been such that the emphasis on unconscionable conduct or unconscientious use of power has gone and relief will now be granted in equity in a case such as the present if there has been unequal bargaining power, even if the stronger has not used his strength unconscionably. ...
47 In the result, the court held at page 305:
... Where one party had acted extortionately, oppressively or coercively towards the other, the court would in fairness set aside a transaction so made. However, a transaction was not rendered harsh or unconscionable merely because the parties were of unequal bargaining power and the stronger party had not shown that the terms of agreement were fair, just and reasonable. Furthermore, a transaction was not unconscionable merely because a party was forced by economic necessity to make it. On the facts, although the plaintiffs had no realistic alternative, no pressure had been exerted on them by the defendant, which was reluctant to enter into the transaction, and furthermore the plaintiffs themselves had sought the defendant's assistance to avert financial collapse and had sought the prior advice of their solicitors and accountant, which they had chosen to ignore. Accordingly, the judge had been right to find that the defendant's conduct was not unconscionable or oppressive. In any event the plaintiffs' claim in equity was barred by laches. The plaintiffs' appeal would therefore be dismissed ...
48 As stated by the Privy Council in Pao On And Others v Lau Yiu Long And Others < 1980 > AC 614 at 635C-E, '<in> determining whether there was a coercion of will such that there was no true consent, it is material to inquire whether the person alleged to have been coerced did or did not protest; whether, at the time he was allegedly coerced into making the contract, he did or did not have an alternative course open to him such as an adequate legal remedy; whether he was independently advised; and whether after entering the contract he took steps to avoid it.'
49 As stated earlier, the wife in the present case had the services of legal counsel from the outset. She was advised of the consequences of her actions not only by her counsel but in my finding also by the husband's counsel. She had all the time in the world to reflect upon her actions yet she had decided to sign the deed which according to her was even against the advice of her solicitors: She did not produce any evidence from any other source to confirm her allegations that her husband had threatened to kill the children and commit suicide. At any rate, she did not even feel fit to articulate the husband's alleged threats until 7 March 1994 - about four months after the execution of the deed - although their respective solicitors were exchanging missives concerning their ongoing dispute relating to children.
50 Though the transfer mentioned a consideration of $1, the fact the husband returned to the wife a sum of $47,000 and refunded her CPF contributions including interest amounting to $14,407.44 is not disputed. The husband claimed that he was the one who bore the brunt of the financing towards the purchase of the house. The wife's evidence that she was earning about $20,000 a month as a tourist guide was not substantiated by her tax returns or pay vouchers. It was suggested to the court that her tax returns were filled in by the husband. But the fact remains that she was a signatory to the tax returns and so could not now be heard to say that she signed the returns blindly. Those who consciously embark upon evading their tax obligations by filing false returns must learn that falsehood will serve them ill in time of need. In the result I am not inclined to give credence to her claim that she was earning an average of $20,000 a month as a tourist guide. Her claim that she was the major contributor towards the purchase price of the property was not supported by credible evidence, further compounded by her prevarications and several contradictions (pages 41 to 49 of NE). By and large, I found her to be an unreliable witness who was given to improvisation. In this context, it must be mentioned that her testimony that she kept tab of all the events in her diary received a black mark and the court's disapprobation when it was discovered that all the so-called entries were made by her in a 1994 diary - all at one go (see pages 8E, 19 and 20A of NE).
51 Having regard to all the evidence, it would seem that the husband was the true homemaker whilst the wife was generally about her fun seeking activities besides being a tourist guide. I was also disposed to accept the husband's averment that the wife's actual monetary contributions towards the purchase of the property was $11,700 and an additional sum of $38,106 as against his contribution of $156,463.50.
52 The husband has already returned a sum of $61,407.44 to the wife and now undertakes to the court to pay the wife an additional sum of $180,000 to the wife even if her claim were to be rejected by the court.
53 It should be observed at this juncture that the value of the property as at 11 November 1993, as estimated by the Commissioner of Stamp Duties was $800,000. On the other hand, the valuation report by Richard Ellis submitted to the court by the wife's counsel pegged the price at $950,000 at the relevant time. The outstanding mortgage sum on the property as of 2 November 1993, as advised by counsel was about $163,000. It would appear therefore that the nett value of the property at the time the deed of transfer was signed was either $637,000 ($800,000 less $163,000 based on the Commissioner of Stamp Duties' valuation) or $787,000 ($950,000 less $163,000 based on Richard Ellis' valuation).
54 Considering the fact the husband in effect would be paying the wife a total of $241,407.44 ($61,407.44 which is already paid plus the additional proposed payment of $180,000), the wife would be receiving in fact 30.67% of the nett value of the property based on Richard Ellis' valuation ($241,407.44 787,000 x 100 = 30.67%) or 37.89% of the nett value based on the valuation by the Commissioner of Stamps ($241,407.44 637,000 x 100 = 37.89%). In my opinion, even if this matter were to be argued on the basis of the principles embodied under s 106 of the Women's Charter (Cap 353), bearing in mind the husband is the homemaker who is now left with two young children to care for and that he is the major financial contributor towards the purchase price of the property, I am of the view that the wife has been adequately compensated by the payment already made and the proposed additional payment to be made by the husband. As I observed earlier, the transfer document executed by the wife was not vitiated by any undue influence, duress or any element of unconscionability. In my finding the wife voluntarily and after receiving advice transferred the property to the husband who is in fact the true homemaker. In the premises having approved the husband's undertaking to pay the wife a further sum of $180,000 which he is hereby ordered to pay on or before 15 April 1997 or by any extension thereof as may be granted by the court, I dismiss the wife's claim herein with costs.
Dated this 15th day of November 1996.

GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The charge 1. The appellant was charged with having trafficked in 3 packets, 11 sachets and a straw of substance containing a total of not less than 49.93g of diamorphine at the premises 21, Lorong 9, Geylang, Singapore on 20 May 1996, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 ed)('the Act'). At the trial, two other charges were preferred against him, one for being in possession of 0.36 grams of diamorphine contrary to s 8(a) of the Act, and the other for consumption of diamorphine, contrary to s 8(b) of the Act. These two charges were stood down at the commencement of the trial. As for the first charge, the appellant was tried and convicted, and against his conviction he appealed. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
The prosecution's case 2. On 20 May 1996, the appellant was seen leaving No. 21 Lorong 9, Geylang and boarding a taxi. He was trailed by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau ('CNB'), and on alighting from the taxi at the car park of Crawford Lane he was arrested and was taken back to CNB headquarters. He was searched, and on him were found a sachet of heroin, the subject matter of the second charge, a sum of $12,405 in cash, and a plastic bag containing food wrappers.
3. The appellant was brought back to the room at No. 21, Lorong 9, Geylang ('the room'), which he rented but which he persistently denied was occupied by him. However, he was identified by the chief tenant of the premises, Wong Kin Sian ('Wong'), as the person who had agreed to rent the room on 9 May 1996 at $600 per month. The appellant, who introduced himself to Wong as 'Tan Thong', had paid Wong $1,200, comprising one month's rent in advance and one month's rent as deposit. He moved in on 12 May 1996.
4. The room was searched by the CNB officers. Although the appellant denied that he was the occupant of the room, there was a photograph of him displayed on top of the television set. There was also a built-in wardrobe and a free-standing chest of Drawers, both of which were locked. A set of keys were found on the floor, and one of the keys was used to unlock one of the two padlocks securing the wardrobe. The appellant denied that he had the remaining keys, as he maintained that he was not staying there. The remaining locks were then broken open by the CNB officers. Inside the wardrobe were found a soft bag and a cardboard box. The bag contained stacks of astic sachets, a mini-weighing scale, a mobile link card, a mobile telephone warranty card and a pair of tweezers. The cardboard box contained, among other things, a sachet and a straw of granular substance believed to be heroin, a cigarette tin-foil and cigarette smoking related items.
5. As for the chest of drawers, it contained three packets, seven sachets in a brown envelope and three sachets in a blue envelope, all containing granular substance believed to be heroin. There ere also a lighter, an inhaler, empty plastic sachets, a metal spoon, a mini weighing-scale and a sum of $784 in cash.
6. These substances were seized and were later sent to the Department of Scientific Services ('DSS') for analysis. They were analysed and were found to contain 49.93 grams of diamorphine with a purity ranging from 4% to 7.8%. According to Dr Saw Chwee Guan who carried out the analysis, as long as the range was within 5%, the DSS would normally regard the samples as having originated from the same batch of drugs.
7. On the evening of 20 May, the appellant was sent to Alexandra Hospital for a pre-statement medical examination. He was then warded at Changi Hospital for further observation for drug withdrawal symptoms. He recovered well enough to be discharged on 23 May 1996.
8. Following this, the appellant made a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)('the CPC') on 23 May, the accuracy and admissibility of which were not challenged. In it he said as follows:
The heroin kept in the room is for my own consumption. I suffer from serious asthma, so I smoke heroin to ease my asthma attacks. I bought this heroin and kept it in the room I rented, a few days before my arrest. I bought this large amount of heroin, was because it was cheaper and I don't have to go out often to buy the heroin. This is my first offence and I am still young, and I hope that I will not be sentenced to death.
9. A statement was recorded on 28 May under s 121 of the CPC. Again, the accuracy and admissibility of this statement were not challenged. In it, the appellant explained how he had come into possession of the drugs. He said, inter alia, as follows:
2 I am a urine absconder reporting to Tanglin Police Station. I have absconded from urine test since October 1994. I have been on the run since. My daily rate of consumption of heroin is about one sachet of heroin. I am a heavy consumer of heroin. I take heroin because of my asthmatic condition which is a serious one. If I do not take the heroin I get my asthma attacks very often. .... 4 Somewhere around the 10th May 1996, I rented a room through a property agent known to me as Ah Kim, at No 21 Lorong 9, Geylang. I agreed to pay the landlord $600/- a month for the room at the said place at the 2nd storey. I moved into the room two days later as the landlord Mr Wong told me that the room would only be available in 2 days' time.... I seldom went out of the room. I usually stay in the room to smoke my heroin. ..... All the heroin that was recovered in the table drawer on 20th May 96, by the CNB officers belong to me. The two and half packets of heroin which were recovered in the drawer belongs to me. It is for my own consumption. The 10 sachets of heroin which were also in the same drawer also belongs to me. I usually smoke the heroin by method of chasing the dragon. I can finish up to one sachet of heroin a day and sometimes even more depending on my asthmatic condition. I seldom go out of the room. ....
7 I have been unemployed since the day I absconded from my urine test somewhere in October 1994. I did strike lottery on about 4 occasions since May 95 till March 96. The first occasion I strike $5000/-. The second occasion I strike $7500/-, the third occasion $3250/- and the last occasion I strike $500/-. This was somewhere in March 96. All these were legal bettings. I had also won something in the region of $40,000/- in my illegal bettings with bookies at Kempas Road coffeeshop. This was the reason why I had a lot of money with me during the time of my arrest. This money I had with me was the remainder of my winnings. I do not sell heroin. I only kept the large amount of heroin as I had the money to buy it. It was also cheaper for me to get the heroin in bulk.
8 .... About 3 days after I had moved in to the room at Lorong 9, Geylang I met my friend known to me as Ah Kok at the Katong Shopping Centre. I bought the 2 pounds of heroin from Ah Kok at $4000/-. I took the heroin and came back to my room and kept it in the table drawer which I had bought the previous day.... I gave Ah Kok $4000/-. Ah Kok then gave me a plastic bag. In the plastic bag was a big bundle wrapped in newspaper. I did not examine it at that place. I straight away brought the plastic bag containing the heroin to my room at No 21, Lorong 9. Geylang. In my room I examined the newspaper wrapping. I the saw that it was 2 packets of heroin. Since I had my own ration of heroin I did not touch this heroin in the newspaper wrapping.
About 2 days later, I took the 1/2 packet of heroin from the newspaper wrapping which Ah Kok gave me and I took some of the heroin from the packet and converted some of the heroin into 15 sachets of heroin. I then put the remaining packet of heroin back into the table drawer. I then also placed 14 sachets of heroin back into the same drawer. I smoked one sachet of heroin that day.
9 From the 17 of May 96 until the day of my arrest on 20 May 96, I smoked another 4 sachets of heroin. I had a emainder of 10 sachets of heroin together with the other 2 packets plus of heroin which was in the drawer at the time of my arrest.
The defence's case 10. The appellant's defence was that all the drugs which were found in the room were for his own personal consumption. The appellant started taking drugs in 1987. In October 1993, he was arrested and detained in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre ('DRC'). After his release, he had to report for urine tests but he defaulted in October 1994. He resumed his heroin addiction, initially consuming only a straw a day but he became more addicted until he was able to consume half a sachet a day.
11. In 1995, he was afflicted with asthma. Wherever he smoked a small quantity of drugs he would have an asthmatic attack. Thus he took more of the drugs, which he claimed helped to relieve his congested respiratory tubes and lungs. He claimed that in May 1996, his rate of consumption was one sachet of drugs a day. When he had an asthmatic attack, he would sometimes consume an additional sachet.
12. As for the empty plastic sachets, which totalled around 900 pieces in different sizes, he used them to pack a sachet of drugs each time so that he could use it when he went out. He explained that the digital weighing scales were used to weigh jewellery when punters pawned them with him to borrow money. He also used the scales to weigh the drugs to see his rate of consumption per day, which was 8 grams per sachet.
13. The appellant also explained were he got the money to finance his drug addiction. In May 1996, he was not working, but he had savings of about $20,000, as he had struck lottery four times. This was subsequently confirmed by evidence of four winning lottery tickets, and two of the prizes were $5,000 and $7,500, but there was no evidence of how much the other two prizes were worth. The appellant also claimed that he had won about $40,000 from illegal betting, but he did not produce any evidence of this.
14. The rest of the appellant's defence was essentially a repeat of what he had stated in his s 121 and s 122 statements. The appellant admitted that he rented the room at No 21 Geylang Road. He also explained why he had bought the drugs in such a large quantity from Ah Kok. He claimed that the price for two and a half packets at $4,000 was cheap, and that with an asthmatic condition he needed the drugs to relieve him of his asthma.
The expert medical evidence on the rate of consumption 15. Both the prosecution and defence called expert witnesses in aid of their cases. Dr Lim Yun Chin, a private consultant psychiatrist at Raffles Surgical Centre and a Visiting Consultant to the Singapore General Hospital, testified on behalf of the appellant. His past experiences with drug addicts were as follows. He was a psychiatrist at the Drug Rehabilitation Centres from 1983 to 1989. He was also the Prison (Forensic) Psychiatrist attached to Changi Prison Hospital from 1988 to 1989 where he gained his clinical experience with drug addicts. When he was working as a clinical trainee and registrar from 1980 to 1982, he had hands-on experience in dealing with drug addiction including managing patients suffering from acute heroin withdrawal. In addition, he was also a member of certain governmental committees relating to drug addiction and rehabilitation.
16. In addition, Dr Lim had come into contact with drug addicts whilst he was a psychiatrist at the DRCs as well as outside the DRC, and he had been told by addicts that they were capable of consuming a sachet or even one and a half sachets per day without experiencing any overdose effects.
17. Dr Lim's opinion concerning the appellant's ability and rate of consumption was based on the latter's general profile, in particular, on various medical reports on the appellant, which he had an opportunity to peruse. He did not, however, examine the appellant.
18. Dr Lim was of the opinion that the appellant was able to escalate his daily consumption from zero in October 1994 to 1 sachet a day at the time of his arrest without any adverse side- effects or an overdose. He came to his conclusion based on the following information. First, the appellant's age, which was just 25. Second, he had a past history of drug consumption and was arrested and detained in DRC. Third, after he absconded from urine tests, he resumed his drug consumption. Moreover, the tolerance developed in a person who consumed drugs and the ability to take a higher dosage of drugs would be faster for someone who had a past history of drug consumption, as opposed to a person who was a fresh addict or a newcomer. However, Dr Lim admitted that based on the information above, he could not say whether the appellant was a mild, moderate or severe addict.
19. Dr Lim then sought to explain the correlation between the withdrawal symptoms exhibited and the degree of addiction. In his opinion, the withdrawal symptoms only indicated the severity of withdrawal. The severity of withdrawal symptoms had no simple direct correlation with the amount of drugs consumed by the appellant. Instead, the degree of addiction of a drug addict was based on psychological and social parameters. The factors affecting the severity of withdrawal symptoms were (a) the total amount of heroin taken, (b) the duration and regularity of use, (c) psychological factors such as his expectation that his suffering will be alleviated by consumption of drugs, (d) the addict's personality and state of mind, and (e) the addict's general physical health, age and ability to handle stress. One of the psychological factors that influenced the symptoms was that if the addict knew that he could obtain relief or medication, then he would exhibit more withdrawal symptoms. Conversely, if he knew that there was no such hope of getting to such a relief, ie. the heroin, then he would not exhibit severe withdrawal symptoms.
The prosecution's expert testimony 20. The prosecution called two witnesses to rebut the defence that the drugs were meant solely for the appellant's personal consumption. First, there was Dr Leow Kee Fong, who is currently a registrar at the Changi Prison Hospital. His past experiences included his service at the various DRCs, such as at Selarang Park, Jalan Awan and Sembawang. His job included monitoring the rehabilitative treatment and progress of drug addicts. He estimated that between 1981 to 1982, he had examined a thousand inmates suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms and hundreds more from June 1988 to November 1992.
21. Dr Leow examined the appellant's condition from 21 to 23 May 1996. Based on his experience with drug addicts, he classified the degree of addiction according to the physical aspects of the addiction. Unlike Dr Lim, Dr Leow was of the opinion that the severity of withdrawal symptoms had a direct correlation with the amount of drugs consumed by the appellant. Thus the number of signs and symptoms, its frequency and severity would increase as one progresses from a mild to a moderate and lastly to a severe addict.
22. Dr Leow testified that from his observations of drug addicts between 1988 to 1991, addicts suffering from mild withdrawal symptoms tended to consume approximately 1 to 2 straws of heroin per day, those with moderate symptoms 3 to 5 straws and those with is was based on a straw of 3 cm in length with a gross weight of between 0.2 to 0.3 gram of heroin with a purity of 15%.
On the average, a sachet of heroin weighed between 7 to 8 grams. A mild addict would suffer from drug withdrawal syndrome for a period of three to four days, whereas a moderate addict would suffer for a period up to seven days, and a severe addict's suffering could last for a period up to ten days. or a mild addict, the withdrawal symptoms would set in approximately 8 to 12 hours after the last dosage and would normally last three to four days, peaking 24 to 48 hours after setting in.
23. Reverting to the appellant, Dr Leow referred to the withdrawal symptoms and signs as exhibited by the appellant on the night of 20 May 1996, as recorded by one Dr Michael Chong, who examined the appellant on that night at Alexandra Hospital.
When Dr Chong examined the appellant on that night, he was found with running nose, tremors and yawning. However, when the appellant was examined on 21 and 22 May, he had no more signs of heroin withdrawal, although he complained of diarrhoea on two occasions, vomiting three or four times, insomnia and some abdominal pains. His condition, as observed by Dr Leow on those two days, was generally fair. He was alert and there was no tearing or running nose; there was minimal goose flesh and his pupils were only slightly dilated. Moreover the appellant was not dehydrated and his abdominal condition was normal.
24. On 23 May, Dr Leow examined the appellant again and found that apart from feeling a bit of weakness, there were no other complaints from the appellant; nor clinically were there any withdrawal signs. Thus Dr Leow found that the signs had completely subsided and discharged him. Based on the observation of the appellant over those days, Dr Leow categorised him as a mild addict, as he showed only mild withdrawal symptoms.
25. The prosecution also submitted the appellant's DRC records which showed the appellant's degree of addiction when he was being treated at the DRC. The appellant was first referred to the DRC in December 1987, where one of the doctors found him to have suffered from mild heroin withdrawal, whilst another doctor who examined him at the same time did not see enough evidence to suggest that he was having heroin withdrawal. Thus he was released after a week's stay at the DRC. He was sent in again in October 1993 and this time both doctors found him to have mild heroin withdrawal.
26. The second witness called by the prosecution to rebut the appellant's defence that the drugs were for his personal consumption was ASP Lim Chei Yoo from CNB. He was called to elaborate on the practice of drug users and suppliers, as well as the street value of the drugs. Based on the data which he had compiled ASP Lim opined that for the month of May 1996 (the same month in which the present offence was committed), the average gross weight per straw was 0.22 gram of heroin and the average weight of diamorphine was 0.015 gram. The purity level was 6.9%.
27. ASP Lim also told the court that the drugs seized from the appellant had a street value of $65,704 if sold as 'suku' straws, i.e. straws. He pointed out that it was rare for heroin addicts to purchase drugs in sachets. One could only do so if one had the sources and the money. Normally, the drug distributors would purchase the drugs in pounds and repack them into sachets for distribution. In turn, those who purchased drugs from these distributors in sachets were known as 'ant traffickers'. The average price of a sachet of heroin weighing 8 grams would be between $120 and $150.
The trial judge's decision 28. As the appellant was proved to have drugs in his possession, under s 17 of the Act he was presumed to have the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The burden was on him to rebut the presumption that the drugs he had were not for the purpose of trafficking. The trial judge held that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption.
29. In coming to this conclusion the trial judge accepted Dr Leow's testimony that the appellant was only a mild addict whose rate of consumption was 0.1 gram of diamorphine of 1 to 2 straws of heroin per day. He considered that Dr Lim's evidence that a person with the appellant's profile, both psychological and physical, could consume one sachet of heroin of 8 grams per day was not of any assistance. Next, the trial judge found the appellant to be an unreliable witness and unworthy of belief.
30. The trial judge also found that the paraphernalia in the appellant's room were evidence of a person trafficking in drugs. There were too many empty sachets, which could not have been used merely for storing drugs for his own individual consumption. The appellant also admitted that the weighing scales were used to weigh his own sachets to make sure that they weighed 8 grams each.
The appeal 31. The only issue before us was whether on the totality of the evidence, the appellant had rebutted the presumption under s 17.
32. The appellant sought to rely on Dr Lim's evidence. But his evidence, as found by the trial judge, was not of any assistance. Dr Lim's evidence was merely that a person with the appellant's profile, both physical and psychological, could consume a quantity of heroin up to a sachet of 8 grams a day, or even one and a half sachets. But, he did not even examine the appellant, nor did he produce any evidence of cases in which this occurrence had happened.
33. In our opinion, it was not enough merely to show that someone in the appellant's shoes could have consumed so much heroin. In order to show that the drugs were for his own personal consumption and thus to rebut the presumption of trafficking, the person such as the appellant had to show that probably he consumed that amount of drugs i a day. It was not shown from Dr Lim's theory that a person's daily consumption could escalate from zero to 1 sachet a day over a short period of time without adverse side-effects or overdose would probably apply to a case such as the appellant. Indeed, Dr Lim was unable to categorise the appellant as a mild, moderate or severe addict.
34. The trial judge accepted the evidence of Dr Leow and found that the appellant was only a mild drug addict. In coming to his conclusion the trial judge gave careful consideration to the conflicting expert evidence. He said:
I was sure that the accused was only a mild addict. His rate of consumption was 0.1 gram of diamorphine of 1-2 straws of heroin per day. His mild withdrawal symptoms set in Approximately 8-12 hours after the last dosage. It would normally last 3-4 days, peaking 24-48 hours after setting in. This was what happened to the accused on the night of 20 May 96. Dr Michael Chong who examined him found that clinically the accused presented yawning, running nose and tremors. He was not sure that the accused was a drug addict but he had sufficient grounds to have referred him to Changi Prison Hospital. Dr Leow examined him at 9.20 am on 21 May 96. The accused complained of diarrhoea on two occasions and having vomited 3 times. He also complained of backache and having hot sensation. His general condition, however, was good. He was alert. There was no tearing or running nose. He had minimum goose flesh. Dr Leow examined him again on 22 May 96 at 9 am. The accused complained of having vomited once, insomnia and some lower abdominal pain. Clinically, his general condition was satisfactory. His pupils were normal in size. He was not dehydrated. He was last examined by Dr Leow at 9.30 am on 23 May 96. He was feeling a bit of body weakness. Clinically, his general condition was satisfactory. He had no running nose, tearing or goose flesh. Dr Leow then discharged him that day and CNB resumed custody of the accused. Dr Lim's evidence that a person with his profile, both sychological and physical, could consume one sachet of heroin (of 8 grams) was not of any assistance. Dr Lim opined that the accused was capable of consuming 1 to 1 1/2 sachet of heroin based on the diamorphine content of between 0.28 gram and 0.50 gram of diamorphine.
35. We agreed with the trial judge. Dr Leow had examined and observed the appellant for three days before coming to his conclusion. Prior to that, the appellant was examined by Dr Michael Chong, on the very day on which the offence was Vommitted. Moreover, Dr Leow was able to explain, based on his past experience with addicts, the various symptoms, its severity and its duration, which was related to whether a person was a mild, moderate or severe addict.
36. There was also other evidence which was damning to the appellant's case. The first related to the paraphernalia found in his room. There were over 900 empty sachets comprising three different types, which the appellant claimed that he used to contain a small quantity of heroin whenever he went out. This explanation was wholly unconvincing in view of the sheer number of sachets. Then, there were more than 400 envelopes of five different sizes, to which no credible explanation of why he needed that quantity was proffered. Further, there were two digital weighing scales, which the appellant claimed were used to weigh the drugs so that he could pack them in sachets of 8 grams each for his consumption. We found it hard to believe that he would have weighed the drugs so accurately, if he merely wanted to use them for his personal consumption. The presence of these paraphernalia was consistent with a person who was buying the drugs for redistribution.
37. In addition, there was insufficient evidence to show that the appellant could have maintained his expensive habit of addiction. The appellant was not in regular employment and despite having won lottery prizes amounting to about $20,000, there was no evidence that he had also won $40,000 from illegal betting. Lastly, the trial judge found that the appellant was evasive and unworthy of credit. We had no reason to disagree with the trial judge.
38. On the totality of the evidence, we were unanimously agreed that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

2 The plaintiff averred that despite numerous requests and reminders, the defendant had failed to repay the loan and hence this action.
3 The defendant denied the plaintiff's allegations and in the defence filed he said that the four cheque payments detailed by the plaintiff totalling $620,000 were in fact repayments by the plaintiff to the defendant of two loans given by him to the plaintiff in February and May 1990 amounting to $600,000 including an element of interest amounting to $20,000.
4 The principal issue before the court was whose evidence had the ring of truth or alternatively whose version had the cogency or the appearance of conformity to probabilities. Since the question to be decided revolved around credibility and the acceptance of one's evidence against the other, it is necessary to set out in some detail the testimonies of the parties in this action.
Plaintiff's version
5 He is currently the director of a company known as Kawin Knitting Pte Ltd ('Kawin') and had known the defendant for more than eight years. He became acquainted with the defendant in the course of business as they were both dealing in textiles and garments. The remainder of his evidence surrounding the circumstances in which he had reportedly loaned $620,000 to the defendant is best stated in his own words, as contained in paras 2 to 19 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, and they read as follows:
2. When the business dealings between Kawin and Beauty Joy first started, I was the one who would go over to Koh's office ... to solicit for orders ...
3. ... In time, we got to know each other ... I therefore respected and trusted him both as a friend and as a customer.
4. Sometime in early March 1990, Koh called me over the phone at my office and told me that he needed a loan of S$100,000.00 for his business. He invited me over to his office for a discussion. On that occasion, Koh told me that he needed the money to purchase stock-lot goods for resale. Koh did not elaborate on his business plans ...
5. ... I felt that it would not be too risky to lend S$100,000.00 to Koh as per his request since the same could be repaid very soon. After consideration, I finally agreed to lend Koh S$100,000.00. He is afterall my friend and I wanted to help him. This loan of S$100,000.00 was by way of my personal OUB Cheque No. 330120 dated 8th March 1990 which I personally handed over to Koh at his office. At that time I did not think it was necessary to request Koh for an IOU note as I trusted Koh and also felt that my said cheque, which was a crossed cheque made payable to Koh, would be sufficient evidence of the said loan.
5A. Shortly after, in late March 1990, Koh again called me at my office and told me he needed another loan of S$100,000.00 and requested that I go over to his office to discuss the same. When I pointed out that the first loan of S$100,000.00 had not yet been repaid, Koh explained that this was because the stock-lot goods which he had purchased with the first loan had not been sold off completely yet. I accepted this explanation in view of the short time since the first loan was extended. Koh then went on to explain that the second loan would again be for the purchase of stock-lot goods but this time for resale in Batam.
6. Koh further explained that his banking arrangements have not been finalised yet but the seller of the goods was insisting on immediate cash payment for the goods. From my experience, it was indeed true that sellers of stock-lot goods always insist on cash payments up front. Though Koh did not give me any details of the seller, the goods or his bank, I did not expect him to do so as these would be his confidential business information. Anyway, it was completely up to me whether I trusted him or not.
7. From my personal experience, I estimated conservatively that stock-lot goods could fetch about 3 times their purchase price in Batam and the same could also be completely sold off in about 6 weeks. Hence, if I extend the loan to Koh, I was confident that Koh would be able to repay me in a short period of time. As I trusted Koh and felt that his purported business intention is viable and not too risky, I finally decided to extend a second loan of S$100,000.00 to Koh to help him in his business as a friend. This second loan was by way of my personal OUB Cheque No. 330121 dated 24th March 1990 which I again personally handed over to Koh at his office. Again, I did not request Koh for an IOU note as I felt that my said cheque, which was a crossed cheque made payable to Koh would be sufficient evidence of the loan.
8. Then sometime in mid June 1990, Koh again called me at my office and told me that he needed a third loan, this time amounting to S$300,000.00 and requested that I go over to his office for a discussion. When I reminded him again that so far, he had not repaid me for both the first and the second loan totalling S$200,000.00, he replied that that was because the stock-lot goods had not been sold off completely yet. He assured me that once the goods were sold off, he would repay me the money.
9. Koh then went on to inform me that he has a friend from Taiwan who manufactures jackets; that his friend's company is doing very well in Europe; that his friend's company has business operations and factories in Malaysia and that his friend's company also has a factory here in Singapore at Pak Cheong Building, Playfair Road. Koh also told me that due to business cum staff expansion, his friend's office has to shift out of the said factory and be relocated elsewhere. As such, his friend is planning to buy an office space.
10. Koh then revealed to me that he is planning to buy an office space at Peninsula Plaza jointly with his friend and then rent it out to his friend's company to earn rental income. Koh told me that he needed S$300,000.00 cash up front for the deposit, legal costs, stamp fees, renovation costs, broker's commission etc. and he persuaded me to lend him the same. When I suggested that he borrow the money from the Bank, Koh told me that he would still need money up front for the deposit and that if he could settle all preliminary matters first, he could also borrow more from the bank and the loan application can also be processed faster which was crucial to his business venture with William < Wu > . In short, he gave me numerous reasons why it would be more advantageous if he had money upfront and reassured me that once the financial arrangements with his Bankers were finalised, he will repay me the S$300,000.00 within the month. He also stressed to me that this was a rare business opportunity for him which he cannot afford to miss and persuaded me to help him. Koh sounded very sincere and urgent.
11. On that occasion, though Koh did not tell me his friend's name or the name of his friend's company, he did show me numerous documents supposedly being materials on the office space which Koh was intending to buy jointly with his friend but I merely gave them a cursory glance and did not take copies of them since I did not doubt Koh's genuinity. Since the purpose of this third loan was for buying property, I felt that there was not much risk in lending Koh the S$300,000.00 he requested for. This third loan was by my personal OUB Cheque No. 383632 dated 14th June 1990 which I again handed over personally to Koh at his office. Again, I did not request Koh for an IOU note as I felt that my said cheque, which was again a crossed cheque made payable to Koh would be sufficient evidence of the loan.
12. After about one month when Koh still had not repaid me the total sum of S$500,000.00, I then went to his office to look for him to ask for repayment. Koh then explained that both the Banking arrangements and the sale and purchase of the office space have not been finalised yet and therefore he had no choice but to delay repayment to me. On this occasion, Koh first informed me that his friend's name is William Wu.
13. Thereafter, I went to Koh's office again on a few other occasions to press Koh for repayment of the loans then totalling S$500,000.00 but each time Koh would give me various excuses like he had not finished selling the stock-lot goods yet, payments for those goods sold had not been received yet, William Wu had not agreed with him on all the various details of their proposed agreement regarding the said office space yet, his banking arrangements had not been finalised yet etc.
14. As I kept pressing Koh for repayment, Koh finally decided to introduce me to William Wu and to show me William Wu's business operations probably to allay my fear that Koh may default on repayment. He told me that William Wu's business is very big and therefore I should not worry about the loans. Once everything is finalised between him and William Wu, he would surely repay me the loans. Hence sometime in September 1990, Koh brought me to meet William Wu at his factory at Pak Cheong Building. As William Wu was busy then, he did not talk much to me. Koh showed me around William Wu's factory premises and I estimated the same to contain about 8,000 square feet of factory space. I therefore felt somewhat more reassured.
15. However, I still insisted that Koh give me a more definite indication as to when I can expect to receive repayments for the said loans. I visited Koh at his office on a couple of occasions after the said visit to William Wu's factory and insisted that Koh let me know exactly when he would repay the said loans. In fact, I almost lost my patience with Koh and I even warned him that unless he gave me a definite indication forthwith, I may proceed to sue him. < Emphasis added. > 
16. Despite pressure from me, Koh was still unable/unwilling to give me any definite indications. Instead, he would plead with me for more time everytime I visited him and demanded for repayments. At the material time, he would give me many excuses which sounded very reasonable and plausible then. It did not occur to me then that Koh would ultimately choose to deny the loans. At that time, I felt that Koh genuinely needed more time to make repayments so I decided to grant him more time.
17. This matter therefore dragged on until late October 1990 when I again went to look for Koh at his office to demand for repayment. This time instead of asking for more time, Koh told me that he needed another loan of S$120,000.00 to complete the renovations at the said office space or else even he would not know what might become of his agreement with William Wu. In the event, he may not even be in a financial position to repay the loans then amounting to S$500,000.00.
18. When I heard this, I became very worried that if I do not extend a further loan of S$120,000.00 to Koh, the chances of Koh repaying me the existing loans amounting to S$500,000.00 would be jeopardized. After consideration, I finally decided to extend a final loan of S$120,000.00 to Koh as afterall, I had already loan (sic) him a total sum of S$500,000.00 which was much more than what he was asking for now. I was hoping that by lending him this final S$120,000.00 he may then be able to repay me in full. This fourth and final loan was by way of my personal OUB Cheque No. 438203 dated 23rd November 1990 which I again personally handed over to Koh at his office. Again, I did not ask Koh for an IOU note as I felt that my said cheque, which was a crossed cheque made payable to Koh would be sufficient evidence of the loan. ...
19. Despite my concerted efforts in trying to get Koh to repay me the four (4) loans totalling S$620,000.00, I had been unable to do so as Koh started avoiding me altogether after taking the final loan of S$120,000.00. It became increasingly difficult to find him at his office or contact him over the phone. Of course there were still times when I managed to get hold of Koh as I go to Da Jin Factory Building very often as mentioned earlier, but he would always give me various excuses and reasons why repayment is delayed and would also reassure me that he would do his best to repay me. He begged me to be patient and to give him more time.
6 The plaintiff provided documentary evidence to support that he issued the said four cheques and that he transferred on various dates, funds from his savings as well as fixed deposit accounts to his current account in order to underpin the cheques issued by him.
The defendant's version
7 The defendant in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief mentioned that he had known the plaintiff since about 1985 and had been having business dealings with him ever since. He claimed that his company Beauty Joy Garments Manufacturing and Trading Co ('Beauty Joy') used to buy cloth from the plaintiffs' company, Kawin and there was a mutual account between the respective companies. He claimed that he had never borrowed any money from the plaintiff and whatever payments he had received from the plaintiff were in fact repayment of loans given by him to the plaintiff as well as an interest element of $20,000. As to the circumstances relating to the dispute at hand, it is useful to reproduce the relevant portions of the defendant's averments in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief and they read as follows:
18. In 1990, Goh borrowed from me two sums of money amounting to a total sum of $600,000. I lent the money to him and was repaid the loans within the same year. The loans occurred during the time period when Goh and I had existing business dealings under the names of our respective enterprises.
19. It is not true that the sum of $600,000 or, as Goh has corrected his initial position, $620,000 is borrowed by me. I did not borrow the money or any money at all from Goh. He did.
20. In February 1990, while Goh was in my office, he asked me whether I would be able to lend him a sum of money for the purpose of helping his good friend. He wanted a sum of $200,000 and needed it urgently. The repayment period will be short about a month later.
21. Seeing that I was a bit reserved (sic) from his request, Goh said that I should not worry too much because I could contra the loan from the sale prices of the cloth if the loan is not repaid.
22. I decided to lend the money to him after I have considered a few factors. First, we have business dealings together. I have a number of orders then for the supply of cloth to be delivered in the future. We have grown to be friends from the business dealings together. Second, the repayment period is short and I could contra the loan. Third, although the ultimate user of the money is another person, I would still be looking to Goh for repayment. Goh had told me that he would be responsible for the repayment of the loan.
23. I agreed to lend Goh the money and asked him to return to my office the next day for the money. I asked him to issue a cheque to me and post-date it. He said that it would be difficult for him to know exactly the date for repayment of the money to me and that it would be better to write an IOU note to me. I accepted his suggestion.
24. The next day, I got the cash ready for Goh's collection. He came to my office and collected it. He handed to me a handwritten note of acknowledgement for the first loan ( 1st IOU note ). It was the IOU note which had been mentioned yesterday. I do not read English well but I could see the sum of $200,000 and the name of Goh Kim Huang written in such a way that he owes me etc. Goh explained briefly the contents of the note to me. His explanation touched on the assurance that I could contra the loan from the sales. I kept the note.
25. On 8 March 1990, Goh came to my office to deliver 2 cheques as repayment of the loan. He said to me that the sum of $200,000 is repaid by 2 instalments. The first instalment was paid by the cheque dated 8 March 1990 and the second by the cheque dated 24 March 1990. Each cheque had been made to the amount of $100,000 and both cheques were given to me on the same day. Goh said that the 2nd instalment would be paid within 2 weeks from the 1st instalment. Hence, the second cheque was dated 24 March 1990. ...
26. In exchange for the cheques, Goh asked for the return of the 1st IOU note. I returned it to him. I did not keep any copy of the note. Goh mentioned that he would be receiving payment from his end of the transaction.
27. After this loan, our business dealings continued. He still visited me at my office as usual.
28. In May 1990, Goh asked me for another loan. He asked me for a larger sum than the previous one. It was for $400,000. He said that the loan is needed for the purpose of money earn money . As far as I understand, Goh would be using the money borrowed from me to earn money for himself. I hesitated. He offered to pay me a sum of money as interest for the use of money. His rationale was that if money could be earned by this loan he would like me to benefit from it too. As it is, the money will come from me. He also used the same assurance to me when he had borrowed the previous loan from me. He assured me that I could contra the loan from the prices of the sale invoices if the loan is not repaid.
29. The interest was a sum of $20,000 which is equivalent to 5% of the principal sum of $400,000. Goh added further that the repayment period would be longer than the earlier one and also by instalments.
30. I considered this request. In my mind, the thought occurred that it is an opportunity to make a sum of money because of the interest. I pondered a while and decided to lend Goh the money. I agreed to lend the money because Goh had borrowed from me once without any problem of repayment and I had existing business dealings with him. Moreover, on this occasion, I would be benefitting with a return of interest.
31. Goh wanted the money by the next day. But I told him that I would need a few days to get ready the cash. I prepared the money and handed it over to him. Again, Goh gave me a note of acknowledgement for the second loan ( 2nd IOU note ). He explained briefly to me the contents of the note. In it, the assurance about getting a contra for the repayment of the loan and the interest of $20,000 were mentioned.
32. On 14 June 1990, Goh came to my office. He brought along a cheque dated the same date for the sum of $300,000 and handed it over to me. Goh told me that he is repaying the loan with this sum initially and will repay the balance together with the interest sometime in November 1990. I received the cheque and presented it for payment on the same day.
33. On 23 November 1990, Goh came with a cheque dated the same date for the sum of $120,000. The sum included the interest due to me. In handing over the cheque to me, Goh got back the 2nd IOU note from me. Copies of the two cheques have been annexed to the Plaintiff's 1st affidavit (filed 26/01/94) as part of the Exhibit GKK 2 .
34. The two loans borrowed by Goh were repaid. Goh and I continued to have business dealings with each other. Our business dealings dwindled in later years. The reason for the decline in business dealings between us is attributable to the rising labour costs of manufacturing wearing apparel in Singapore. Beauty Joy switched its business focus to trading in wearing apparel. The firm imported finished products into Singapore for sale increasingly. Subsequently, the time arrived when Goh and I did not transact any business with each other.
8 With a view to persuading the court that the plaintiff's allegations were not borne out by events that occurred in the course of 1992, the defendant further said in his affidavit:
59. Goh stated in his 1st affidavit that I had started avoiding < him > altogether after taking the final loan of $120,000 . (see Plaintiff's 1st affidavit filed 26/01/94 para 18 at page 9). Using the time of the alleged loan in November 1990 as a point of reference, such alleged behaviour on my part would be occurring after November 1990.
60. I have two points to refute this allegation. One, our business dealings continued until 1992. The business documents show the continuity of our dealings after November 1990. Goh still visited me at my office after November 1990 as evidenced from the business documents. Two, in June 1992, Goh asked me to bring a Rolex watch for servicing. He handed over the Rolex watch and said that he would reimburse me for the bill later. The watch is a Rolex King with studded diamonds on it and is worth about $20,000. I got the watch for servicing at the Rolex Service Centre and returned it to Goh. I paid for the bill first and received payment from Goh later. Goh paid me by way of his cheque dated 26 June 1992 for the sum of $257.10. The original bill is with Goh and I obtained a copy of it from the Rolex Service Centre for the purpose of this case. Goh and I met a few times during this period of getting the Rolex watch serviced. During the meetings, Goh could have asked me for repayment of the loans if I had borrowed money from him. But he did not. I did not borrow any money from him at all. Goh would not have entrusted the watch to me during the time when I am still owing him money from the alleged loans. It is not sensible for a sane person to do so.
61. As for the purported business partner in the purchase of the commercial property, William Wu, a friend from Taiwan who manufactures jackets (see the Plaintiff's 1st affidavit 26/01/94 para 8 at page 4), I did not and do not have any business venture with him. Goh knows William Wu because both of them, including myself, are in the same trade of garment manufacturing and trading. I did not bring Goh to William Wu's factory at Pak Cheong Building at Playfair Road and, if Goh had wanted to visit William Wu's factory, I do not need to bring him there because Goh knows William Wu.
62. My defence to Goh's claim is that Goh did not lend any money to me. I lent money to him and received payment from the loans. I have stated the facts in support of my defence.
9 The defendant's wife, Tan Lee Huang, testified that she had known the plaintiff since 1985 and had met him over the years in the course of assisting her husband in his business. She said that although she had met the plaintiff a few times in 1992, he had never once mentioned to her about her husband's alleged indebtedness to the plaintiff.
10 The defendant's father was an eleventh hour witness for the defence.
11 His evidence was relevant only in relation to the defendant's averment that he borrowed a sum of $200,000 from his father to lend to the plaintiff. There was no doubt an initial hesitation on the part of the defendant to call his father. The court was told that he was about 80 years of age and was not in the best of health. Observing a measure of ambivalence on the part of the defence to call or not to call the father, the court inquired, before defence counsel closed his case but at any rate before the plaintiff was recalled, whether the defendant would be calling his father to testify. In this connection it is useful to remember that a judge's right to ascertain the truth is necessarily circumscribed by the rules of evidence and in civil litigation a judge has no power either in England or in Singapore to call a witness suo motu without the consent of the parties < see In re Enoch And Zaretzky, Bock & Co's Arbitration < 1910 > 1 KB 327 as approved by the High Court in Alrich Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy < 1994 > 3 SLR 1 at 32 (per Chao J) >.
12 Defence counsel after obtaining a short adjournment and after conferring with his client called the father to give evidence.
13 The father's testimony insofar as material was that he was a hawker some twenty years ago; he had considerable savings left over from his days as a hawker; he kept his savings in a safe at his residence and that it was from those savings that he lent the defendant $200,000 in the course of 1990.
14 At the request of plaintiff's counsel, the plaintiff was recalled to give evidence in order to tender his bank statements to reinforce his averments. The documents thus provided showed that during the relevant period, the plaintiff had funds in his bank accounts to meet the cheque payments particularised under para 1 of the statement of claim.
Decision
15 As observed by me earlier, the main issue in this case was: Who was telling the truth and whose account was more cogent or whose version was more in conformity with probabilities?
16 In litigations of this nature, where there are contrary and contradictory assertions compounded further by the lack of independent testimony, the task to be performed by the court straddles the settlement of issues of fact or law arising on the pleadings, the determination of the constantly shifting burden and standard of proof, assessment of the demeanour of the witnesses and above all, the weight to be attached to the evidence and its evaluation thereof.
17 In evaluating the quality and cogency of the evidence presented by both contestants, one factor which did not escape and was ever in view was that the plaintiff issued four cheques amounting to $620,000 in the course of March-June 1990 and the said cheques were banked in by the defendant. Given this fact and the asseverations of the plaintiff that he was coaxed by the defendant time after time into lending him a total sum of $620,000 under the scenario described by the plaintiff, I next proceeded to consider the testimony of the defendant who appeared to lament that all the payments detailed by the plaintiff represented, in truth, the refund of loans given to the plaintiff by the defendant together with an interest element of $20,000. He appeared somewhat disconsolate in the witness box and rued that he paid out the sums in cash; worse still, he had trustingly returned the acknowledgement slips to the plaintiff when repayments were made. He could not come up with any plausible explanation as to why the plaintiff was pursuing this claim against him when he in fact did not owe him any money.
18 In my finding, that the plaintiff's claim that he kept on lending large sums after sums to a defaulting borrower, even after he had lost all faith in the latter, defied probabilities. His admitted conduct in entrusting his Rolex watch with the defendant in June 1992 for repair and making payment to the defendant such repair charges, about 19 months after the alleged debts were past due, after he had apparently lost all trust and confidence in the latter, and that too whilst he was allegedly chasing the defendant for the loan repayment cast further doubts on the plaintiff's allegations. Added to this was his lack of promptitude in waiting for nearly three years before he actually saw fit to commence the action against the defendant for the recovery of this not so insignificant sum of outstanding loan.
19 There were other peripheral features which tended to further dim the prospects of the plaintiff's case. The first one relates to his somewhat inexplicable reticence in not mentioning even once to the defendant's wife, who was known to be assisting the defendant in his business, the fact of the defendant's indebtedness of such a large sum despite his several fruitless calls at the defendant's office to demand repayment of a loan. I found this omission not only to be strange but also not to be in conformity with ordinary human behaviour of a frustrated creditor in pursuit of a slippery debtor. The second arose from the plaintiff's solicitors' demand letter dated 3 November 1993 which mentioned a sum of $600,000 and not $620,000 as being the sum claimed. Although this was explained to be an unfortunate error, another red flag was raised against the plaintiff's case. The troubling question was: How could one demand repayment of a sum of $600,000 when the loan outstanding was in fact $620,000. Why wasn't there a rectification before they were alerted to by the defendant's solicitors' letter of denial. Another negative factor sprang from the plaintiff's failure to call William Wu to support his averments.
20 Commenting on the testimony of the defendant, there was no doubt a patch of outlandishness when he testified that all the payments made by him to the plaintiff were in cash and some paid out in $10,000 bills; he did not keep such large sums in banks but in a safe kept by him and that he borrowed a sum of $200,000 in cash from his father who had retired several years ago. All the same, there was cogency in his evidence; he was consistent and struck me as a person who was relating the actual events. I must add that in this context the testimony of his father appeared to have a ring of candour and truthfulness. For a man of his age he withstood the cross-examination remarkably well, save for an occasion when he was visibly irked by a suggestion made by the plaintiff's counsel that the witness was merely complementing his son's testimony.
21 Though settled cases caution extreme circumspection in relation to placing too much emphasis on the witnesses' demeanour in court, I should add that whereas I found the defendant's deportment, inflexion and demeanour in court to be discernibly positive, I could not however say the same of the plaintiff.
22 I reviewed all the evidence adduced in this case. Whilst there was no dispute that the plaintiff had paid the defendant by way of four cheques from March 1990 to November 1990, sums totalling $620,000, my conclusion at the end was that it was more probable that these payments were repayment of loans taken by the plaintiff from the defendant and not the other way round. If it is suggested that the documentary evidence tendered by the plaintiff must be preferred over the oral explanations of the defendant, it must be remembered that the law, if any, on this subject was stated by Mansfield CJ in Aubert v Walsh And Another (1812) 4 Taunt 293 (128 ER 342), which lays down the principle that proof of the delivery and payment of a cheque by itself is not sufficient evidence of a debt (see also Egg v Barnett, Gent (1800) 3 ESP 197 (170) ER 586).
23 In my judgment, the plaintiff's claim did not appear to have the impress of truth. On the other hand, the defendant had on balance of probabilities satisfied the court that whatever cheque payments made by the plaintiff were repayments of loan extended to him by the defendant with a sum of $20,000 representing interest. In the result, I found in favour of the defendant and dismissed the plaintiff's claim with costs.

Judgment:
 
 
J U D G M E N T
1. In this action, I have to determine whether there is any basis for dissolving the marriage on the grounds alleged by the petitioner ( the wife ) in her divorce petition which was filed on 11 November 1994 and/or the grounds alleged by the respondent ( the husband ) in his cross-petition filed on 17 December 1994. The allegations made by both parties vary but essentially they are for the purposes of establishing an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage pursuant to Section 88(3)(b) of the Women's Charter, viz that one party to the marriage has behaved in such a way that the other cannot reasonably be expected to live with that party.
2. There is no dispute by both parties that the marriage between them has broken down irretrievably but it is a matter of some regret that no common ground could be established for dissolving the marriage as there was in Grenfell v Grenfell < 1978 > 1 AER 128. It would have avoided a hearing which inevitably re-opened old wounds, introducing an unnecessary invectiveness into the hearing.
3. The parties married at the Singapore Registry of Marriages on 18 July 1985. They lived, following their marriage, at various places in Singapore and eventually at Block 433 Hougang Avenue 8 #08-922, Singapore (the matrimonial home ). There are two children of the marriage, a girl whom they named Nah Shu-Lin, Teresa ( Teresa ) born on 8 April 1989 and a boy whom they named Nah Jun Bin, Vincent ( Vincent ) born on 18 February 1991.
4. The wife's grounds for her allegation that the husband has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him are :
(a) the husband is an aggressive, abusive and a very violent person. He had, on numerous occasions, abused and assaulted her on the slightest pretext.
(b) that since the marriage, the husband has failed to maintain her and that he has also failed to contribute to the welfare of the matrimonial home and to the upbringing of the children of the marriage.
(c) that the husband always quarrelled with the wife over money and that instead of maintaining her and contributing to the welfare of the matrimonial home and to the upbringing of the children, he demanded money from her.
(d) that in June 1993, the husband threw out her clothing and locked her out of the matrimonial home, that on his letting her into the matrimonial home after the police were called, he switched off the electricity in the house and threatened to beat her if she switched this on, which then caused her to leave the matrimonial home.
5. The wife's evidence is that the early years of the marriage were uneventful except for occasional squabbles over money. In 1988, these quarrels became more frequent as the husband asked for money from the wife. She was then earning about S$550.00 a month as a clerk and the husband was earning about S$400.00 plus a month as a driver. She said she used to do the marketing using the money she earned. She accepted the husband occasionally paid the marketing expenses although she said this was few and far between and that even then, he never gave her any maintenance. She also alleged he spent a lot of money on 4-digit lotteries and that he also bet on horses. She did not specify how much. On 31 December 1988, the parties bought the matrimonial home for a sum of S$71,000.00 ( the purchase price ).
A sum of S$10,000.00 was deducted from his CPF account and S$5,000.00 from the wife's CPF account in part payment of the purchase price and from that date, each month, a sum of S$100.00 was deducted from the wife's CPF account and a sum of S$120.00 from the husband's CPF account in payment of the loan the parties jointly borrowed to pay for the purchase of the matrimonial home.
6. In April 1989, Teresa was born. After Teresa's birth, the wife returned to work. She said she had to, to maintain herself and Teresa. She was paid about S$700.00 a month. She said she also looked after Teresa, all her needs and continued to pay for the marketing with the monies she earned. Her mother helped look after Teresa during the day when the wife was working and for this assistance, the wife paid her mother S$200.00 a month.
7. The wife continued to work until about December 1991. She was then expecting Vincent. The wife's evidence is that she did not work again until about May 1992. She said she again had to as the husband did not give her any maintenance. She worked the night shift and she said she had to look after the two children during the day because by this time the wife's mother could no longer look after Teresa.
She worked the night shift at a company known as Digital Equipment Pte Ltd ( Digital ) and stayed with Digital until about July 1993. At Digital she was paid about S$850.00 a month. Her working the night shift according to her led to quarrels with the husband over the children's maintenance and their care and control. It was during these quarrels she said that the husband would fly into a rage kick her in the stomach, spit on her and abuse her with foul language.
8. Matters then, according to the wife, came to a head in mid 1993. She had come home one morning having completed her night shift at Digital only to find she had been locked out of the matrimonial home by the husband. The husband had refused to allow her in despite her pleas. It took a visit from the police before the husband relented. At or about the same time also, that is sometime in July 1993, the wife further alleged the husband in the course of a quarrel that arose out of her refusal to take either or both of the children with her to a company staff lunch, hit her hard on her head. She again had to call the police for the husband to relent. On her return home that evening, she said the husband had thrown all her clothing out of the matrimonial home.
She found these strewn all over the corridor. She was again locked out. Again she said she had to call the police to intervene. That same evening, after she had gained entry, she said in cross-examination, the husband switched off the lights in the bathroom when she was in it and threatened to beat her up if she switched these on again. She then said, shortly thereafter she left the matrimonial home as she could no longer tolerate the husband's beatings and abuse.
9. All these allegations are denied by the husband. It is his case, as set out in paragraph 11 of his cross-petition (which the wife denied in her reply and answer to cross-petition) that it was in reality the wife's behaviour which caused the marriage's irretrievable breakdown. In brief, the husband alleged the wife's behaviour as :
(a) the wife's improper association with another man;
(b) the wife's treating the husband with little affection and display of little interest in the children; and
(c) the wife's failure to contribute towards the maintenance of the family.
10. The evidence of the wife and husband in support of the petition and the cross-petition is inevitably intertwined. I shall deal first with the wife's case to see, on the totality of the evidence and on a balance of probabilities, whether the wife has proven any of the allegations set out in her petition.
11. Much was said by both the wife and the husband and their account of events differ substantially. But it is common ground that both did not earn large sums of money even by 1993 and that there were quarrels between them. The quarrels appeared to have escalated in frequency and by 1993, in intensity. They arose out of domestic issues, whichever view one takes of these because they related to which parent ought to be taking care of the children, money matters and the wife's social and work habits in 1993. The fact of the quarrels however does not in itself constitute behaviour of the husband allowing the wife to obtain a dissolution of the marriage.
12. Having had the benefit of observing both the wife and the husband as they related their version of events, I must say that I was not altogether satisfied with the wife's narration of events. It is clear that notwithstanding the quarrels which started as early as 1988, the wife continued to live in the matrimonial home with the husband and I take this into account in considering the wife's evidence of the events alleged to have taken place from 1988 to about end 1992 as I am entitled to do under Section 88(6) of the Women's Charter.
13. In any event the wife was unable to provide specific evidence of incidents of the husband's aggression, abusiveness and violence during the period 1988 to mid 1993. Where she was able to particularise these and that was in her account of the husband's behaviour in 1993 (as to which see paragraph 8 above), I did not find her evidence satisfactory.
No police or medical reports were produced, no independant witness was called and in cross-examination, her evidence was found wanting. She could not for instance on the company lunch incident remember the date of the alleged company lunch, acknowledged that despite the husband's aggression when she insisted on going to the lunch without the children, that she was still able to call the police on the telephone, and she claimed that notwithstanding the pain in her head caused by the husband's hitting her on the head, that she was still able to attend the company function returning home some hours later that day at 7 p.m.
14. I have not overlooked the incident where the husband threw water at the wife to wake her up. This was admitted by the husband. But this was only one incident and has to be put in the context of the evidence and the husband's evidence (which I accept) that this arose as a result of the wife's refusal to help him clean the children. This one incident alone does not, in my view, constitute evidence of the husband's aggression.
15. I was also not impressed by the evidence adduced by the wife of the husband's failure to maintain her, to contribute to the welfare of the matrimonial home and to the upbringing of the children. The undisputed evidence relating to the acquisition of the matrimonial home and of each party's contribution to that purchase shows the husband did contribute to its acquisition and in a larger amount. It cannot also be disputed that he shared the task of looking after the children. Who else looked after the children in the evenings when the wife was on her night shift ? The wife furthermore conceded that
it was the respondent who had to wake Teresa up, prepare her and bring her to her (ie. the wife's) mother's place in Serangoon each morning (at pages 29 and 56 of the Notes of Evidence),that
she and the respondent took turns to bring Teresa home during her time at Junior Playworld (at page 33 of the Notes of Evidence)and that it was the husband who sent
Teresa to St. Francis Seminary and that at the end of the day, either the respondent or I would pick her up (at page 36 of the Notes of Evidence).
She further conceded that Teresa's babysitting fees of S$200.00 to S$250.00 each month (at page 47 of the Notes of Evidence) were paid by the husband and she also accepted that the husband had in fact given her a supplementary Citibank Visa card for her use.
16. In these circumstances, having observed the wife as she gave her evidence, I considered on a totality of the evidence, the wife's evidence to be unreliable. I accept the husband's submissions that the wife has failed to prove any of her allegations and I dismiss the petition.
17. I turn now to the husband's cross-petition. I accept the husband's allegations that the wife has behaved in such a way that the husband cannot reasonably be expected to live with the wife. I do so for the following reasons.
18. First, the existence of two handwritten notes written by the wife, which she admitted was written by her, to a man known as Johnson (which were admitted and marked as RB50-51 ) corroborate the husband's allegation that from about February 1993, the wife had been improperly associating with a man who was also working in Digital known as Johnson .
The wife attempted to explain the association away initially by claiming Johnson was just an ex-colleague, which she on further cross-examination conceded was a good friend and colleague and when pressed said that she considered their relationship akin to that of a sister and younger brother. She attempted to explain away what she had written by claiming she had a poor command of English. But I find it difficult to accept all of these explanations in view of the wife's express declaration of love (in the Chinese language) for Johnson and requests for a hug again and kiss me again and her declaration (to Johnson) miss you very much in these notes.
They suggest a far more intimate relationship than the wife was prepared to admit. It may have been no coincidence that the quarrels between the wife and the husband increased in frequency and intensity in 1992 and 1993 when both the wife and Johnson were working at Digital.
19. Second, the husband was not challenged in cross-examination when he could have been, on the husband's assertion that the wife had once said to him that she had little affection for him .
20. Third, the wife has also conceded that she did not bring the family for meals and social outings to the Zoo/Bird Park except for a few shopping trips with Teresa. In cross- examination the wife was also shown to have little knowledge of her children's nursery and child-care arrangements. For example, she could not recall the time period pertaining to Teresa's nursery/babysitting arrangements, she could not remember how many months she had taken care of Vincent nor could she remember when Vincent was placed with a babysitter save to say that he was quite big when he was sent to the babysitter (at pages 45 and 77 of the Notes of Evidence).
21. Accordingly, I grant a dissolution of the marriage based on the husband's cross-petition and grant a decree nisi on the cross-petition to be made absolute in three months. The husband's costs of the petition and the cross-petition are to be paid by the wife.
22. I make no finding on the ancillary issues which are adjourned to Chambers for determination.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
The background 1. The principal players involved in this suit may be briefly described in the following manner. The first plaintiff is a company organised and existing under the laws of Indonesia. The President Director and beneficial owner of all the shares in the first plaintiff is one Johanis Se Nga ('Se Nga'). The second plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore carrying on the business of a housing and commercial developer. The managing director of the second plaintiff is one Ang Yee Lim ('AYL'), also referred to as Lawrence Ang in the affidavits. The defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guthrie GTS Limited, a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
2. Sometime in 1988, PT Jaya Putra Kundur ('JPK'), an Indonesian company wholly-owned by Se Nga, acquired a piece of land, comprising approximately 90 hectares, situated at Kampong Patam on the island of Batam, Indonesia. Se Nga approached the second plaintiff in 1989 to discuss the possibility of a joint venture using the land. Based on market sentiment prevailing at that time, Se Nga and AYL decided to develop that piece of land in Batam into a holiday resort. They then started to look for another partner to invest in and jointly develop this project. When these plans became known in the market, Guthrie GTS Limited showed a keen interest in investing in and participating in the development. Two directors of Guthrie GTS Limited, Ben Yeo ('BY') and James Lim ('JL') met up with AYL and heard his proposals on the project. Subsequently, BY and JL were introduced to Se Nga. Discussions between the parties followed and agreement was reached.
3. By a joint venture agreement dated 4 May 1990 made in Singapore between the defendant, the first plaintiff and the second plaintiff ('the 1st JVA'), the parties entered into a joint venture to develop on the land in Batam a holiday resort known as the Indah Puri Resort. This resort was to consist of:
a) a hotel; 
b) a golf club;
c) a condominium complex;
d) a marina; 
e) holiday chalets; and
f) a jetty with immigration and customs clearance facilities.
As at the time I heard this application, only the golf course and the condominium complex had been completed. The main reasons why the rest of the resort project had not been completed were because of disagreements between the plaintiffs and the defendant on, amongst other things, the size, concept, aesthetics of the various parts of the project, the lack of funds and the plaintiffs' refusal to assist in the financial difficulties faced by the joint venture vehicle.
4. Pursuant to the 1st JVA, the joint venture vehicle through which the resort was to be developed was to be a joint venture company called PT Guthrie Jaya Indah Island Resort ('PTG'). All three parties were to be the shareholders of PTG. The initial shareholding of PTG was set out in Section 2 of the 1st JVA which provided that the defendant would hold 51% of the shares in PTG while the plaintiffs would each hold 24.5% of the shares. The 1st JVA also provided that the defendant could appoint up to five directors to sit on the board of PTG while the plaintiffs could appoint up to two directors each. Under the terms of the 1st JVA, Se Nga and AYL were deemed to be directors of PTG as representatives of the first and second plaintiffs respectively.
BY, JL and one Low Hua Kin were deemed to be the directors of PTG as representatives of the defendant. It was also agreed that JPK was to transfer its interest in the land in Batam to PTG. However, it was not in dispute that, as at the time I heard this application, the process of incorporation for PTG had not been completed. PTG hence remained unincorporated under Indonesian law.
5. Section 6 of the 1st JVA provided that the defendant would undertake to provide all technical, management and marketing services to PTG for the project, in return for which the defendant would be paid management fees by PTG. Section 12 contained detailed provisions as to the quorum and voting requirements of directors' and company meetings with respect to resolutions concerning certain specified matters, such as the sale of golf club memberships, execution of agreements for the construction of any part of the project, termination of the management agreement relating to the project, alterations to the capital structure of PTG, selection of corporate officers and changes to the overall financial policy of PTG. Section 14 provided that the defendant bore the general responsibility for procuring the financing for the project.
6. Guthrie Batam Resort Marketing Services Pte Ltd ('GBRMS') was incorporated in Singapore to manage and carry out the marketing of the project in Singapore. The shareholding of GBRMS was in the same proportions as that of PTG. GBRMS started marketing the resort sometime in September 1990.
7. Although it was agreed in the 1st JVA that the defendant would take charge of the management of the project, no formal management agreement was drawn up. It was not disputed, however, that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guthrie GTS Ltd, called Guthrie PMS (S) Pte Ltd ('GPMS'), undertook the duties of project manager and were paid management fees for their services. GPMS's duties included calling for tenders for the construction of the resort, recommending suitable contractors and administering the award of the projects' contracts to the best tender in terms of costs and quality.
8. Initially, things went smoothly. In September 1990, the first sale of the golf memberships was launched. As of May 1996, approximately 1,500 golf memberships had been sold. The early preliminary works on the resort commenced sometime in late 1990. Actual construction started in or around mid-1991. GPMS proceeded to award contracts for building the golf course, the golf club house and the social facilities. In 1991, the parties set up a company, PT Guthrie Jayakundur Construction, to undertake the construction of the condominium complex. By October 1991, GPMS was in the process of finalising the design layout of the marina. In January 1992, the sale of marina memberships was launched. About 180 memberships were sold at $180,000 per membership.
9. Tenders for the construction of the marina were invited in March 1992. In July 1992, a letter of intent was offered to PT Ballast Indonesia Construction, but for reasons that were unclear, the contract was never signed. In September 1993, a contract was awarded to Hai Sheng Construction Pte Ltd, but the marina it built sank within a few months of its completion. In May 1994, PT Marina City submitted a proposed offer to build the marina, but nothing came out of this. In September 1994, Easteel Construction Services Pte Ltd was awarded the contract; however, it had to withdraw because certain technical assumptions based on which it had taken on the contract were found to be inaccurate.
In May 1995, a letter of intent was awarded to Yean Tong Construction Pte Ltd, but this soon fell through because the necessary corporate guarantee from Guthrie GTS Ltd could not be obtained.
10. In 1993, Batam became less popular as an investment opportunity and a holiday destination. Sales of golf memberships, marina memberships, condominium units as well as public interest in the project generally declined. The decreased revenue affected the Company's cash flow and financial ability to complete the project. To alleviate the financial problems, the defendant injected funds into the project by buying some of the unsold condominium units for itself. In accordance with its obligations under the 1st JVA, the defendant also secured bank loans for the Company approximating $3.5m. In 1995, the defendant took up the majority of the unsold condominium units.
But PTG's financial problems still persisted -- it could not pay its suppliers and the staff salaries. There were also problems with staff performance and morale. To make matters worse, in late 1994, the apartment owners began to complain that the facilities that had been promised, such as the marina, had not been completed. Many marina membership owners threatened to withdraw their memberships.
11. The working relationship between the parties deteriorated as a result of all these problems. The plaintiffs blamed the defendant for failing to keep to its end of the bargain by providing adequate financing for the project with the result that both the plaintiffs had to procure and provide personal guarantees for overdraft facilities granted to PTG. In this respect, the main disagreement between the parties was as to who was responsible for the provision of finance necessary for the building of the various parts of the resort, particularly the marina. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant had failed to live up to its obligation under the 1st JVA in that GPMS had not performed its function as the project manager satisfactorily.
12. The defendant, on the other hand, blamed the plaintiffs for being uncooperative, difficult and indecisive when it came to making decisions regarding the various parts of the project. This was particularly so when it came to the construction of the marina. AYL and Se Nga unrealistically expected the construction of the marina to be financed primarily by the sale of the marina memberships, and when the launch of the marina memberships did not live up to expectations, they lost interest in the viability of constructing the marina. As a result, AYL and Se Nga were reluctant to inject any capital to finance the marina's construction. They would repeatedly make excuses to avoid committing themselves to awarding the contract for building the marina to any contractor. The lack of commitment on the part of the plaintiffs paralysed the resort project in respect of the marina.
13. In reply to the plaintiffs' contention that it was the defendant who bore the financial burden of injecting more capital into the project, the defendant insisted that its responsibility under the 1st JVA was only to procure financing for the project and not to directly finance its construction without the co- operation of all parties. The defendant tried on numerous occasions to obtain financing in order to rescue PTG from financial crisis but these attempts came to nought because Se Nga had failed to take the necessary steps to properly incorporate PTG, a responsibility that he had volunteered to undertake.
14. The defendant also alleged that the plaintiffs would often withhold their authorisation for the payment of salaries and fees owed to contractors, suppliers and employees of PTG. The plaintiffs also unreasonably refused to accede to engaging professional resort managers to run the resort. They reneged on an agreement with the defendant to take up some condominium units in order to temporarily alleviate the cash flow problem experienced by PTG.
15. Matters came to a head at an extraordinary general meeting held in Singapore on 30 August 1995. At this meeting, Se Nga and AYL were asked to execute certain documents that purportedly had the effect of declaring the 1st JVA null and void, increasing PTG's share capital and replacing BY and JL as two of the directors of PTG with three others; Se Nga and AYL refused.
16. On 10 January 1996, a shareholders' meeting of PTG was held in Batam where resolutions were passed appointing new directors and increasing the share capital of PTG. This was purportedly in breach of the voting requirements as well as the provision in the 1st JVA that stipulated how many directors each party to the JVA was entitled to appoint to be on the board of directors. Se Nga and AYL were not present at this meeting.
17. On 31 January 1996, a directors' meeting was held in Batam where Se Nga and AYL were not present. At this meeting, several resolutions were passed including those opening bank accounts in Singapore and Batam, approving the budget and approving the plan for the construction of the marina. On 2 February 1996, the total sum of $197,380.00 was transferred from PTG's three bank accounts with ABN AMRO Bank Singapore Branch to a bank account known as 'BCA, JKT FVG PT Guthrie Jaya Indah Island Resort'. The plaintiffs' contention was that neither the transfer of the money nor the opening of this 'BCA JKT' account was with the authorisation of the plaintiffs or their representatives, and was thus in breach of the provisions of the 1st JVA. To compound matters, receipts for PTG including green fees, maintenance fees, food and beverage revenue, apartment rentals and membership subscriptions and instalment payments had not been paid into PTG's designated bank account for such receipts, which had been approved and opened in accordance with the 1st JVA.
18. On 1 March 1996, the plaintiffs commenced this suit against the defendant seeking, inter alia, damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, of a mandatory and restrictive nature, in respect of a wide variety of matters. The plaintiffs' claims against the defendant can be summarised as follows:
(1) In breach of the provisions of the 1st JVA and/or PTG's Deed of Establishment,
(a) on 9 January 1996, at the shareholders' meeting of PTG held at Batam, the defendant's appointees caused to be passed certain shareholders' resolutions to appoint a board of directors and to increase the authorised share capital of PTG;
(b) on 31 January 1996, at the directors' meeting of PTG held at Batam, the defendant's appointees caused to be passed certain board resolutions to open bank accounts for PTG, to approve the budget, to approve the plan of the marina project and to appoint a new resort manager and a corporate lawyer;
(c) on or about 2 February 1996, the defendant's appointees transferred the total sum of $197,380.00 from PTG's bank accounts at ABN AMRO Bank Singapore Branch to another account under the name of BCA, JKT FVG PT Guthrie Jaya Indah Island Resort. Neither of the plaintiffs authorised this transfer or the opening of the account to which the monies were transferred.
(2) In breach of the provisions of the 1st JVA, (a) the defendant failed to provide all technical and management services for the joint venture project as well as marketing services for the project, the sale memberships in the golf club, the marina and the social club and the sale of the condominium units and/or failed to provide such services adequately or properly;
(b) the defendant failed to procure all such loans and advances as required by PTG to complete the joint venture project;
(c) the defendant failed to proceed with the construction and development of the marina diligently and expeditiously and to complete the holiday chalets and resort hotel within the agreed time frame of 4 years;
(d) the defendant failed to use its best endeavours to procure and ensure that the holiday resort would be a commercial success.
19. By way of a Notice of Motion entered as No 49 of 1996 filed on the same day, the plaintiffs applied for interlocutory relief in respect of the restrictive and mandatory injunctions prayed for in their Statement of Claim.
20. By way of Summons-in-Chambers No 1905 of 1996 filed on 22 March, the defendant applied for a stay of all proceedings in the action. The grounds of the application were that the court in Singapore was not the appropriate forum for the trial of the action and that the action would more suitably be heard in the Indonesian courts or, alternatively, that the parties ought to enter into arbitration in Indonesia.
21. The defendant's position in reply to the allegations raised by the plaintiffs in the statement of claim was set out in the first affidavit of Low Check Kwang, a director of the defendant, filed on behalf of the defendant in support of the stay application. It appeared that subsequent to the signing of the 1st JVA on 4 May 1990, the parties concerned had executed two other agreements on 15 August 1990. One was a 2nd JVA in the form common for an Indonesian Approved Foreign Investment Company. The plaintiffs did not deny the existence or authenticity of these two documents. It was clear that the 2nd JVA was executed for the purpose of submission to the relevant Indonesian authorities for approval in respect of the proposed foreign investment project and for the incorporation of PTG. Its terms were materially different from those of the 1st JVA. The second was an agreement intended to be supplemental to the 1st and 2nd JVAs. The purpose of this supplemental agreement was to provide that in the event of inconsistency between the 1st JVA and the 2nd JVA, the parties would abide by and observe the terms of the 1st JVA.
22. Since the project in Batam concerned the incorporation of an Indonesian company with foreign shareholders, it was necessary under Indonesian law for investment applications to be processed through the Batam Industrial Development Authority ('the Batam Authority') as well as the Investment Coordinating Board of Indonesia ('BKPM'). In addition, Presidential approval must also be obtained for the joint venture. In the application for approval sent to the relevant authorities, it was the 2nd JVA that was submitted for approval instead of the 1st JVA.
Approvals of the President and the other relevant authorities were obtained in December 1990. In these circumstances, the defendant adopted the position that, under Indonesian law, the 2nd JVA was the only agreement that would be recognised by the Indonesian Courts as the valid and binding agreement between the parties. It was unlikely that the Indonesian Courts would recognise the 1st JVA and the supplemental agreement since these two agreements had not been submitted to the authorities for approval.
23. The defendant also pointed out, and this was not disputed by the plaintiffs, that PTG had yet to be incorporated under Indonesian law because its Deed of Establishment had not received the approval of the Indonesian Ministry of Justice. As a result of this, the plaintiffs' allegations that the defendant had acted in breach of the PTG's Deed of Establishment were misconceived. The defendant further alleged that the delay in the incorporation of PTG was due to the failure of Se Nga to act expeditiously in obtaining the approval of its Deed of Establishment from the Ministry of Justice.
24. The parties agreed to have the Notice of Motion seeking an interlocutory injunction heard together with the Summons-in- Chambers seeking a stay of all proceedings. The two applications were fixed before me on 16 and 17 May 1996. I naturally heard arguments on the stay application first. After hearing arguments by both counsel, I granted the defendant's application for a stay of all further proceedings in the action. The plaintiffs have now appealed against my decision (Civil Appeal No 92 of 1996).
The law 25. It is settled law in England and in Singapore that the basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of forum non conveniens where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for trial of the action, i.e., in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice - per Lord Goff at p 476 in Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd < 1987 > 1 AC 460, first accepted as part of the law in Singapore by the High Court in J H Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd v Teck Hock & Co (Pte) Ltd < 1990 > 2 MLJ 142 (a case concerning service outside jurisdiction under Order 11 of the Rules of the Supreme Court) and by the Court of Appeal in Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp v PT Airfast Services Indonesia < 1992 > 2 SLR 776. The principle in Spiliada was recently reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern < 1995 > 3 SLR 97.
26. How is this basic principle applied? Generally, in the case when the plaintiffs have commenced an action by service of process in Singapore and the court's jurisdiction is hence founded as of right, the legal burden rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a stay. It is for the defendant to show not only that Singapore is not the appropriate or natural forum, but that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than the Singapore forum.
27. In ascertaining whether there is a clearly more appropriate forum abroad, the search is for the country with which the action has the most real and substantial connection. The court will look at all the relevant connecting factors, and these will include not only factors affecting convenience or expense, such as the availability of witnesses, but other factors such as the law governing the relevant transaction and the place where the parties reside or carry on business.
28. In cases, where the court finds that there is no clearly more appropriate forum, i.e., where either there is no country which is the natural forum or Singapore is the natural forum, it will ordinarily refuse a stay of proceedings.
29. If, however, the court finds that there is some other available forum which is clearly and distinctly more appropriate for the trial of the action, it will ordinarily grant a stay of the proceedings unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that there are reasons of justice that would urge the court not to grant a stay of proceedings but rather to hear the case in Singapore. At this stage, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including circumstances that go beyond those taken into account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions. In this context, the fact that the plaintiff will obtain a legitimate personal or juridical advantage from suing in Singapore is not decisive but is merely a factor to be taken into consideration.
30. In De Dampierre v De Dampierre < 1988 > 1 AC 92, the House of Lords held that the principles enunciated in Spiliada in relation to the grant of a stay of proceedings on the doctrine of forum non conveniens are equally applicable when there was a lis alibi pendens, i.e., where litigation involving the same parties and the same issues is continuing simultaneously in two different countries. In other words, the fact that a refusal of a stay of proceedings will lead to a multiplicity of proceedings in Singapore and abroad is a relevant and important factor to be considered under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.
31. I realised, however, that the question has not been fully addressed by the authorities as to at what stage of the enquiry does the court take into account the fact that there is a lis alibi pendens -- whether it is at the stage of deciding whether there is a clearly appropriate forum abroad or whether it is at the stage of deciding whether there are reasons of justice upon which a stay of proceedings should be refused. Nevertheless, without the benefit of detailed argument, I am tentatively willing to take the view that, conceptually, the factor of lis alibi pendens may be considered at both stages of the enquiry.
32. The first policy reason why it is undesirable to have concurrent actions in Singapore and abroad is because it involves more expense and inconvenience to the parties than if trial was held in merely one country (The Abidin Daver < 1984 > 1 AC 398 at pp 411-2). Hence, the factor of lis alibi pendens may be considered at the stage of determining whether there is a clearly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action together with the other factors considered at this stage which also seek to avoid unnecessary expense and inconvenience such as the location of the evidence, the residence of the parties, the choice of law, etc.
33. The other main reason why a lis alibi pendens should be avoided is that it can lead to two conflicting judgments, with an unseemly race by the parties to be first to obtain judgment and to subsequent problems of estoppel; this is a recipe for confusion and injustice (see The Abidin Daver (supra) at pp 412, 423-4). As such, in my view, a lis alibi pendens may also be taken into account as a factor in the second stage of the enquiry when determining whether there are reasons of justice why the trial should or should not take place in Singapore. It is at this stage that concerns similar to lis alibi pendens, such as those factors which demonstrate why it may lead to injustice to have trial in a forum abroad, eg. excessive delay in the foreign forum, will be deliberated upon by the court.
The decision 34. I first considered whether the defendant had shown that there was clearly a more appropriate forum abroad which would be more suitable for the trial of the action. The thrust of the defendant's argument was that Indonesia was the forum with which the action had the most real and substantial connection.
35. Counsel for the defendant first argued that, irrespective of whichever forum would try the action, there was an essential preliminary issue that had to be decided - whether it was the 1st or the 2nd JVA that was the operative agreement between the parties. It was not disputed by the plaintiffs that the 2nd JVA was executed by them.
36. For a foreign direct investment company, such as PTG, to be incorporated in Indonesia for the purpose of carrying out foreign investment, one of the required procedures under Indonesian law is for the parties to apply for investment approval through the Batam Authority to BKPM, otherwise known as the Investment Coordinating Board. BKPM is a government agency directly responsible to the President of the Republic of Indonesia. The functions of BKPM include assisting the President in formulating government policies with regard to investment, processing investment approvals and licenses, and conducting supervision of the investment implementation. To obtain the approval of BKPM, several documents have to be submitted to them including the joint venture agreement between the parties. The application and its supporting documents will be evaluated by BKPM. If all goes well, BKPM will send the appropriate recommendation to the President for his approval. Upon the President's approval, BKPM will issue to the investors a Notification of Presidential Approval.
37. In this case, the defendant alleged that the agreement that was submitted to the Batam Authority and BKPM was the 2nd JVA and not the 1st. It was on the basis of the 2nd JVA that the Batam Authority's approval, BKPM's recommendation and the Presidential approval were obtained. The defendant's Indonesian lawyers rendered their legal opinion that, under Indonesian law, it appeared that the 2nd JVA was the only agreement that would be recognised by the Indonesian courts to be valid and binding between the plaintiffs and the defendant. It was unlikely that the Indonesian courts will recognise the validity of the 1st JVA as to do so would be contrary to Indonesian public policy. Thus, there was an issue as to which agreement would prevail as between the parties. This issue of which agreement will be recognised to be the operative agreement between the parties was to be determined in accordance with Indonesian law and Indonesian public policy. Counsel for the defendant argued that this is something that would be more appropriately determined by an Indonesian court.
38. As for the claims made by the plaintiffs with respect to the breaches of the 1st JVA, counsel for the defendant pointed out that they raise issues of Indonesian law relating to,
(i) the rules and regulations governing investment in Indonesia by foreign shareholders;
(ii) the incorporation of companies in Indonesia; 
(iii) the substantive rights and obligations of shareholders of an Indonesian company prior to incorporation and the law governing their relationship;
(iv) the procedural requirements under Indonesian law as to how meetings of 'shareholders' of an Indonesian company which had yet to be incorporated were to be held.
Counsel for the defendant pointed out that Indonesian law on these issues would have to be proved as a matter of fact if litigated in Singapore. But if the action was tried in Indonesia, the courts there could deal with the issues straight- away, thus saving time and costs.
39. In reply, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that the submission of an agreement to the authorities for approval is a matter that relates to procedure or formality and not substance. Counsel cited me authority, which I find it unnecessary to repeat here, that a contract will be regarded as being formally valid if it satisfies either the requirements of the place in which it was made or its proper law. In this case, the 1st JVA was executed by the parties in Singapore. Under Singapore law, the 1st JVA was formally valid and Indonesian law as to formalities was thus irrelevant. Hence, there was really no issue as to which agreement was the one that would be recognised as the one governing the relationship between the parties. It was clear that it was the 1st JVA that was relevant. Alternatively, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that even if the issue before the court concerned one of Indonesian public policy, courts in Singapore are competent to decide on questions of foreign public policy based on affidavit evidence on foreign law.
40. As regards Indonesian law governing the claims arising out of the alleged breaches of the 1st JVA, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out that the defendant had not adduced any evidence to show that there was any distinction between the Indonesian and Singapore law of contract. Hence, I was entitled to assume that Indonesian law in this particular respect was the same as Singapore law and that there was no advantage to have the matter heard before an Indonesian court.
41. I was unable to accept counsel for the plaintiffs' arguments. In the first place, putting aside any question of which JVA would prevail, the plaintiffs' claims against the defendant were grounded almost entirely on breaches of the 1st JVA. There was no dispute that the proper law of the 1st JVA is Indonesian law. In fact, there was an express choice of law clause (Section 24) in the 1st JVA choosing Indonesian law as the proper law of the agreement. Hence, the trial of the action with respect to the breaches of the 1st JVA would be governed by Indonesian law.
42. Secondly, and more importantly, I accepted that there was, in fact, a preliminary question of which would be the prevailing agreement to be decided by the court which tries the action. I also accepted that it was a question of Indonesian law and Indonesian public policy whether or not the court would accept that the 1st JVA would be the contract which governed the relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant, bearing in mind the important fact that it was with reference to the 2nd JVA that the Indonesian authorities actually granted their approval for the building of the holiday resort in Batam. It was artificial for counsel for the plaintiffs to characterise the issue of the non-submission of the 1st JVA to the relevant Indonesian authorities as a question of formalities of the agreement that could be determined by the law of Singapore.
Rather, the issue was one of whether the 1st JVA was effective and valid as between the parties when it had not been approved by BKPM and the President of Indonesia. The validity of this agreement must be determined in accordance with its proper law -- Indonesian law. Since the issue also involved the question of whether an investment agreement not submitted to the Indonesian authorities for approval would nevertheless be recognised under Indonesian law, this also attracted the application of Indonesian public policy. Questions of Indonesian public policy are best determined by Indonesian courts rather than the courts in Singapore. As authority, I could do no better than to refer to the recent decision of Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern (supra) where the Court of Appeal ordered a stay of proceedings in Singapore on the ground of forum non conveniens. Thean JA, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said (at pp 106-7):
The respondent has in his defence, stated that should the appellant's claim in respect of the EHSB and SHC (Malaya) shares be true, the appellant would have committed a breach of Malaysian company law and also a breach of the listing requirements of The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) ... Both these breaches involve a question of public policy in Malaysia. If the appellant's claim is true, then he would have committed some offences or breaches of the listing requirements and the Malaysian courts would have to decide as a matter of public policy whether to enforce the appellant's claim.
An issue of Malaysian public policy is best left to be determined by the Malaysian court.
43. Thirdly, I also rejected the plaintiffs' argument that I should assume that Indonesian law was no different from Singapore law when the defendant has adduced no evidence to show that Indonesian law was materially different and that, hence, there would be no advantage in an Indonesian court hearing the case. In The Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd < 1995 > 1 SLR 773 Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) said (at p 778):
As regards the claim governed by Indian law, there was no evidence before me that the Indian law as to the sale of goods and the obligations of the seller to deliver goods meeting the contractual specifications was any different from Singapore law on the subject. In this connection, the following words of Lai Kew Chai J in The Eastern Trust at p 535 were apposite:
It is clearly advantageous for questions of foreign law to be decided by the courts of that country, and this advantage has been recognized and given due weight in numerous cases.
However, the importance of this factor will depend to a large extent on the difference between the applicable law and Singapore law. There will be no real prejudice to either party if the law of the foreign court does not differ significantly from the relevant law of Singapore.
With respect, I agree with that observation. It appeared to me that in this case the governing law issue was a neutral one. On the one hand, Singapore law governed a substantial portion of the case. On the other hand, since no significant difference had been shown by the defendants to exist between Indian law and Singapore law on the sale of goods, no real advantage would be gained by the defendants in having the action heard in India simply because the Indian sale of goods law had to be applied.
While I accepted that this passage represents the true legal position, the facts of this case were such that an issue attracting the application of Indonesian public policy, not just Indonesian law, would be presented to the court for decision. The defendant had, in fact, adduced some evidence, via a legal opinion exhibited in Low Check Kwang's first affidavit, that the fact of the 1st JVA not having been submitted to the authorities for approval might very well lead to its non-recognition as a valid agreement under Indonesian law and public policy. As I have sought to explain earlier, such an issue would be better determined by an Indonesian court. It would be impossible to assume that Indonesian public policy and Singapore public policy were identical in this regard.
44. Additionally, I would also say that the issues thrown up for dispute by the plaintiffs' claims go further than simply encompassing the Indonesian law of contract. The weight to be attributed to this factor of the law governing the action, which is essentially a question of evidential efficiency in proving foreign law, depends greatly on whether complex issues of law are involved as opposed to straightforward legal issues or matters of construction. I accepted that, in this case, counsel for the defendant had demonstrated that there were numerous difficult questions of Indonesian law and public policy involved in resolving the dispute between the parties. As pointed out by counsel for the defendant, the spectrum of Indonesian law raised by the issues would cover contract law, company law, partnership law, the procedural rules and regulations governing foreign investment, the specific legal rules governing the relationship between shareholders of yet-to-be-incorporated foreign investment companies and the relevant law governing the conduct of meetings. Although the defendant did not adduce any evidence to show specifically the difference between Singapore and Indonesian law in these various areas, it would have been impetuous and intractable for me to insist that unless there was clear evidence before me of the material differences between the two systems of law, I would refuse to recognise that the Indonesian court would clearly be at an advantage, as compared to a Singapore court, in more effectively dealing with the issues of Indonesian law that would arise in the course of the trial of the action. To do so would be to shut my eyes to the obvious.
45. Counsel for the defendant next argued that the preponderance of the evidence on this issue of whether it was the 1st JVA that was valid and binding is located in Indonesia rather than Singapore -- evidence needed to be given of the nature of the documents that were submitted to the Batam Authority, BKPM and the Indonesian Ministry of Justice for approval and the respective views of these authorities on the validity of the documents submitted. As such, witnesses from these Indonesian authorities would have to be called. The documentary evidence in this regard would naturally be located in Indonesia.
46. Counsel for the plaintiffs did not make a substantive reply to this argument because she maintained the view that there was really no issue of the 1st JVA being not recognised under Indonesian law as the binding agreement between the parties. As for the plaintiffs' claims relating to the breaches of the 1st JVA, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that there were many witnesses as well as extensive documentary evidence located in Singapore. One of the claims concerned the defendant's alleged failure to build the marina. In order for this claim to be resolved, recourse must be had to the many Singapore contractors' tenders to undertake the construction of the marina, that were rejected. The witnesses and the documentary evidence in this respect were located in Singapore. Also, to determine whether the defendant was liable for the acts and defaults of GPMS, the activities carried out by GPMS concerning the project must be scrutinised. All meetings of GPMS were held in Singapore and all agreements entered into by GPMS were executed in Singapore. The evidence in this regard would be found in Singapore. Counsel for the plaintiffs also argued that the cost, delay and inconvenience involved in translating all the documentary evidence in Singapore to Bahasa Indonesia if the trial of the action took place in Indonesia should urge me that Singapore was a more natural forum for the trial of the action.
47. I did not accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs. Rather, I was persuaded by her opponent's arguments that substantively almost all of the evidence relating to the question of what documents were actually submitted to the various Indonesian authorities for approval would be located in Indonesia. I took the view that the evidence in this respect was absolutely crucial because they would resolve the preliminary issue of which JVA would be the one that would be recognised under Indonesian law. As mentioned, against this argument, counsel for the plaintiffs did not, and I think could not, give any real reply.
48. However I was also not entirely unmoved by the arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs that the witnesses and the documentary evidence with respect to many of the issues raised by the plaintiffs' claims were to be found in Singapore. I would make the comment, however, with respect to both the plaintiffs' and the defendant's contentions in this regard, that the location of witnesses and documentary evidence in any particular country with the consequent need to transport witnesses and translate documents is an almost unavoidable and inevitable problem which will arise in modern commercial litigation which often involves transnational cross-border elements. With the geographical proximity between Singapore and Indonesia and with the easy means of travel between the two countries, I did not consider the movement of witnesses and evidence to be an insuperable difficulty for any of the parties to the litigation. Similarly, I did not regard the need to translate documents either from English to Bahasa Indonesia or vice versa to be a factor that weighed heavily in favour of any party. In the result, I found that the location of the evidence in the circumstances of this case to be neutral.
49. Similarly, I found that the place where the parties carried on business to be a neutral factor. The second plaintiff and the defendant were companies incorporated in Singapore whereas the first plaintiff was a company incorporated under Indonesian law.
50. Counsel for the defendant next referred me to the fact that there were pending proceedings in Indonesia; the defendant commenced those proceedings, known under Indonesian law as the complaint, in May 1995 against both plaintiffs, AYL and Se Nga for a declaration that the 1st JVA was void and claiming the sum of $8m as damages. The Indonesian proceedings were commenced before the defendant had taken its Indonesian lawyers' advice on the issue of the validity of the 1st JVA in the light of the existence of the 2nd JVA. In view of this advice, the defendant's Indonesian counsel had applied to have the complaint amended to ask the Indonesian court to make a determination on the validity of the 1st JVA vis a vis the 2nd JVA.
51. Counsel for the plaintiffs, in reply, contended that the proceedings commenced by the defendant in Indonesia were not genuine but started only for defensive purposes, to preclude any action from later being brought in Singapore. The defendant had no sincere desire to litigate in Indonesia and this was evidenced by the fact that, although the Indonesian action was commenced almost a year before the hearing of this application, the defendant had taken no positive steps to pursue the Indonesian action; it remained at the infant stage. Furthermore, notice of the proceedings in Indonesia was only given to the plaintiffs in March 1996, almost 10 months after it was commenced.
52. In de Dampierre v De Dampierre < 1988 > 1 AC 92, Lord Goff made the following remarks (at p 108) about the relevance of a lis alibi pendens when considering whether or not to order a stay of proceedings:
However, the existence of such proceedings may, depending on the circumstances, be relevant to the inquiry. Sometimes they may be of no relevance at all, for example, if one party has commenced the proceedings for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competing jurisdiction, or the proceedings have not passed beyond the stage of the initiating process. But if, for example, genuine proceedings have been started and have not merely been started but have developed to the stage where they have had some impact upon the dispute between the parties, especially if such impact is likely to have a continuing effect, then this may be a relevant factor to be taken into account when considering whether the foreign jurisdiction provides the appropriate forum for the resolution of the dispute between the parties.
53. While I agreed with counsel for the plaintiffs' suggestion that there had been considerable delay in service of the Indonesian proceedings, I could not accept counsel's contention that the inescapable conclusion from the passive conduct of the defendant subsequent to the commencement of the Indonesian proceedings was that it had no genuine intention to pursue the proceedings in Indonesia. I did not think that the Indonesian proceedings were purely tactical in nature. Counsel for the defendant's explanation was that the delay in the service of process of the Indonesian proceedings was because service of process under Indonesian law had to be effected through official channels. I accepted that this must have partly contributed to the delay in the service of process.
54. But what was more crucial, I thought, was the fact that it was not disputed that the Indonesian action had not proceeded beyond the initiating stages. Other than the action being commenced and service effected on the plaintiffs, as of May 1996, nothing else had been done as yet. I found that the Indonesian action had not developed to a stage where it would impact upon the dispute between the parties in the sense of extra inconvenience or expense by having the Singapore action continue in Singapore because the same issues would have already been litigated in Indonesia. Therefore, I was of the view that the lis alibi pendens in this case did not decisively point to Indonesia being a clearly and distinctly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action; it was at most a neutral factor.
55. To show that Indonesia could not be the natural or clearly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action, counsel for the plaintiffs relied heavily on the fact that there were proceedings that had been commenced in Singapore that were directly related and relevant to the action in this suit. These proceedings counsel argued, were genuine and had proceeded beyond the preliminary stages such that there would be a significant and lasting impact on this action. Effectively, counsel was suggesting that these proceedings had developed to such a degree that they had made Singapore the natural forum for the trial of this action. While I realised that it was the defendant who bore the legal burden throughout the first stage of the inquiry under the Spiliada guidelines to show that Indonesia was clearly and distinctly a more appropriate forum, the evidential burden was on the plaintiffs, in this particular respect, to establish that Singapore had become the natural forum because of the concurrent proceedings within jurisdiction.
56. In my view, there were two ways in which concurrent proceedings in Singapore may be relevant in the exercise of the discretion whether to order a stay of proceedings under the Spiliada principles. First, the concurrent proceedings in Singapore may amount to what is now commonly known as a Cambridgeshire factor. If the requirements to demonstrate a Cambridgeshire factor is established, then, in all likelihood, the court will exercise its discretion to refuse a stay of the subject action. As will be explained below, the existence of a Cambridgeshire factor is an exceptional occurrence. Secondly, concurrent proceedings in Singapore, which are related to the subject action, may be relevant to show that Singapore is a more natural forum for the trial of the action in the same manner that a lis alibi pendens in a foreign jurisdiction may be relevant to show that the forum abroad is clearly and distinctly a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. Subject to the caveat stated immediately below, generally, the same considerations set out in the speech of Lord Goff in de Dampierre v de Dampierre (supra) quoted above, on the relevance of lis alibi pendens in a foreign forum are equally applicable to the concurrent proceedings in Singapore. However, for obvious reasons, there will hardly ever be cases of a true lis alibi pendens within the same jurisdiction. The concurrent proceedings within jurisdiction will almost always be related proceedings in terms of common or similar issues of law and fact rather than proceedings involving exactly the same parties and exactly the same issues of law and fact, arising from the same or related causes of action. Related proceedings within jurisdiction may be defined as those which, although not arising from the same cause of action, are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear them together to avoid irreconciliable judgments from separate proceedings and unnecessary costs and inconvenience. In such cases, although the concurrent proceedings are relevant, I think it is clear that the policy reasons with respect to the undesirability of lis alibi pendens do not apply with as much force.
57. There were three sets of related proceedings that had, at the time of this hearing, been commenced in Singapore. First, there was Suit No 947 of 1995 ('the defamation action'). The second plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant and Guthrie GTS Ltd claiming damages for allegedly defamatory statements in interviews given by one the defendant's representatives, Peter McMillan, to the media in March 1995 concerning the second plaintiff's responsibility in the failure to complete the resort. Secondly, there were also 14 separate suits started by apartment owners of the resort against PTG, Guthrie GTS Ltd, the defendant and both plaintiffs alleging, inter alia, that the defendant and both plaintiffs had misrepresented and/or conspired to injure the apartment owners as to the following matters - that the defendant had control over the development of the resort and that the parties had no intention to complete the resort, including the building of the marina, by June 1993 ('the apartment owners' suits'). Thirdly, there was Suit No 1708 of 1993. In this suit, a firm of architects was suing PTG, GPMS, the defendant and both plaintiffs, in several alternative claims, for its fees for work done in the resort ('the architects' action'). All three sets of proceedings in Singapore had yet to proceed to trial as at the time of the hearing of this application for a stay. 58. In Spiliada, the House of Lords expressly acknowledged that a relevant factor when applying the principle of forum non conveniens is the fact that there are concurrent proceedings within the same jurisdiction which are related to the action sought to be stayed and which have proceeded to such an advanced stage of litigation that considerations of expense, convenience and the expeditious dispatch of justice would require the court to refuse a stay of proceedings. This factor was referred to in the judgment as the Cambridgeshire factor, named after the concurrent action which was proceeding in England in Spiliada.
In the subsequent case of Societe Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak < 1987 > 1 AC 871, a case dealing with restraint of foreign proceedings, the House of Lords clarified that the Cambridgeshire factor could not be applied broadly in all situations, but was only of relevance in the exceptional circumstance when the concurrent proceedings within jurisdiction had proceeded to such an advanced stage that the build-up of expertise in the concurrent proceedings practically made it a complete waste of resources and time if a stay was ordered. At p 898 of the report of Lee Kui Jak, Lord Goff said:
In Spiliada's case the question at issue was the effect of wet sulphur upon the holds of ships. This question was of profound importance, not only to the shipping industry, but to the whole sulphur exporting industry in British Columbia. The first case in which the question was investigated in depth was concerned with a ship called the Cambridgeshire, and was plainly recognised as in the nature of a test case.
Armies of lawyers and experts were engaged. An enormous amount of preparatory work was undertaken; the documentation was voluminous in the extreme. The scientific investigation was of a most fundamental kind, and indeed approached the limits of scientific knowledge. The trial of the Cambridgeshire action was begun and had proceeded for about a month when the application was made for a stay of proceedings in Spiliada's case, a parallel case raising the same profound scientific questions as those which had arisen in the Cambridgeshire. The application came on for hearing before Staughton J., the trial judge in the Cambridgeshire action. In these somewhat unusual circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that he regarded the building up of expertise and understanding among the teams of lawyers and experts in England as a relevant factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not to order a stay of the English proceedings in Spiliada's case; this view was shared by the House of Lords, where it was pointed out that, in addition, the parties in both actions were substantially the same -- Cansulex Ltd. being defendants in both actions, and the plaintiff shipowners in both actions being insured by the same P. and I. club who were financing and controlling both sets of proceedings, and instructing the same lawyers in both .
59. As can be seen from the quoted remarks of Lord Goff, the Cambridgeshire factor is only relevant in unusual and exceptional circumstances. It is not a factor of broad application whenever the doctrine of forum non coveniens is applied. I did not find that the other three sets of proceedings being carried on in Singapore were of such a nature or had proceeded to such a degree that they could qualify as Cambridgeshire factors. With respect to the defamation action commenced by the second plaintiff, the nature of the issues and question of liability raised were fundamentally different from those in these proceedings. Counsel for the plaintiffs could not persuade me otherwise. As for the architects' action, again the issues raised were completely different from those in this action. There was clearly insufficient connection with this action. Finally, in terms of the issues raised, although the apartments' owners suits bore some similarity with those raised in this case, counsel for the plaintiffs failed to establish any build-up of any form of expertise or complexity of the issues involved which even came close to resembling the situation in Spiliada. I would also add that an important factor in my consideration was the fact that none of the three actions had proceeded to trial at the hearing of this application for a stay. Clearly then, I found, without any hesitation, that counsel for the plaintiffs had not satisfied me that the three sets of proceedings within jurisdiction were Cambridgeshire factors that had made Singapore the natural forum for the hearing of this action.
60. For generally the same reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, I also found that these local proceedings, although clearly genuine in nature, were not of such relevance to the subject action that they could show that Singapore was a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. The local proceedings did not deal with the same issues and they had not advanced to a stage that would significantly impact upon this case. Foremost in my mind also was the fact these local proceedings were not true lis alibi pendens, that is, they were not concurrent proceedings involving the same parties to the subject action and they did not involve the same issues of fact and law, arising from the same or related causes of action. The rationale for the relevance of lis alibi pendens as a factor in applying the Spiliada principles thus did not apply with very much force in this case. There would be no true danger of estoppel as the parties and issues were different. There would also be no true consequential savings of time and costs for the parties to this action even if a stay was refused, because the concurrent local actions would proceed regardless of the result of this application for a stay, unlike in the classic case of a true lis alibi pendens, eg. The Abidin Daver, where the grant of a stay would result in only one set of proceedings being carried on. Hence, the existence of the local proceedings could not persuade me that Singapore was a more natural forum for the trial.
61. In my opinion, there was another relevant factor that pointed towards Indonesia as a clearly and distinctly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action which had not been given enough attention by counsel for the defendant. Section 24 of the 1st JVA set out the parties' choice of law and jurisdiction as follows:
24.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Country < Indonesia > .
24.2 Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts of Central Jakarta but without prejudice to the right of any thereof to commence action or bring suit against each and every other party in any Court having jurisdiction but for this Section 24.2 In relation to any proceedings in Singapore, an appeal from a decision of the appellate court in Singapore in such proceedings may be brought by any party before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the parties further irrevocably agree to be bound by an appeal to, and a decision of, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in such proceedings....
Section 24.2 was an unusually worded clause. It started off by providing that the parties would submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts of Central Jakarta. But it ended by providing that, notwithstanding the parties' submission to the District Courts' exclusive jurisdiction, each party would retain the right to commence action in any other country which had jurisdiction to hear the action, and this would include, of course, Singapore. The first question that came to mind was whether section 24.2 was an exclusive jurisdiction clause which attracted the application of the well-known principles set out by Brandon J in The Eleftheria < 1970 > P 94 (later repeated by the same judge in The El Amria < 1981 > 2 Lloyd's Rep 119) which was applied in Singapore by the Court of Appeal in Amerco Timbers Pte Ltd v Chatsworth Timber Corp Pte Ltd < 1977 > 2 MLJ 181.
62. It is a question of construction whether a jurisdiction clause in a contract is an exclusive or a non-exclusive one (see Sohio Supply Co v Gatoil (USA) Inc < 1989 > 1 Lloyd's Rep 588 at p 591; British Aerospace v Dee Howard < 1993 > 1 Lloyd's Rep 368 at p 373). It is settled law that it is for the proper law of the contract to determine questions of construction of the terms of the contract. It seemed to me, therefore, that whether section 24.2 of the 1st JVA would be construed as an exclusive jurisdiction clause was a question of construction that had to be determined by the proper law governing the 1st JVA, Indonesian law. The only evidence of Indonesian law on this point that I had before me was a legal opinion rendered by the plaintiffs' Indonesian counsel exhibited in AYL's first affidavit. The relevant portion of the legal opinion reads:
The text of Section 24.2 of the JVA seems ambiguous. On the one hand, the first part of the first sentence mentions exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts of Central Jakarta, while on the other hand the second part of the first sentence states that the parties to the JVA have the right to commence action in any Court having jurisdiction. Furthermore, the second sentence of this Section 24.2 explicitly refers to proceedings in Singapore.
According to Indonesian law, the interpretation of a clause in an agreement may not only depend on the text of such (sic) clause, but also on the intention of the parties at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement. Relevant in this respect is the meaning which the parties, based on their declarations and acts, (i) could reasonably attribute to such clause and (ii) could reasonably expect from each other.
The intention of the parties can, for example, be derived from negotiations and discussions parties had on the JVA and in particular this Section. Such information is, at this moment, not available to us.
As it may be obvious, I did not find this opinion to be particularly helpful in determining the nature of the Section 24.2. There was no evidence of the parties' reasonable expectations of each other with respect to the clause or the meaning they attributed to it. Consequently, I took the view that there was effectively no evidence of whether this section would be regarded as an exclusive jurisdiction clause under Indonesian law.
63. Therefore, with respect to this specific question of construction and nothing more, I regarded Indonesian law to be the same as Singapore law. On normal principles of construction under our law, section 24.2 appeared to me to be a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause choosing the District Courts of Central Jakarta as the choice of forum. The natural reading of section 24.2 was as follows: the parties agreed to submit exclusively to the jurisdiction of the District Courts of Central Jakarta; however, each party retained the right to commence a suit elsewhere as if they had never agreed to submit exclusively to the District Courts of Central Jakarta. Thus, the principles in The Eleftheria (supra) did not apply. The doctrine of forum non conveniens applied.
64. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the presence of a non- exclusive jurisdiction clause specifically choosing Indonesia as the forum for trial of the action showed that, prima facie, the parties had agreed that Indonesia would be an appropriate forum for the trial of the action than elsewhere. Jurisdiction agreements, though they may be non-exclusive in nature, should be respected and, when possible, upheld. Of course, there may be other fori in which an action concerning a breach of the 1st JVA may be brought, but Indonesia would clearly be an appropriate forum for the trial of an action arising out of a breach of the 1st JVA. So the parties have agreed. The plaintiffs should not be heard to argue that Indonesia would not be appropriate forum for the trial of this action. Authority for this proposition may be found in S & W Berisford plc v New Hampshire Insurance Co < 1990 > 3 WLR 688 where, Hobhouse J, after concluding that a clause in an insurance policy was a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause and not an exclusive jurisdiction clause, went on to say (at p 694):
Such a clause, even though creating no obligation to sue only in England is a contractual acknowledgement of the jurisdiction of the English courts and a contractual agreement to the invocation of that jurisdiction ... Therefore I conclude that this clause is not an exclusive jurisdiction clause. As I pointed out in Cannon Screen Entertainment Ltd. v Handmade Films (Distributors) Ltd. such a conclusion does not mean that the clause ceases to be relevant in relation to an application such as that which is being made by the defendants on this summons. If the contract says that the assured is entitled to sue the underwriter in the English courts, then it requires a strong case for the courts of this jurisdiction to say that that right shall not be recognised and that he must sue elsewhere.
And at p 702 of the report, Hobhouse J added:
< T > he fact that the parties have agreed in their contract that the English courts shall have jurisdiction (albeit a non- exclusive jurisdiction) creates a strong prima facie case that that jurisdiction is an appropriate one; it should in principle be a jurisdiction to which neither party to the contract can object as inappropriate; they have both implicitly agreed that it is appropriate.
65. Having said that, I would add a note of caution to my comments above. I would not go so far as Waller J in British Aerospace v Dee Howard < 1993 > 1 Lloyd's Rep 368 (at pp 375-377) who advocated a novel approach to cases where the parties have freely agreed to a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause choosing a particular jurisdiction for litigation. Waller J suggested that in such cases, the parties should be precluded from raising, in an application for a stay, any factor that would have been eminently foreseeable at the time they entered into the contact.
Factors such as the inconvenience of witnesses, the location of documents and the timing of trial cannot be raised by a party seeking a stay of action in favour of another jurisdiction. Waller J's approach is both distinct from the doctrine of forum non conveniens as set out in Spiliada as well as the principles of stay in the light of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in The Eleftheria, and I would suggest appears to be a hybrid of the two latter approaches. I preferred, instead, the approach of Hobhouse J in Berisford who considered that a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause would be considered merely as one of the factors, albeit a strong one, which went to determining the appropriateness or otherwise of a particular jurisdiction. In this case, the parties have chosen Indonesia as their choice of jurisdiction for the settlement of disputes. This is one very relevant factor that pointed towards Indonesia as an appropriate forum for the trial of this action.
66. There were several other factors referred to by counsel for the defendant that indicated to me clearly that Indonesia was a distinctly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action. I shall list them out accordingly:
(1) The central subject of the 1st or 2nd JVA is the construction of the Indah Puri Resort, and this project was to be carried out entirely in Indonesia.
(2) PTG, the joint venture vehicle, was to be a corporate entity created and governed by Indonesian law.
(3) The relationship between the parties, whether contractually or pre-contractually, was governed by Indonesian law. (4) The alleged breaches relating to the meetings of 9 January and 31 January 1996 occurred in Indonesia.
67. In the light of the foregoing considerations, I was of the view that, at the conclusion of the first stage of enquiry under the approach in Spiliada towards the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, the defendant had shown that Indonesia was clearly and distinctly a more appropriate forum for the trial of this action. The onus then shifted to the plaintiffs to show that there were reasons of justice for a stay of action to be refused and proceedings in this action be allowed to carry on in Singapore.
68. Counsel for the plaintiffs sought to impress upon me that the plaintiffs would be deprived of a substantial juridical advantage if a stay of action was granted, in that interim relief in the form of an interlocutory injunction pending the trial of the dispute would be available in Singapore but not in Indonesia. Although counsel was unable to cite any case authority in support of her proposition that the availability of interim relief would be regarded as a legitimate juridical advantage, I was, nevertheless, willing to accept that being able to restrain the defendant from acting on purported breaches of the 1st JVA before trial would doubtless be an advantage to the plaintiffs.
69. However, it is clear from the speech of Lord Goff in Spiliada that the fact that a party may be deprived of a legitimate personal or juridical advantage does not ipso facto mean that a stay of action will be ordered, provided that substantial justice can still be achieved by trial in the competing jurisdiction. Further elaborating on this in de Dampierre v de Dampierre (supra) Lord Goff said (at p 110 of the report) in the context of the proper treatment by the courts of a legitimate personal or juridical advantage,
The weight to be given to what has been called a 'legitimate personal or juridical advantage' was considered by your Lordships' House in the Spiliada case < 1987 > AC 460, 484-484. The conclusion there reached was that, having regard to the underlying principle, the court should not, as a general rule, be deterred from granting a stay of proceedings simply because the plaintiff in this country will be deprived of such an advantage, provided that the court is satisfied that substantial justice will be done in the appropriate forum overseas. Reference was made, in particular, to cases concerning discovery where, as is well known, there is a spectrum of systems of discovery applicable in various jurisdictions; and the opinion was expressed that, generally speaking, injustice cannot be said to be done if a party is compelled to accept one of these well recognised systems of discovery in another forum.
Lord Templeman added the following pertinent comments at p 101 of the report:
The court must consider whether in all the circumstances it is just that the plaintiff should be allowed to exploit and enforce his English advantage and should only refuse a stay if it would be unjust to confine the plaintiffs to his remedies elsewhere.
70. In this case, I was less than satisfied that, in the circumstances of the case, the plaintiffs would be deprived of substantial justice in Indonesia, if indeed their allegations against the defendant were well-founded. Counsel failed to discharge her onus of demonstrating to me how it would be unjust if the plaintiffs were made to litigate in Indonesia other than merely establishing the unavailability of interim relief there. Consequently, while I accepted that the plaintiffs would suffer from this juridical disadvantage if the action was stayed in Singapore, this, in my judgment, fell far short of establishing that the plaintiffs would be deprived of substantial justice if the action was heard in Indonesia. In this regard, I also had in mind the observations of Lord Diplock in The Abidin Daver (supra) where his Lordship warned (at p 410) against courts engaging in the invidious task of comparing the quality of justice obtainable under a common law system of procedure, like ours, and that obtainable under a civil law system, as in Indonesia. In this day and age, judicial chauvinism must bow to international comity.
71. Counsel for the plaintiffs then canvassed the argument that there would be excessive delay if trial were to take place in Indonesia. According to the advice of the plaintiffs' Indonesian lawyers, in the form of an opinion exhibited in the first affidavit of AYL, proceedings in the District Court at Central Jakarta may take between six months to two years to complete. However, there were many ways to delay proceedings in Indonesia and the Indonesian lawyers knew of three instances where cases have taken more than ten years to reach trial.
72. I was unable to accept counsel's contention. I was not satisfied that the plaintiffs had sufficiently established with cogent evidence that there would be excessive delay if the trial took place in Indonesia. With all due respect to counsel, evidence of a mere three cases which have taken more than ten years to reach trial without providing me with any other details of the court system in the District Court of Central Jakarta, such as the mean length of time which a case would take to reach trial or the timetable for the steps to be taken before the matter is set down for trial, was woefully insufficient to establish delay of such magnitude that would deny the plaintiffs substantial justice if a stay of action was granted. The case of The Vishva Ajay < 1989 > 2 Lloyd's Rep 558 cited to me by counsel for the plaintiffs was clearly distinguishable on the ground that, in that case, there was a substantial body of evidence placed before Sheen J that many actions begun in Bombay did not reach trial in less than ten years and that it would be wholly exceptional for an action to come on for trial in less than six years. In such circumstances, Sheen J was prepared to hold that there would be a denial of justice if trial took place in Bombay. Quite clearly, the situation before me was far removed from that before Sheen J, and I respectfully declined to find that the plaintiffs in this case would be deprived of justice if trial took place in Indonesia because of delay.
73. Furthermore, I was of the view that the implicit allegation by counsel that the defendant would take all steps to deliberately delay proceedings in Indonesia was unwarranted, to say the least, in the absence of any evidence that the defendant had previously been guilty of such tactics vis- -vis the plaintiffs in this action or in any other connected proceedings. In any event, any such conduct on the part of the defendant could be easily be circumvented by an appropriate order that a stay of action should be granted subject to the proviso that the defendant would take all necessary steps to expedite the Indonesian action against the plaintiffs and granting the parties full liberty to apply in the event that the defendant breaches the proviso.
74. I would also add that, since the parties had agreed in the 1st JVA on the non-exclusive choice of an Indonesian forum, they had agreed that Indonesia prima facie would be an appropriate forum for the settlement of their disputes. Consequently, it was difficult for me to accept how the plaintiffs could now legitimately complain that it would be unjust for them to litigate with the defendant in Indonesia especially with regard to a factor such as delay in proceedings in Indonesia which surely would have been known to the parties at the time of contracting.
75. Finally, as for the lis alibi pendens in Indonesia, for the same reasons mentioned earlier that I found this factor to be a neutral one in the first stage of the Spiliada enquiry, I also found it to be a neutral factor at this second stage of the Spiliada enquiry. In other words, the pending Indonesian action, due to its infancy, was not a factor that could be taken into account against the plaintiffs in the sense of showing that the defendant had a corresponding personal advantage in litigating in Indonesia.
Conclusion 76. Indonesia being clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of the action than in Singapore, I found that the plaintiffs had not satisfied me that there were reasons of justice for me not to order a stay of these proceedings in Singapore. I, therefore, granted the defendant's application in Summons-in-Chamber 1905 of 1996 for a stay of all further proceedings in this action adding at the same time, the proviso that the defendant should take all necessary steps to expedite the proceedings in Case No 252/Pdt/G/1995/PN.JKT.PST filed in the Central District Court of Jakarta on 22 May 1995. In the premises, it became unnecessary for me to hear arguments on the plaintiffs' application by way of Notice of Motion No. 49 of 1996 for interim relief, and I dismissed that application accordingly.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
1. The accused was charged with importing into Singapore without authorisation a quantity of substance containing not less than 3,468g of diamorphine thereby contravening s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Ch 185. The evidence adduced was as follows:
2. At about 11.15pm on 23 July 1994, customs officer Wang Khai Wah (""CO Wang"") was on duty at the Green Channel opposite Belts 35 and 36 at Terminal 2 in Changi Airport when he spotted a male passenger pushing a trolley walking towards the customs clearance gates from the direction of Belt 37. On the trolley were a brown bag and a small white paper bag. He thought that the behaviour of the passenger was somewhat suspicious and he approached the passenger and asked for his passport. The passenger (accused)produced a Thai passport in the name of Aung Myat. On being questioned the accused told CO Wang that he would be staying in Singapore for one night and that he would be leaving for Philippines the next day. CO Wang asked the accused to follow him to the customs checking counter. The accused did so. The accused had arrived in Singapore on board Silkair Flight MI 895 from Hatyai, Thailand. The plane had docked at 10.56pm.
3. At the counter CO Wang emptied the leather bag of its contents. In doing so he noticed that the inner linings on both sides of the bag were bulging. He also felt the bag to be heavier than what a bag of its size should be. The small white paper bag carried by the accused contained a toothbrush and a tube of toothpaste (both unused). CO Wang asked the accused to re-pack his bag and follow him to the customs duty office. The accused did so.
4. At about 11.25pm senior customs officer Ang Sin Ban (""SCO Ang"") arrived at the duty office. CO Wang showed him the bag and contents. SCO Ang examined the bag. The bag looked normal from the outside but on the inside the linings of the bag, made of material that was quite hard, was bulging. SCO Ang offered a cutter to the accused and asked the accused to cut open the lining. The accused asked SCO Ang to cut it himself. SCO Ang made a small slit along the lining. He saw some whitish powder inside. SCO Ang then went to get his test kit and tested a small sample of the white powder. The test indicated that it contained heroin.
5. In cross-examination, CO Wang told the court that after the bag was cut SCO Ang had asked the accused what the substance was and the accused had replied to the effect that it was ""stones, someone asked me to carry for him"". This evidence had not been disclosed at the preliminary inquiry nor had CO Wang mentioned it when giving evidence-in-chief. SCO Ang, who gave evidence after CO Wang, was asked if he had asked the accused what the substance was. He replied that he had not. He also said that the accused did not say anything to him except for asking after the test was completed, ""Sir, is it drug?"" When told what CO Wang had said, SCO Ang said that he could not remember if such a conversation occurred.
6. At about 1am SCO Ang informed the accused that he was under arrest for a drug offence. He was searched and all items found on him were seized. Amongst the items recovered from the accused were:
(1) Myanmar passport No 026786 of Aung Myat with photograph of the accused.
(2) Singapore disembarkation form (Singapore address: Jalan 24, Lorong 24).
(3) Silkair Boarding Pass (23 July 1994, Flight MI 895, Hatyai/Singapore, boarding time 2005).
(4) Airline ticket with baggage tag attached (23 July 1994, 20.35 Hatyai/Singapore, MI 895 RQ 24 July 1994, 10.00 Singapore/Cebu, MI 542 OK).
(5) Cash comprising 8 pieces of US$100, 2 pieces of 100 Thai bahts, 1 piece of 20 Thai bahts
(6) 2 pieces of paper with Burmese writing. One of these (P.36B) was a receipt for a fine of 800 issued to Aung Myat on 23 July 1994 at Hatyai Airport for overstaying. The other piece of paper (P.36A) contained the following information:
(a) Singapore airport flight information telephone No 221-2221. If journey breaks for overnight in Singapore, to stay No 23, Jalan 24, Lorong 24, Tel No. 744-4468.
(b) Upon arrival in Philippines, to rent a room in a hotel and then place a call to Maung Maung, Tel No. 237-1405.
(c) To rent a room in Cebu (Philippines) at Anaci Letus Tourist Inn (Cebu) 314-910; 314-921.
(7) 3 photographs of the accused (two of these were identical to the photograph of the accused in the passport).
(8) A small telephone book with entries mainly in Burmese. Among the entries in the telephone book was:-
Maung Maung Pg: 1144/575-689 Handphone: 01-498-0438.
(9) In the bag there were 5 shirts, 2 shorts, 1 long pants, 1 singlet and 7 T-shirts. Except for 1 shirt and 1 singlet, all the other items appeared new and unused.
(10) In the white paper bag there was a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush. Both were new and unused.
7. Chief customs officer Michael Koh Keng Siang (""CCO Koh"") of the surveillance division was summoned to the customs duty office at 11.30pm. From about 12.05am to 2.30am he was alone with the accused. They were seated at a sofa set in an adjoining room. During this period CCO Koh questioned the accused off and on about the accused's background and how the accused came to be carrying the bag into Singapore. He spoke to the accused in English. At about 4.30am, after Inspector Ong Peng Boon and other officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (""CNB"") had taken the accused away, CCO Koh made rough notes of what the accused had said on a piece of paper. Subsequently, on 25 July 1994, when he was in his office he transferred what he had noted on the paper to his pocket book. The entry he made in his pocket book was as follows:
Accd spoke to me in English and also voluntarily divulged the following:-
He is working as a bread seller in Bangkok with meagre income. Stayed Bkk for last 6 yrs. Recruited by another male Myanmese called ""Maung Maung"" and offered US$3000/- to bring said brown bag which he belief to contain ""stones"" to Cebu via S'pore. He was paid half in advance (part of which he had spent on himself and also sent some to his family in Myanmar). Balance half would be paid on completion of assignment. There are many Nepalese and Myanmese in Bangkok who have been recruited by ""Maung Maung"" who works for an African syndicate. Many Caucasians also involved who are seldom checked by authorities at checkpoints. He took a flight from Bkk to Hdy. In Hdy, he was given 2 options by ""Maung Maung"". Firstly, to hand carry the brown bag on board flight from Hdy to S'pore. On arrival at S'pore, to remain in transit area till the following morning for connecting flight to Cebu.
Secondly, the brown bag would be checked in by someone in Hdy airport. On arrival in S'pore, he would pick up the bag and deposit at left baggage after customs clearance and subsequently would stay at Geylang Lor 24. Would pick up bag the following morning for departure to Cebu. He chose option 2 as he considered option 1 too risky. He was shown the bag in Hdy and later given the air ticket and baggage tag. He also claimed there were 2 other Myanmese in Hdy hotel but could not depart as they did not have the goods. He also said that his photo on the passport was just taken and had recently been affixed to the passport.
8. CCO Koh said that he questioned the accused in order to gather intelligence which might be useful in his work. He did not relay the information that he gathered from the accused to the Inspector Ong Peng Boon or anyone else from the CNB as the information he obtained was for intelligence purposes and not for use in court. He agreed that in his pocket book he did not write the words used by the accused and that some of the words like ""syndicate"", ""Caucasians"" and ""options"" were not used by the accused, in writing up the note in his pocket book he had put in these words himself. CCO Koh agreed that what he wrote in the pocket book contained more details than what he had noted on the paper. He told the court that after writing up his pocket book he destroyed the piece of paper on which he had made rough notes.
9. Inspector Ong Peng Boon (""the IO"") and a party of officers from the CNB arrived at the customs duty office at about 2.05am to take over the investigation. SCO Ang briefed them on the case and at 2.30am he handed over the accused and the exhibits seized to the IO. The IO in the presence of the accused cut the inside lining on either side of the bag. He scooped out the white powder therein into two separate bundle and weighed each bundle. He then had the accused sent for medical examination.
10. The IO told the court that at that time he did not know that the accused's real name was not Aung Myat or that the accused was travelling on a false passport. He also did not know that customs officers had spoken to the accused and obtained information from him. He did not subsequently ask the customs officers involved whether they had gathered any information from the accused as he did not want to probe into the workings of another investigative authority.
11. At about 5.45am at his office at the CNB, the IO, with the assistance of a Burmese interpreter (Marlar Swe), formally charged the accused for the offence of importing diamorphine into Singapore and recorded a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (""CPC""). No objection was taken on the admissibility of the statement and it was admitted in evidence. In the s 122(6) statement the accused said, ""I have nothing to say."" Later that morning the accused was charged in court and remanded at the Criminal Investigation Department (""CID"").
12. On 27 July 1994, with the assistance of the same Burmese interpreter, the IO commenced recording a long statement from the accused. It was at this time that the IO learnt that the passport the accused was using was a false passport and that the accused's real name was Hla Win. The IO continued recording this long statement on 28 and 29 July and on 2 August 1994. He recorded further statements from the accused on 7 September 1994. The prosecution did not seek to adduce these statements in evidence but the defence sought their admission.
13. The IO had, very properly sought to verify the accuracy of what the accused had said in his long statement. He had sought to do so through Interpol by the Thai police. He had however not received the results of their investigation. The IO told the court that he was not surprised at this as it was not unusual for Interpol to take many months to complete its investigations. Obviously the hearing of this case had come up too soon for the investigations at the Thai end to be completed.
14. When questioned by counsel, the IO said that he had not tried to get the manifest of the flight that the accused said he had taken from Bangkok to Hatyai from Thai Airways in Singapore because in his experience Thai Airways in Singapore would not supply information about Thai Airways in Bangkok. He therefore sought to obtain that information through the Thai police. He had also not tried to ascertain from Silkair Singapore details of when and by whom the Silkair flight from Hatyai to Cebu had been booked.
15. Urine samples were taken from the accused. The prosecution led evidence that on analysis these samples were found to contain morphine and codeine. As this evidence suggested that the accused could have consumed opiate drugs, Dr Lui Chi Pang, the chemist who analysed the urine, was asked in cross-examination by Dr Myint Soe whether he could confirm that morphine and codeine would be present in the urine if the subject had consumed certain cough mixtures. Dr Lui was not prepared to confirm this. He told the court that he knew that certain cough mixtures contained codeine but was not aware that cough mixtures also contained morphine. Dr Myint Soe told the court that that was not his understanding and that he would consult with a pharmacologist and try to establish that morphine and codeine would be present in the urine if the accused had consumed certain cough mixtures.
16. In re-examination, however, the learned DPP, Mr Ch'ng Lye Beng, ascertained from Dr Lui that Dr Lui had also conducted a quantitative analysis of the morphine and codeine content in order to ascertain the codeine to morphine ratio (C/M Ratio) in the specimen urine. Dr Lui told the court that the CM ratio in this case was such that he could rule out the possibility that the accused had consumed heroin. The learned DPP told the court that he was adducing this evidence in re-examination because this was evidence favourable to the defence and defence counsel had not cross-examined Dr Lui on this. On being asked by the court the learned DPP conceded that, in view of this evidence, the presence of the morphine and codeine in the accused's urine was a neutral fact and irrelevant to the charge against the accused.
17. At the preliminary inquiry no evidence had been given about the C/M Ratio. In Dr Lui's report tendered at the preliminary inquiry and in Dr Lui's evidence-in-chief before me, there was no mention that the amount of codeine and the amount of morphine had been ascertained and of the significance of the C/M ratio. Had the learned DPP in re- examination not elicited the additional evidence regarding the C/M ratio the impression would have been created that the accused was a heroin abuser. It was therefore fortuitous and very creditable that the learned DPP elicited this evidence from Dr Lui and erased this impression. It was unfortunate though that this evidence was not disclosed at the preliminary inquiry. Had it been disclosed, counsel would have been in a better position to cross-examine the chemist. It is trite to say that failure to disclose material evidence ca lead to a miscarriage of justice. The prosecution should disclose all material evidence at the earliest possible time in order to enable the defence to adequately prepare its case.
18. The two packets of white powder recovered from the bag were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and were found to contain no less than 3,468g of diamorphine. The learned DPP had indicated in his opening submission that the prosecution would be relying on the presumptions contained in ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Ch 185. On the evidence adduced and in the light of the presumptions, there clearly was a prima facie case made out that the accused had imported the heroin found in the bag into Singapore and I called upon the accused to make his defence.
19. The IO in this case had very painstakingly, with the assistance of a Burmese interpreter, recorded a detailed statement from the accused over many days. The defence raised by the accused was to a very large extent in conformity with what was contained in this long statement. In gist, the accused said that he was a Burmese by nationality, a Bengali by race and a Muslim by religion. His Burmese name was Hla Win and his Bengali/Muslim name was Mohd Akbar. He was born in 1964 at Kyaukphyu, a town near the border with Bangladesh. He told the court that because of the revolutionary conditions prevailing in Myanmar and his own disinclination towards studies his academic progress was slow. His primary education was in Bengali and Burmese. At the age of about 20 he went to the Myoma School in Yangon to further his secondary education. At Myoma School the medium of instruction was Burmese. English was a subject in his curriculum from the fifth standard. He told the court that his English was poor and that he hardly spoke in English.
20. At Myoma School the accused became involved in the student movement against the government. In 1988, he participated in riots to overthrow the government. When this was unsuccessful he fled to Thailand to avoid arrest by the Myanmar authorities. He had no passport and he went into Thailand as an illegal immigrant. Through the help ofsome Myanmar Muslims he was able to earn a living in Thailand as an itinerant roti prata seller. Sometimes he would work as a construction labourer. His life in Thailand was hard because he had always to be on guard against being arrested as an illegal immigrant. He told the court that on three occasions he had been arrested and imprisoned for being an illegal immigrant and sent back to the Myanmar border by the Thai authorities. On these occasions he had worked with the Karen rebels for short periods and then returned to Bangkok.
21. He had over the years, in order to avoid detection, stayed at different places around Bangkok. In 1994, he was staying in the Silom district where he plied his roti prata business around the Haroon mosque. This was a mosque frequented by Muslims from the Indian sub-continent. He said that he was himself a devout Muslim and attended prayers every Friday.
22. The accused told the court that in the course of his roti prata business and his attendances at that mosque he came to know a Chulia Muslim by the name of Maung Maung who was also from Myanmar. This Maung Maung was a moneychanger and a gem trader and carried on his business in the vicinity of the mosque. There were also other gem and jewellery shops and traders in the area. The accused told the court that Maung Maung appeared to him to be a successful businessman.
23. About 3 months after he came to know Maung Maung, Maung Maung took the accused to a tea shop for a chat. In the course of that conversation, the accused learnt that Maung Maung had come to Thailand from Myanmar about 4 years ago. The accused, in the course of that conversation, told Maung Maung that he was an illegal immigrant.
24. Subsequently, Maung Maung met the accused at the mosque and asked the accused to meet him at a McDonald's restaurant in the vicinity on 21 July 1994 morning. The accused did so and there Maung Maung told him over a meal that he wanted to send a bag of gems to some place and asked if the accused was interested. Maung Maung told the accused that he would be paid US$3,000 for the assignment of which US$1,500 would be paid in advance and the balance paid upon his return. The accused told Maung Maung that he had no passport but Maung Maung said that he would take care of that. The accused asked Maung Maung if the bag would contain only gems. Maung Maung assured the accused that that was so and that there would be nothing in the bag to get him into trouble. To convince the accused of his sincerity Maung Maung took the accused to the Haroon mosque and swore on the Koran that there would only be precious stones in the bag and that the accused would not get into trouble.
25. The accused told the court that he agreed to Maung Maung's suggestion because he believed that he would only be carrying precious stones. He said that he had at that time no reason to disbelieve Maung Maung because he knew that Maung Maung was a gem trader and in any case Maung Maung had sworn that the bag would only have precious stones. He knew that carrying precious stones out of Thailand and into other countries without declaring the precious stones was an offence but he was assured by Maung Maung and he knew that the penalty if caught would only be forfeiture of the gems and a short term of imprisonment. He therefore agreed to the proposal. Maung Maung then asked the accused to wait at McDonald's restaurant while he went to get the tickets. Shortly, Maung Maung returned and asked the accused to see him at the same restaurant the next day (22 July 1994) at 8am.
26. The accused kept the appointment the next morning and Maung Maung took him to a photo shop to have his photograph taken for the passport. The accused told the court that the three photographs seized from him when he was arrested was taken at this studio. Maung Maung told the accused to meet him again at 8pm that night at McDonald's restaurant. Maung Maung also gave to the accused his contact number and the accused noted this in his little telephone book. Pager No 1144/575-689 and handphone No 01-498-0438 appear in the telephone book seized from the accused against the name Maung Maung.
27. When the accused met Maung Maung that night, Maung Maung took him to a hotel room and asked him to wait there. About 1 hours later a male person came to the room. The accused spoke to the person in Thai. The person replied in Burmese that Maung Maung had sent him there. He introduced himself to the accused as Yusoof. The two of them spent the night in the room. Yusoof told the accused that he was a Myanmar Muslim and that for several years he had been staying in Singapore on a student pass. The accused also said that he had occasion to glance through the passport of Yusoof. The name on the passport was not Yusoof. The accused said that it was a Burmese name and although he could not remember the exact name it could have been Myo Lwin - the name appearing in a Thai Airways document shown to the accused by his counsel. The next morning Maung Maung met them at the lobby of the hotel and took them in a waiting taxi to Bangkok airport.
28. At the airport Maung Maung took out a brown bag (the one with which the accused was arrested) from the boot of the taxi. On the instructions of Yusoof the accused carried the bag and walked into the airport with Yusoof. The bag was quite heavy. At the counter Yusoof checked in for a flight to Hatyai. He also checked in the bag. Yusoof then handed to the accused a passport under the name of Aung Myat, a ticket to Hatyai and a boarding pass. The accused and Yusoof then took the flight to Hatyai. At Hatyai Yusoof took the accused to the Haadyai International Hotel where he checked into Room No 760. Yusoof took the bag into Room No 760 and placed it in the cupboard. The two then went out for lunch and then returned to the room.
29. Yusoof told the accused that he was to go to Cebu (in the Philippines) with the bag. To go to Cebu he would have to change planes at Singapore. Yusoof told him that he could wait in the transit area at Singapore airport for the change of plane. Yusoof also told the accused that he need not collect the bag as the bag would be put on the flight to Cebu by the airline staff. Yusoof asked the accused to familiarise himself with the particulars of Aung Myat in the passport and to practice the signature of Aung Myat. Yusoof also handed to the accused the Singapore immigration disembarkation form which he had filled up. They left the hotel for the airport at about 5.30pm. Before leaving the room Yusoof took out a long-sleeved shirt from the bag and asked the accused to wear it. The accused did so. Yusoof put the shirt that the accused took off into the bag.
30. Before leaving the hotel for the airport the accused told Yusoof that he wanted to buy some toiletries. Yusoof told the accused to wait while Yusoof went off and returned with a small white paper bag containing a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush which he gave to the accused.
31. On the way to the airport Yusoof gave the accused a slip of paper with Burmese writing on it. He told the accused that it contained instructions on what he was to do and asked the accused to read it. The accused read the paper. The paper (P.36A) had the number 221-2221 written on it as the Singapore Airport Flight Information Service telephone number. It also stated that if the journey broke overnight in Singapore he was to stay at No 23, Jalan 24, Lorong 24, telephone number 744-4468. The address and telephone number of the hotel he was to stay in at Cebu was also given. The note also asked that on reaching the hotel in Cebu he was to call Maung Maung at 237-1405. Yusoof also handed to the accused an envelope which contained US$800. This was part of the advance that Maung Maung had agreed to give him. He had asked Maung Maung to pay the balance of the advance to some creditors in Bangkok on his behalf.
32. The accused and Yusoof arrived at Hatyai airport at about 6.20pm. At the counter the staff told them that he could not check in yet because he did not have a confirmed ticket and was on the reserve list. He had to wait until closing time of the check-in in order to find out if there were any seats available (this is supported by the fact that on the airline ticket recovered from the accused the status of the flight from Hatyai to Singapore on MI 895 was listed as ""RQ""). It was only at about 8.15pm that the staff asked him to come forward and confirmed that a seat was available. Yusoof attended to the formalities of checking-in and then handed over the travel documents and 1,200 Thai bahts to the accused and showed the accused the way to the immigration counter. At the immigration counter the accused had some problems with his passport in that the passport showed that the holder had overstayed for 8 days. The accused said that he was fined 800 Thai bahts for overstaying. He paid the fine and was given a receipt.
33. When the plane landed in Singapore he left the plane and entered the terminal building. He was looking around when he was approached by a female staff who asked if she could help. He asked her in English, ""Transit room, where?"" She asked to see his ticket. She looked at it and told him that he had to collect his bag first (the baggage tag was pinned to the airline ticket). She then told him by words and gesticulation to go past the immigration counter, get his bag and then go upstairs for the flight to Cebu. The accused said that he was sure that Yusoof had told him that he need not worry about the bag as the bag would go straight to Cebu. He only collected the bag in Singapore because the lady told him that he had to collect the bag first before taking the plane to Cebu.
34. After clearing immigration he went to the luggage belt where he saw a European who had sat beside him waiting for his luggage. The accused also waited. Shortly, the bag arrived. He picked up the bag. He had some difficulties in operating the trolley on which he put the bag. He had at that time decided to take a taxi and spend the night at the place stated in the paper given to him. He was pushing the trolley and looking around when a customs officer came up to him and asked for his passport and air ticket. The officer looked at the documents and directed him to a counter. At the counter, as requested by the officer, he put the bag on the counter, opened it and took out the clothes therein. He told the court that that was the first time he had opened the bag. Except for the shirt that Yusoof had put into the bag in Hatyai, the rest of the clothing in the bag were not his.
35. The accused confirmed that at the customs duty office an officer had offered him a knife and asked him to cut the inside of the bag. He declined and had asked the officer to do so. He told the court that when the officer cut the bag he did not see any white powder. He was seated at the sofa and his view of the bag was obstructed by the officer. He told the court that the officer then went to a table near the sofa and put the knife into some liquid. The officer then asked him in English: ""What's this?"" The accused replied ""stone"" and at the same time gesticulated with his fingers the stone on a ring.
36. The accused told the court that he first saw that the bag contained white powder when another officer at a later stage cut open the bag. When he saw the white powder he felt sad because he realised he had been cheated. The accused confirmed that yet another officer was with him for a few hours that night. This officer had over this period intermittently questioned him in English about his background and how he came to be carrying the bag. He told the court that he replied as best he could whenever he understood what the officer was trying to say. He denied making those statements contained in the pocket book of the officer that were inconsistent with his testimony in court. In particular, he denied having said anything about an African syndicate - he did not even know what syndicate meant, he denied having referred to Caucasians being involved - he did not know what Caucasian meant, he denied having said that in Singapore he would be staying in Geylang - he did not know that there was such a place in Singapore and he denied having told the officer that Maung Maung was in Hatyai.
37. The accused told the court that from the airport he was taken to a hospital and at about daybreak he was taken to the office of the IO. There the IO spoke with him using a Burmese lady as an interpreter. The interpreter told him that the penalty for the offence was death. She also said that he would be taken to court the next morning but that was not the High Court and he could not say anything to the court. From the court he would be taken to the CID and a detailed statement would be taken from him. She told him that if he had anything to say he could say it there at the CNB. When she told him this he replied that he had nothing to say. The accused told the court that he said that because it was late and because the interpreter had told him that after he was taken to court the IO would take a full statement from him. He decided that he would tell the IO all he had to say when the full statement was recorded. Subsequently, he gave a detailed statement to the IO through the services of the same interpreter. Although the accused clarified and amplified certain parts of that statement he did not in the main dispute its accuracy.
38. Miss Sylvia Lim, the assistant counsel assigned by the registrar to defend the accused, gave evidence that in early January this year she wrote to Thai Airways in Singapore seeking details of the flight on 22 July 1994 on which Aung Myat had travelled from Bangkok to Hatyai. She received a response by fax on 14 February 1995, after this trial had commenced. Thai Airways faxed to her a passenger manifest printout (D.5C) of flight TG 233 on 23 July 1994 from Bangkok to Hatyai. Thai Airways also faxed to her a printout of what was termed a post date investigation printout (D.5B).
39. D.5B showed that one Maung Maung (telephone number 2918896) had on 22 July 1994 booked two tickets on flight TG 233 departing for Hatyai on 23 July 1994 in the names of MR AUNG/MYAT and MR MYO/LWIN. D.5C showed that these two persons were on flight TG 233 and that Aung Myat was allocated seat 36A and Myo Lwin was allocated seat 38F. Miss Teo also produced another computer printout (D.6) from the ""ROYAL ORCHID PLUS"" frequent flyer programme of Thai Airways in respect of Maung Maung. It listed Maung Maung as a member of this programme. It gave his business telephone number as 498-0438, his home telephone number as 0291- 8896 and his address as No 84/11, Soi Watrap Buakuao, Chardenkrung 80 Road, Bangkok. The printout also showed the mileage that had so far been credited to Maung Maung under the programme. It will be noted that the telephone number 498-0438 listed by Thai Airways as Maung Maung's business number in D.6 is the same number recorded by the accused in his telephone book as the number Maung Maung gave him.
40. The learned DPP in the course of his cross-examination of the accused appeared to be challenging the existence of Maung Maung. As the prosecution had not, when the trial commenced, completed its investigations into the accused's story they were obviously not aware of the fact that there was a Maung Maung in Bangkok and that it was Maung Maung who booked the ticket for the Thai Airways flight that the accused took on the morning of the day he was arrested. In the light of the evidence contained in Thai Airways' records obtained by the defence after the hearing started, I suggested to the learned DPP that he may like to consider building his case on the existence of such a person instead of wasting time by resisting the evidence from Thai Airways. After some consideration the DPP agreed that that would be an appropriate course for the prosecution to adopt.
41. Counsel for the defence went further in their investigative efforts. Miss Lim had, through correspondence with Haadyai International Hotel, managed to obtain a photocopy of the hotel registration card No 03217 relating to the occupation of Room No 760 on 23 July 1994. The defence sought to have that card admitted as evidence. The prosecution was reluctant to agree as what Miss Lim had was only a copy of the registration card. To avoid this technical difficulty Miss Lim, on 9 February 1995 in the course of the hearing, flew to Hatyai and obtained the original registration card. Whilst at Hatyai Miss Lim also obtained affidavits from the receptionist and cashier on duty at the hotel at the relevant time and whose handwriting was on the card. Miss Lim also took photographs of the hotel, photographs of Room No 760 and drew a sketch of the room.
42. The cashier in her affidavit (D.9) deposed that it was the practice of the hotel to require a guest to deposit his passport with them. If the guest did not wish to do so the guest would have to pay 1,000 bahts as a deposit. He can then fill in his particulars on the registration card without his particulars being verified. The guest who entered his particulars in registration card No 03217 had paid to her the sum of 1,000 bahts at the time he checked in. To her affidavit she annexed a copy of the hotel's bill/receipt No 3657 which indicated that the guest who registered on 23 July 1994 checked out of the hotel on 24 July 1994. The receptionist in her affidavit (D.8) deposed that she had allocated Room No 760 at 12.50pm on 23 July 1994 to the guest. As the guest had paid the 1,000 bahts she did not require the guest to produce his passport or verify the particulars that the guest wrote in the registration card. The affidavits were sworn before the Vice Consul of the Malaysian Embassy at Songkhla. Defence sought the admission of these affidavits under s 398 of the CPC. This was allowed.
43. The name of the guest as recorded in the registration card was Maung Maung. If that was indeed so, then that would contradict the accused's evidence that only Yusoof was with him at Hatyai. However, as the particulars in the card relating to the guest were filled in by the guest and were not verified by the receptionist, those particulars in the registration card were hearsay and inadmissible as to their truth.
44. At Hatyai Miss Lim had also done some shopping. She noticed that the paper bags used by a shop close to the hotel appeared similar to the paper bag that had been produced in court by the prosecution as the paper bag which the accused had with him when arrested. She obtained a paper bag by buying some goods at the shop. She brought the paper bag to court and found that the bag was identical to the bag produced in court and bore the name and logo of the same shop.
45. As the existence of Maung Maung and the existence of gem traders and gem stores in the vicinity of the Haroon mosque in the Silom district of Bangkok appeared to be an issue in the case, Miss Lim again flew to Thailand on the morning of Saturday, 18 February 1995. She returned the same evening. At the Silom district she took pictures of the Haroon mosque, of a McDonald's restaurant close by and of gem stores around the Haroon mosque. In addition, she located the address which, according to the records of Thai Airways (D.6), was the residence of Maung Maung and took a picture of the house. The accused identified the picture of the McDonald's restaurant as the restaurant where he had met Maung Maung. He also identified the pictures of the Haroon mosque and the gem stores in the vicinity. Miss Lim had also taken a picture of an open area near the mosque. The accused identified this picture as the area where gem traders and other traders gathered. He said that they would gather in the mornings and in the evenings. Miss Lim had taken the picture at about 3pm and so the place was relatively deserted. The accused could not identify the picture of Maung Maung's house as he had not been to Maung Maung's house. But looking at the picture it is obvious that it was the house of a person who was fairly well off.
46. By s 18(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, any person who is proved to have had in his possession or under his control anything containing a controlled drug is presumed, until the contrary is proven, to have the controlled drug in his possession. By s 18(2) of the Act a person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to know the nature of that drug. It was not in dispute that the accused was in possession of the brown bag. By virtue of these two provisions, a presumption arose that the accused was in possession of the powder concealed in the bag and that he knew that the powder was diamorphine.
47. Whilst the burden of proof was on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the onus, where a statutory presumption arose, was on the accused to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities. This has been clearly established in a long series of case amongst which are the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Tan Ah Tee v PP & Anor v PP (1) and Van Damme Johannes v PP (2).
48. Dr Myint Soe submitted that in this case the accused had more than sufficiently rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities and was therefore entitled to an acquittal. He went on to submit that there was authority to suggest that even when there were statutory presumptions the accused should be acquitted if at the close of the trial the court, even though not satisfied of his innocence on the balance of probabilities, was nevertheless left with some real, reasonable or nagging doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
49. Mohamad Radhi bin Yaakob v PP (3) was a decision of the Supreme Court of Malaysia. The appellant (who was with one Hashim who escaped) was when arrested in possession of a bag containing cannabis and was charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug. There was a presumption under s 37(d) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 that a person in custody or control of a bag containing a dangerous drug should be presumed, until the contrary was proved, to have been in possession of such drug and should until the contrary was proved be deemed to have known the nature of such drug. There was a further presumption under s 37(da) that a person in possession of 200g or more of cannabis was to be presumed to be trafficking in cannabis. Since the amount of cannabis recovered exceeded 200g the prosecution relied on both these presumptions to prove that the appellant was trafficking in cannabis. The appellant raised two defences:
(a) That Hashim was the owner of the bag containing the cannabis and the appellant was merely an innocent and temporary carrier who was carrying the bag while Hashim eased himself;
(b) It was Hashim and not he who was trafficking in the cannabis.
To prove (a) the appellant adduced evidence that that night Hashim had been at the appellant's house. They left the house at 11pm to buy cigarettes. At the shop the appellant went in to buy cigarettes while Hashim went to speak to three friends sitting outside. When the appellant came out of the shop Hashim was not there. The three told the appellant that Hashim had borrowed a motorcycle from one of them and gone off for a while. The appellant sat with the three and waited for the return of Hashim. Hashim returned 1 hours later. The three gave evidence that when Hashim returned he had the bag with him. The appellant and Hashim then walked back to the appellant's house. On the way Hashim asked the appellant to hold the bag as Hashim wanted to urinate. The appellant was arrested while he was holding the bag.
50. The trial judge in considering the evidence directed himself as follows:
Was the accused telling the truth? Were the three people sitting under the ketapang tree telling the truth? It is purely a question for the cour to evaluate the evidence and make a finding on who are telling the truth and who are not telling the truth.
Having thus directed himself the trial judge, not satisfied that the defence witnesses were telling the truth, convicted the appellant of trafficking in cannabis.
51. The Supreme Court was not happy with this direction. In the words of Mohamed Azmi SCJ:
In this case, we found that the learned trial judge offered practically no reason why the defence, notwithstanding its falsity and unconvincing nature, had failed to cast reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, other than to state by way of lip service the duty placed by the law on the defence to earn an acquittal.
It is well-established principle of Malaysian criminal law that the general burden of proof lies throughout the trial on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused for the offence with which he is charged. There is no similar burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence. He is presumed innocent until proven guilty. To earn an acquittal, his duty is merely to cast a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In the course of the prosecution case, the prosecution may of course rely on available statutory presumptions to prove one or more of the essential ingredients of the charge. When that occurs, the particular burden of proof as opposed to the general burden, shifts to the defence to rebut such resumptions on the balance of probabilities which from the defence point of view is heavier than the burden of casting a reasonable doubt, but it is certainly lighter than the burden of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt.
...
To earn an acquittal, the court may not be convinced of the truth of the defence story or version. Raising a reasonable doubt in the guilt of the accused will suffice. It is not, however, wrong for the court to be convinced that the defence version is true, in which case the court must order an acquittal. In appropriate cases it is also not wrong for the court to conclude that the defence story is false or not convincing, but in that instance, the court must not convict until it asks a further question, that even if the court does not accept or believe the defence explanation, does it nevertheless raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt? < Emphasis added. > 
52. It is to be noted that Mohamed Azmi SCJ in reiterating the principle that in a criminal trial the prosecution had to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt accepted that where a statutory presumption was available to prove one or more ingredients of the charge ""the particular burden of proof as opposed to the general burden, shifts to the defence to rebut such presumption on the balance of probabilities"". It will be useful to explore why the Supreme Court while accepting that the burden was on the defence to rebut a presumption on a balance of probabilities nevertheless set aside the conviction of the appellant even though the trial judge had on balance rejected the defence version.
53. In that case, the appellant when he was arrested was in possession of the drugs. The presumptions under the act that he knew the nature of the drugs and that he was trafficking in the drugs therefore arose. But that was the limit of the presumptions. In that case, the accused had claimed that he was only in transient possession of the drugs while Hashim was urinating. He had called witnesses who had testified that Hashim had gone off on the motorcycle and returned carrying the bag. The trial judge had been content to dismiss that evidence as being unlikely to be true. He had not gone further and asked himself the question: ""Although I do not believe their story nevertheless is it reasonably possible that it was Hashim and not the accused who had all along been in possession of the bag?"" It was his failure to ask this question that prompted the sharp criticism of the Supreme Court. It would appear that from the fact that the accused was in possession of the bag at the time of his arrest the trial judge not only presumed that the accused knew the nature of the contents of the bag but also presumed that the accused was in continuous possession of the bag - hence his rejection of the evidence of the defence witnesses on the basis of the balance of probabilities without considering the further question of whether the defence version that the bag was only in the temporary possession of the accused could reasonably be true.
54. There was another aspect of the judgment that the Supreme Court criticised.
The trial judge had found as a fact that the defence had not rebutted the statutory presumption contained in s 37(d) on a balance of probabilities and had then gone on to say: ""It follows that the presumption of s 37(da) is also not rebutted"". The Supreme Court disagreed. It did not follow that the presumption of trafficking was not rebutted merely because the defence failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. Whilst this part of the judgment of the Supreme Court has no particular relevance to the present case it is to be noted that the Supreme Court again spoke of the defence rebutting a statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities. At page 172 of the judgment, Mohamed Azmi SCJ said:
In our opinion... it is incumbent for the court to consider whether on the balance of probabilities, the evidence of the defence has rebutted the statutory presumption of trafficking under s 37(da) as a separate exercise even though the court is satisfied on balance that the presumption of possession under s 37(d) has not been rebutted. < Emphasis added. > 
55. PP v Kang Ho Soh (4) was a decision of Shankar J of the High Court of Malaysia. The accused there was driving a car when the police, acting on information received, stopped his car. The police opened the boot of the car and a large quantity of heroin was found. The car did not belong to the accused. He had borrowed it from his brother-in-law that day. As the drugs were not concealed in any specially constructed compartment of the car the presumption under s 37(h) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 that drugs found concealed in any specially constructed compartment of a vehicle are deemed to be concealed with the knowledge of the person in charge of the vehicle was not available. Nor was any other statutory presumption available to assist the prosecution prove that the accused was in possession of and knew the nature of the drugs found in the boot of the car. If the prosecution proved by evidence aliunde that the accused was in possession of the drugs found, then the presumptions under ss 37(d) and 37(da) would arise and the accused would be presumed to know that the drug was heroin and as the quantity was in excess of 15g it would be presumed that the accused was trafficking in the drug. Shankar J held that there was a prima facie case that the accused was in possession of the drugs and called on the defence.
56. At the close of the case Shankar J was not impressed with the evidence of the accused. He did not consider the accused to be a truthful person and he suspected that the accused was in fact involved in the goings-on that day. Shankar J however went on to say:
But before we take a man's life we must be as absolutely sure as the law will allow that we have got the right man for the right reason.
In the present case the required standard of proof has not been discharged to my satisfaction. The accused is therefore acquitted and discharged. Dr Myint Soe relied on the above passage in the judgment of Shankar J as evidencing that the accused in that case had successfully rebutted the statutory presumptions by creating only a reasonable doubt.
57. In PP v Kang Ho Soh, the statutory presumption under s 37(d) would arise only if the prosecution could prove that the accused was in possession of the items found in the boot of the car. At the close of the case, although Shankar J did not believe the accused's disclaimer of possession, he nevertheless had doubts about this. That being so, the prosecution had not discharged its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the items in the boot. As possession was not proved the presumptions under s 37(d) and (da) would not arise and consequently neither would the question of rebutting the presumption on a balance of probability. PP v Kang Ho Soh was therefore not a case where a statutory presumption was rebutted on the basis of a reasonable doubt and was of no assistance to the defence.
58. Yusoff bin Kassim v PP (5) was a decision of the Supreme Court of Malaysia. In that case the appellant was carrying the bag in which the drugs were found. The presumption under the Act therefore arose. The Supreme Court set aside the conviction of the appellant. In setting aside the conviction, Edgar Joseph Jr SCJ said that the Supreme Court was:
... amply satisfied that the case against the appellant was not proved with that certainty which is necessary in order to justify a verdict of guilty. On the face of it this passage does appear to support Dr Myint Soe's submission. But one needs to examine the case in greater detail.
59. In that case the accused had arrived on foot at the Padang Besar Customs Check Point from Pekan Siam. He placed a brown bag he was carrying on the customs counter. The bag was found to contain cannabis. On those facts the trial judge ruled that the presumptions under s 37(d) and (da) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 arose, their combined effect being that it was presumed, until the contrary was proved, that the appellant knew of the presence of cannabis in the bag, knew of its nature, and by reason of its weight exceeding the statutory minimum of 200g, was a trafficker in the same. He therefore called on the defence.
60. The accused, in his defence, said that he was a petty trader plying his trade in Kampong Gajah. He bought his supplies periodically from Pekan Siam as goods were cheaper there. On that day he was carrying a green travelling bag and was queuing up at the customs checkpoint when he met Dollah, a Thai citizen he knew. Dollah handed to him his brown travelling bag and asked him to hold it while Dollah went to have his border pass stamped. The appellant obliged and on arrival at the head of the queue placed both bags on the customs counter for inspection. When asked by a Malay customs officer about the contents of the brown bag the appellant pointed to Dollah who was behind in the queue whereupon Dollah ran off and escaped whilst the accused was arrested.
61. The Malay customs officer in his evidence maintained that the appellant had only one bag with him - the brown bag. But another customs officer admitted under cross-examination that there were two bags - one brown and one green. The trial judge in his judgment referred only to the evidence of the Malay customs officer. He made no mention at all of the other customs officer's evidence which was consistent with the accused's evidence, that he had two bags with him.
62. The Supreme Court considered this failure of the trial judge to refer to the other customs officers' evidence to be a glaring omission. They held that had the trial judge taken that evidence into consideration he might well have considered the appellant's evidence that he was carrying the brown bag with its offending contents at the behest of Dollah in a more favourable light. It was for those reasons that the Supreme Court set aside the conviction of the appellant. The case does not, in my view, contradict the principle that where a statutory presumption arises the burden of rebutting the presumption is on the defence and is on the balance of probabilities.
63. One other case relied on by Dr Myint Soe was Ramond Selva Clement v PP (6). That case too, in my view, is of no assistance in advancing Dr Myint Soe's submission. To the contrary, the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case specifically stated that: ""by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), the appellant's act of possession was presumed to constitute both the actus reus and the mens rea of trafficking and the onus then was upon the appellant to negative this on the balance of probabilities"".
64. The existence of a statutory presumption does not dislodge the general burden on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The purpose of a statutory presumption is merely to ease the burden on the prosecution in proving the existence of certain facts. Thus the prosecution may prove, for instance, that a person was in possession of white powder. It may also prove that the white power was heroin. But to prove that the person in possession of the white powder knew that the powder was heroin would often be a very difficult task for the prosecution. To ease this difficulty, the legislat re has, in certain limited circumstances, provided statutory presumptions. Where such a presumption is invoked the onus of rebutting that particular presumption shifts to the defence and it is accepted law that that onus is discharged on a balance of probabilities. Where a person found in possession of (say) heroin claims that he did not know it was heroin that claim may well be true but because the onus is on the defence the mere possibility that the claim may be true is not sufficient, more is required: the court must be satisfied that the claim is more likely to be true than not.
65. Dr Myint Soe cited numerous cases where the courts have accepted the plea of the accused that he was an innocent custodian of the drug and has pointed out that in some of these case, there was little or no other evidence to support the claim of innocence. He has also cited numerous other cases where the courts have found persons in possession of drugs to be guilty of trafficking and pointed out that the evidence against the accused in those cases was overwhelming. But these cases establish no general principles. They are no more than instances where on the facts surrounding those cases the court, on balance, had believed or disbelieved as the case may be the claim that the accused was not aware that the goods he had in his possession was drugs. There is therefore little purpose in reviewing these cases. The reasons given by a judge in arriving at conclusions of facts are inevitably reasons peculiar to the facts of the case then being considered by the judge. It is pointless citing such cases as precedents.
66. In the present case, the difficulty faced by Shankar J in PP v Kang Ho Soh as to whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of what was in the boot of the car did not arise. It was not in dispute here that the accused was in possession of the bag in which the drugs were hidden. As the accused was in possession of the bag a presumption arose under s 18(1)(a) that he was in possession of the drugs contained in the bag and by s 18(2) of the Act a further presumption arose that he knew the nature of the drug, namely, that it was diamorphine. It was up to the accused to rebut these presumptions on a balance of probabilities.
67. Whether innocent or guilty, the invariable defence of a person in whose possession controlled drugs are found is: ""I did not know it contained drugs"", and the task of the judge is to sort out, as best he can and within the bounds of accepted legal principles, the innocent from the guilty. This is a difficult and demanding task for the judge, the more so because the penalty is often the mandatory one of death. There is no room for mistakes.
It is therefore necessary for the judge to review the evidence as painstakingly and honestly as he can and, equally as important, it is necessary for the prosecution to investigate the case as honestly and as thoroughly as is possible and in prosecuting the case refrain from withholding material evidence. This requires that the prosecution makes available to the defence all relevant material in its possession at the earliest convenient time so that the accused can adequately prepare his defence.
68. In this case, the long statement of the accused was given to the defence only shortly before the trial commenced and the statement made by the accused to CCO Koh was disclosed only on the morning of the trial. Needless to say, such short notice can be a great handicap to defence counsel and can lead to the hearing of the trial being unnecessarily prolonged. I hasten to say though that the delay in letting the defence have copies of these documents was not attributable to the learned DPP who conducted the prosecution. He did not have the conduct of this case at the time of the preliminary inquiry. He made the long statement available to the defence as soon as he could. In respect of the entry in CCO Koh's pocket book, the learned DPP himself became aware of the entry only the week before the trial started.
69. The IO was diligent in taking a full statement from the accused. But he did not ascertain from the customs officers all that transpired from the time the accused was arrested to the time he took custody of the accused. The accused's first reactions when arrested with drugs in his control is often very important. In this case for instance if the fac that the accused had from the beginning maintained that he was a courier of precious stones for Maung Maung had not been disclosed, I could well have drawn an inference adverse to the accused when the accused failed to mention those facts in his s 122(6) statement. The IO hinted that he did not interrogate the customs officers at the scene intensively because the Customs Department is a separate investigative agency and had its own intelligence and departmental policies. In my view that is no reason why when the CNB takes over an investigation it should not demand to know in detail everything relevant that transpired whilst another agency was investigating the case. Similarly, knowing that hearing dates for trials come up very fast, the IO could, instead of just waiting for the response from the Thai police, have done more checking on the veracity of the accused's statements particularly in tracing the records of Thai Airways and Silkair.
70. I would add that defence counsel too have a very high responsibility cast on them. They will have to question the accused exhaustively and be thoroughly familiar not only with the facts of the case but also, in cases such as this, with the accused's personal background. In some cases accused persons are master criminals but in other cases they could be naive and simple-minded and made use of by drug syndicates because of those qualities. In the latter cases, they cannot be expected to volunteer to counsel all facts relevant to their defence. Often they may not appreciate how important a piece of evidence is. Defence counsel will have to probe, much like the IO does, and extract relevant information.
71. In this regard, the two counsel assigned to defend the accused have done a very good job. Miss Lim has done much of what the IO should have done. She took the initiative and wrote to Thai Airways in Singapore to obtain details of the flight. These details confirmed the accused's story that he and another person had travelled to Hatyai on a ticket bought by Maung Maung. It even gave Maung Maung's address and telephone number. If these details had not been produced, the prosecution could have taken the position (and indeed did for a while) that the entire story of Maung Maung, of Maung Maung being a gem trader and the accused being a courier of gems for Maung Maung was a fabrication. Because Miss Lim unearthed evidence from Thai Airways that Maung Maung had booked the ticket on which the accused flew to Hatyai the prosecution could no longer challenge the existence of Maung Maung and could no longer challenge the assertion of the accused that he was a courier for Maung Maung. What the prosecution now wanted the court to find was that the story of the accused that he believed that he was carrying gems was a fabrication and that in truth he knew or ought to have known that he was carrying heroin for Maung Maung.
72. I drew no adverse inference against the accused by reason of the fact that he said nothing in his s 122(6) statement. Immediately before the statement the accused had told CCO Koh that he was carrying precious stones to Cebu for Maung Maung. Shortly after the s 122(6) statement, the accused had given the IO a detailed account of how he met Maung Maung and how he agreed to be a courier of precious stones for Maung Maung. I am therefore inclined to believe that in the early hours of the morning when the s 122(6) statement was recorded there was some miscommunication about the need to give a statement then and there. In this connection, the evidence of the interpreter, Miss Malar Swe is that she did not interpret the caution sentence by sentence. Instead, she read the entire caution and then explained to the accused what she thought the caution meant. This is not quite satisfactory. It is important that interpreters translate as exactly as possible what the caution states. If they do not there will be the problem of remembering exactly what was said to the accused. They should also at the time the s 122(6) statement is being recorded refrain from having general conversations with the accused.
73. The statement allegedly made by the accused that was in the pocket book of CCO Koh also had some inherent difficulties. Although the learned DPP sought to submit otherwise it was apparent to me that the accused had only a very limited knowledge of English. That alone made it undesirable to place any weight to the statements allegedly made to CCO Koh. In addition to the difficulties of language the statement was recorded in the pocket book long after the conversation took place. The piece of paper on which CCO Koh said he jotted down points in the conversation was destroyed. Some of the words used in the statement could not have come from the accused. They were CCO Koh's own creation. In fairness to CCO Koh it must be noted that he did not realise that the entries in his pocket book would be adduced in court as evidence. In his mind, he was only gathering general intelligence on the drugs business for departmental purposes. I found it difficult to accept CCO Koh's evidence that plainclothes officers in the customs department issued with pocket books are not expected to make contemporaneous or near contemporaneous entries in their pocket books but do so very much later. In the courts we listen to witnesses on a daily basis and it is common experience that without referring to the notes of proceedings it is often very difficult to recall accurately the evidence of a witness. Bearing in mind the fallibility of human memory, very little weight can be given to the details of any conversation with an accused person leave alone a conversation over a period of 2 hours when that conversation is only reduced into writing many hours later.
74. There were some aspects of the account given by the accused that did not appear to gel. On the accused's evidence, had it not been for the accidental intervention of the airport staff who assisted him he would not have picked up the bag. It seemed odd that such a vast quantity of heroin could have been checked in only to Singapore when the accused was told that in Singapore he need not worry about the bag as the airline staff would ensure that it is placed on the flight to Cebu. But there can be all kinds of explanations for this: it may be that the accused misunderstood Yusoof or it may be that Yusoof or the airline staff at Hatyai did not check in the bag at Hatyai properly (bearing in mind that the flight was on a ""RQ"" basis) or it may even be that the bag was in fact destined for Singapore. But all that is speculation. The amount of heroin in the bag was considerable and the syndicate using the accused may have had a very sophisticated strategy to achieve its objective. The simple fact is that if the accused knew that he had to pick up the bag in Singapore before checking in for the flight to Cebu there appears little or no reason for him not to say so and instead invent a story about a staff member who happened to tell him that he had to pick up the bag in Singapore. I would note that the accused had in his long statement to the IO told the IO about the role the staff member played.
75. The learned DPP in his lengthy submission drew attention to various other aspects of the case which he submitted affected the credibility of the accused and which indicated guilt. I reviewed his submissions and the evidence in this case very carefully. I accepted the accused's account of his educational background and of why he was in Thailand. I accepted his account of how he met Maung Maung and how he got involved in carrying this bag from Bangkok to Cebu. I accepted the accused's evidence that when Maung Maung asked him to smuggle precious stones he believed Maung Maung. I also accepted the accused's evidence that Maung Maung was a known moneychanger and gem trader operating in the vicinity of the Haroon mosque in Bangkok. The accused proved to my satisfaction that he believed that he was smuggling precious stones into Cebu. I was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused did not know that the bag in fact contained heroin. I therefore acquitted and discharged the accused.",1995-03-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

    ______________

    I. INTRODUCTION

    1.  Turbo Top is a subsidiary of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.

    2.  Turbo Top owns the site at the junction of Queen’s Road Central and Garden Road. Cheung Kong Center (CKC) (a commercial tower) now occupies the site. In addition, there is a public open space in front of CKC; a car park of 1,046 parking spaces (800 for public and 246 for private use); a public garden at the car park’s deck level; a public toilet; and a small commercial space of about 648 sq m used as a fast food outlet.  The development originally included a post office. But the space occupied by the latter is now used by a Government office.    

    3.  The site formerly comprised the Hong Kong Hilton, Beaconsfield House (where Government offices were situated) and the Garden Road Car Park (which had 800 public car parking spaces). 

    4.  Turbo Top acquired the site in November 1996 under an Agreement with Government.  It was a special condition of the Agreement that Turbo Top maintain a public car park of at least 800 spaces at the site.  It was also a special condition of the Agreement that Turbo Top erect a development at the site having a specified minimum GFA, of which not more than 680 sq m could be for retail purposes.

    5.  Turbo Top now challenges amendments proposed by the Town Planning Board (TPB) to the Outline Zoning Plan (OZP) for the area where the site is situated. 

    6.  Turbo Top objected to the amendments when they were gazetted.  On 21 January 2011 TPB rejected Turbo Top’s objections. 

    7.  The TPB then further considered the OZP amendments as a result of representations by members of the public (including Turbo Top).  As a result, on 15 April 2011 the TPB accepted some representations (including some by Turbo Top).

    8.  On 13 May 2011 the TPB of its own decided to vary the proposed OZP amendments yet further.

    9.  Turbo Top contends that the TPB’s decisions of 21 January, 15 April and 13 May 2011 (respectively, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions) were invalid for various reasons.  By HCAL 23 Turbo Top attacked the 1st decision.  By HCAL 52 Turbo Top attacked the 2nd and 3rd decisions.  Since both sets of proceedings are inter-related, they have been heard together.  

    10.  Turbo Top’s main complaint is that, in proposing to amend the relevant OZP, the TPB exceeded its jurisdiction.  The TPB (Turbo Top says) is only authorised by the Town Planning Ordinance (Cap.131) (TPO) to prepare and approve plans for the layout of areas of Hong Kong.  According to the long title to the TPO, the TPB should do this in order “[t]o promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community”. 

    11.  What the TPB cannot do (Turbo Top suggests) is impose restrictions on a specific building (such as CKC) within an area.  That (Turbo Top complains) is to usurp the power of the Building Authority which regulates what can or what cannot be done in relation to a given building. 

    12.  The TPB’s powers (Turbo Top argues) are merely “broad brush” in relation to areas of Hong Kong.  The TPB’s powers do not allow the TPB to engage in the “micro-management” of a building by the preparation and approval of plans which state what can or should not be done in a building.

    II. BACKGROUND

    13.  Since 1981 the site has had 2 zonings.  About 0.64 ha is zoned G/IC, while the remaining 0.32 ha is zoned C.

    14.  Cheung Kong submitted a proposal for the comprehensive re-development of the site in 1994.  ExCo agreed to the re-development scheme in 1995.  The Lands Department then negotiated terms of exchange. 

    15.  A pre-requisite for implementation of the scheme was the obtaining by Cheung Kong of the TPB’s approval for the redevelopment pursuant to TPO s. 16.  Cheung Kong did not regard it as strictly necessary from a legal standpoint to apply for TPB approval. Nonetheless, for “public relations” reasons, it agreed to seek TPB approval as required by Government.

    16.  A selling-point of Cheung Kong’s planning application was that the re-development would include re-provisioning of the 800 public parking spaces that would be lost through demolition of the Garden Road Car Park. 

    17.  The re-provisioning was a matter of concern to Government at the time.  This is evident, for instance, from comments on the scheme by the Project Manager (Hong Kong & Islands) (PM(HK&I)).  The latter stressed that “[t]he existing public facilities within the redevelopment site such as public car park, public toilets, Post Office etc. must be adequately re-provisioned so as to safeguard the interest of the public”.

    18.  In October 1995 the TPB notified Cheung Kong that its TPO s.16 application had been approved.  It was a condition of approval that “the provision, management and maintenance of the public car park including temporary re-provisioning arrangements” be to “the satisfaction of the Commissioner for Transport or of the [TPB]”.

    19.  In November 1996 Government and Turbo Top entered into the Agreement and Conditions of Exchange whereby the latter was granted the site as one lot (not 2 distinct lots as formerly). 

    20.  In June 2008 Turbo Top applied to the Lands Department for modification of its lease conditions to allow 78 public parking spaces (located in the C zone) to be converted to a supermarket. 

    21.  In support, Turbo Top commissioned a car park study.  That showed that peak utilisation of the public parking spaces was only 68.3%.  Nearby car parking (such as at Citibank Tower and Murray Road) also revealed low utilisation rates.

    22.  In July 2010 the Transport Department indicated that it had no objection to the proposed conversion of 78 spaces to a supermarket.

    23.  Meanwhile, in June 2010, the TPB’s Metro Planning Committee proposed re-zoning the site from C and G/IC to C(1).  This would be done “to reflect the existing development on the site”.

    24.  The proposed OZP amendments were gazetted on 16 July 2010. 

    25.  The draft OZP amendments stated in “Remarks” within the “Commercial” section of the Schedule of Uses:-

    
        “On land designated ‘Commercial (1)’, no new development, or addition, alteration and/or modification to or redevelopment of an existing building shall result in a total development and/or redevelopment in excess of a maximum non-domestic gross floor area of 144,840 m2, of which a gross floor area of not more than 680 m2 shall be used for retail purpose, and gross floor areas of not less than 700 m2 and 25,000 m2 shall be used respectively for Government facilities and public car park with a minimum of 800 public car parking spaces. Public open space of not less than 5,200 m2 shall be provided.”
    

    26.  On 16 September 2010 Turbo Top submitted representations (referred to as “R7”) objecting to the OZP amendments affecting the site.  Other parties also made representations.

    27.  To assist the TPB when considering the representations, the Planning Department prepared Paper No. 8703.  On R7, that paper stated:-

    
        “TD [Transport Department] has advised that taking onto account the imminent developments/redevelopments in Central, which include a number of private developments alongside Queen’s Road Central without public car parking spaces, it would be prudent to keep 78 car parking spaces at Cheung Kong Center. It should be noted that what R7 asks for is deleting the stipulation of the requirements relating to the public car park in the Notes, rather than just the 78 car parking spaces. The implication of such proposal is far more significant.”
    

    28.  At its 21 January 2011 meeting, the TPB by the 1st decision rejected R7.  Its reasons for so doing were as follows:-

    
        “(a) the rezoning of the Cheung Kong Center site to C(1) was to reflect the completed development of the site. The stipulation of the specific GFA restrictions in the Notes followed the entitlements under the lease which reflected the development scheme approved by the Board. There was provision under the Notes for minor relaxation of the GFA restrictions on application to the Board.

        (b) the public car park was for the re-provisioning of the ex-Garden Road Multi-storey Car Park, and the government facilities provided within the site are for the re-provisioning of similar facilities in the ex-Beaconsfield House, continuous provision of these facilities should be ensured by imposing specific control in the Notes of the ‘C(1)’ zone; and

        (c) the OZP was a small-scale plan and it was intended to illustrate only the broad land use zonings. Since there was provision in the covering Notes of the OZP allowing boundaries between zones be subject to minor adjustments, realignment of the boundary to follow the lot boundary was considered not necessary.”
    

    29.  Note that there is a slight discrepancy between the boundary of the area zoned C(1) in the draft amended OZP and the actual site boundary.  Reason (c) concerned Turbo Top’s request that the OZP zoning boundary be re-drawn to conform with the site’s actual boundary.

    30.  On 18 February 2011 the TPB gazetted a revision to its proposed amendments to the OZP pursuant to TPO s. 6B(8).  The TPB put forward the revision in response to certain representations (identified as “R2” and “R5”) on the proposed OZP amendments.

    31.  The revision was supposed to make clear the planning intention behind the amendments.  Thus, the revision would expressly state that the C(1) zone was intended primarily for comprehensive development/ redevelopment for office use and provision of public car park, Government facilities and public open space, with supporting shop, services and eating place. 

    32.  On 10 March 2011 Turbo Top objected to the gazetted revision without prejudice to its previous representations.

    33.  At its 15 April 2011 meeting, the TPB by the 2nd decision rejected Turbo Top’s further representation (known as “F1”) against the inclusion of a statement of planning intention.  Instead, the TPB justified the revision to the OZP thus:-

    
        “To address the concern of some representers and commenter as well as the public on possible loss of Government, Institution or Community facilities and public open space due to the rezoning amendment of the CKC site from ‘Government Institution or Community’ and ‘Commercial’ to ‘C(1)’, it is considered appropriate to explain clearly the history/rationale of the rezoning and the planning control imposed on the site by revising the relevant parts of the Notes and ES [Explanatory Statement] to clearly set out that the planning intention of the ‘C(1)’ zone which is primarily for office use and the provision of public car park, government facilities and public open space, with supporting shop, services and eating place.”
    

    34.  At its 15 April meeting, the TPB by the 2nd decision also heeded some of Turbo Top’s objections. 

    35.  It decided to delete the retail GFA restriction which it had sought to impose on the site.  It did so to make the proposed amendments to the OZP insofar as the site was concerned “consistent with the development restrictions imposed on the IFC site”.

    36.  It decided to retain the requirement of 800 parking spaces, but it resolved “to incorporate provision for minor relaxation of the restriction on the minimum number of public car parking spaces on application for the C(1) zone”. 

    37.  Having made its 2nd decision, the TPB requested its Secretariat “to work out the amendments to the Notes and Explanatory Statement of the OZP for the Board’s further consideration”.   

    38.  On 13 May the TPB by the 3rd decision deleted the restriction of a minimum GFA for car parking spaces at the site.  According to the minutes of the meeting, the deletion was prompted by an observation of the TPB’s Secretary (Ms. Ophelia Wong).  She had pointed out that:-

    
        “for other OZPs, the general practice was to stipulate car parking requirement for particular sites either in terms of minimum GFA or minimum number of parking spaces. For consistency, it was therefore suggested that the restriction on the provision of a minimum GFA for public car parking for the C(1) zone be deleted.”
    

    39.  Turbo Top was informed of the 3rd decision on 18 May 2011.  Until then it had no idea that the TPB was considering the deletion of the minimum GFA for car parking spaces at the site.

    40.  Turbo Top’s principal complaints are as follows:-

    
        (1) The 1st decision and, consequently, amendments to the 1st decision made by the 2nd and 3rd decisions were ultra vires. That was because the decisions constituted impermissible micro-managing by the TPB of the uses of a specific building (CKC), rather than an area.

        (2) The proposed OZP amendments (as proposed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions) are inconsistent.

        (3) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions were based on irrelevant or erroneous considerations.

        (4) The 3rd decision was vitiated by procedural irregularity.

        (5) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions are arbitrary and discriminatory.
    

    III. DISCUSSION

    A. Preliminary

    41.  Before examining Turbo Top’s complaints, I should deal with a preliminary point raised by Mr Johnny Mok SC (appearing for the TPB). 

    42.  Mr Mok submits that HCAL 23 was premature.  That is because, when HCAL 23 was commenced, the TPB had yet to consider Turbo Top’s further representation (F1) at its 15 April 2011 meeting.  The 2nd decision, which was the outcome of that meeting, accepted some of Turbo Top’s arguments and varied the OZP amendments originally proposed. 

    43.  According to Mr Mok, this suggests that Turbo Top should have waited for the outcome of the 15 April meeting before initiating a judicial review.

    44.  But, as I indicated to Mr Mok and Mr Benjamin Yu SC (appearing for Turbo Top), I do not think that I should dismiss HCAL 23 on the purely technical ground of being premature. There is little point in so doing.

    45.  I doubt that the application was premature, since it seems to me that as of 21 January 2011 the TPB had firmly decided to revise the zoning of the site and impose restrictions on what could be done there.  The precise nature of those restrictions may have been varied later in response to other representations (for instance, R2 and R5, as opposed to R7). But the variations were in effect “fine-tuning” of the substantive decision already taken to reject R7.

    46.  I do not have to determine the question conclusively. 

    47.  By any reckoning, even in considering HCAL 53, I would have to grapple with at least the key issues raised by HCAL No. 23.  HCAL No. 23 queries the 1st decision.  HCAL 53 queries the 2nd and 3rd decisions.  Even if HCAL 23 were premature, I would still have to assess the essential legality of the 1st decision (or what survives of it), if only to arrive at conclusions on the vires of the 2nd and 3rd decisions. 

    48.  It follows that it would be wrong to dismiss HCAL 23 off-hand.  I need to deal with the thrust of the argument there at the very least.  It would accordingly be an arid exercise to spend significant time on the niceties of whether, when HCAL 23 of 2011 was initiated, the 1st decision had definitely rejected R7 or only reflected a provisional view on R7’s merits.

    49.  I shall proceed then on the foregoing basis.  In so doing, I am mindful that I cannot ignore subsequent events.  I accept Mr Mok’s caveat that I ought in any event to focus on what now remains of the 1st decision, namely, the re-zoning of the site from distinct G/IC and C zones to a C(1) zone and the imposition of a requirement (subject to minor relaxation upon application) that there be at least 800 public parking spaces in the site.  It would be academic to consider those elements of the 1st decision which the 2nd and 3rd decisions have superseded.

    B. Complaint (1): Impermissible micro-managing by TPB

    50.  Mr Yu’s submission begins with the long title to the TPO.  That expresses the TPO’s purpose:-

    
        “To promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community by making provision for the systematic preparation and approval of plans for the lay-out of areas of Hong Kong as well as for the types of building suitable for erection therein and for the preparation and approval of plans for areas within which permission is required for development.”
    

    51.  The long title is echoed in TPO s. 3(1)(a). That confers on the TPB a power to “undertake the systematic preparation of draft plans for the lay-out of such areas of Hong Kong as the Chief Executive may direct, as well as the types of building suitable for erection therein”. Such power is to be exercised “[w]ith a view to the promotion of the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community”.

    52.  TPO s. 4(1) specifies how the TPB may exercise the power conferred by s. 3(1)(a) in respect of layout plans.  TPO s. 4(1) provides:-

    
        “The Board’s draft plans prepared under section 3(1)(a) for the layout of any such area may show or make provision for:-

		
			(a) streets, railways and other main communications;

			(b) zones or districts set apart for use for residential, commercial, industiral or other specified uses;

			(c) reserves for Government, institution or community purposes;

			(d) parks, recreation grounds and similar open spaces;

			(e) zones or districts set apart for undetermined uses;

			(f) comprehensive development areas;

			(g) country parks, coastal protection areas, sites of specific interest, green belts or other specified uses that promote conservation or protection of the environment;

			(h) zones or districts set apart for use for village type development, agriculture or other specified rural uses;

			(i) zones or districts set apart for use for open storage,
		

        and any matter whatsoever may be shown or provided for or specified in or in respect of the plans by means of such diagrams, illustrations, notes or descriptive matter as the Board thinks appropriate; and any such diagrams, illustrations, notes and descriptive matters shall be part of the plans.”
    

    53.  TPO s. 4(1)(f) was added in 1988.  TPO ss. 4(1)(g)-(i) were added in 1991.

    54.  The words beginning “and any matter whatsoever ...” in s. 4(1) were added in 1974.  I shall refer to those words as “the s. 4(1) proviso”.  They were added to bring s. 4(1) in line with what had been thought to be the position prior to the High Court’s judgment in Singway v. AG [1974] HKLR 275. 

    55.  Before Singway, it had been assumed that ss. 4(1)(a)-(e) were illustrative, not exhaustive, of what the TPB could make provision for in a layout plan.  But Singway held otherwise.  Applying the maxim that the expression of a specific matter implied the exclusion of any other matter (expressio unius, exclusio alterius), Leonard J read the list in paras. (a)-(e) as an exhaustive statement of what the TPB could designate in a layout plan.

    56.  Had the TPO not been amended by the s. 4(1) proviso, Singway would have invalidated numerous OZPs, all based on a mistaken assumption as to the width of the power in s. 4(1).  See Explanatory Memorandum to the Town Planning (Amendment and Validation) Bill of 1974.

    57.  I pause to note that TPO s. 16 was also a response to Singway.  That was enacted to confer flexibility.  It enabled the TPB, where there is provision in an OZP for relaxation of a restriction, to grant permission upon application for the restriction to be relaxed in a particular case.

    58.  Mr Yu infers from the long-title and TPO ss. 3(1)(a) and 4(1) that the TPB’s approach in drawing up plans must be “broad brush”.  The TPB’s statutory powers can only be exercised in relation to areas or in respect of the types of buildings in particular areas.  The TPB cannot engage in “spot-zoning” by specifying some restriction affecting only a particular building within a given area.  If the TPB were to engage in such, it would be encroaching (Mr Yu says) upon the role of the Building Authority.

    59.  Mr Yu supports his reading of the TPB’s limited power with dicta from a trilogy of cases: Crozet v. AG [1973-76] HKC 97; AG v. CC Tse (Estate) Ltd. [1982] HKLR 7 (CA); and Wing On Ltd. v. Building Authority (1996) 6 HKPLR 432 (CA).

    60.  In Crozet (decided before Singway), Briggs CJ held that the TPB had power to specify the plot ratio for buildings in an area.  He observed that the TPB’s powers were widely drawn in the TPO and should be liberally construed.  But he cautioned (at 100E) that the TPB’s powers under the TPO “do not include such matters as the proportions, height and design of buildings”.  That was because the latter matters had been “left to the Building Authority under the Buildings Ordinance”.

    61.  In CC Tse (decided after Singway), it was argued that the TPB had no power under s. 3(1) to make provision for “the types of building suitable for erection” in a particular area otherwise than by reference to one or more of the matters listed in the paragraphs of s. 4(1).  Since s. 4(1) did not specifically mention plot ratio, it was submitted that the TPB could not regulate the plot ratios of buildings in a particular area. In the alternative, it was argued that plot ratio could not be equated with the expression “types of building” in s. 3(1). 

    62.  At first instance, CC Tse had successfully challenged the validity of the plot ratio restriction in the relevant OZP.  In the course of his judgment, Liu J suggested that “types of buildings” meant “classes of buildings sharing common characteristics”.

    63.  The Court of Appeal rejected the submission that the general power to make provision for “types of building” in s. 3(1) was constrained by the specific list in s. 4(1) dealing with layout plans. 

    64.  In considering the Applicant’s alternative argument, Cons JA stated (at 14H ff.):-

    
        “It seems to me that what is done inside a building is not a satisfactory characteristic for determining the type of that building, which is more a question of design. This could be introduced into [Liu J’s] definition by the addition of the word ‘architectural’, so that it would then read: ‘“types of building” means classes of building sharing common architectural characteristics’, or to put it in another way, when we wish to know into which type or types of building a particular building falls, we must look at the building as a building.

        The question then is whether plot ratio is an architectural characteristic. In my opinion it is. As I understand the term it means the relationship between the floor area of the building and the ground on which it could be built....

        It is thus not a rigid feature. It is a matter of proportion which leaves the architect considerable latitude, in theory at least. He may design a la pancake or a la pencil, or somewhere between those two extremes. Nonetheless, the resultant buildings will all have something in common. All will have the same relationship of floor area to site area. That is something which relates to the building as a building and in my view is an architectural characteristic as much as an auditorium or a garage. It may not be as readily discernible to the untrained eye, but it is there all the same, and its effect would, I feel confident, be immediately discernible to anyone were he faced with buildings of plot ratios as widely varied as those we are concerned with here.”
    

    65.  Cons JA obliquely contrasted (at 15F) the powers of the Building Authority under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO) with those of the TPB under the TPO:-

    
        “A further objection was that the legislation cannot have intended the Town Planning Ordinance to deal with a matter of this kind because it is fully and specifically dealt with in regulations made under the Buildings Ordinance Cap. 123; the Town Planning Ordinance was meant to give guidance only of the ‘broad brush’ kind, not to deal with fine particulars of this nature.

        It seems to me however that the restriction imposed in the present instance is of the ‘broad brush’ kind...”
    

    66.  Having rejected the Applicant’s main and alternative arguments, Cons JA did not deal with the Government’s points on the scope of the TPB’s power under TPO s. 4(1).  But Cons JA remarked (at 15F):-

    
        “The Attorney General had two or perhaps three further arguments based upon the last paragraph of section 4(1) [that is, the s. 4(1) proviso] or upon Crozet’s case HCMP 409/73, unreported. I venture to think that all were doubtful starters but express no concluded opinion....”
    

    67.  In Wing On, the Court of Appeal held that the Building Authority retained a discretion under BO s. 16 to approve building plans even where they contravened an OZP.  In the course of a concurring judgment, Godfrey JA approved (at 438D ff) the following passage from the Building Appeal Tribunal’s determination:-

    
        “Leading Counsel for the Appellants contended that in exercising the discretion to approve building plans even if they contravene the TPB plans, the Building Authority and this Tribunal must do a balancing exercise on site specific considerations. We agree with this proposition and would incidentally observe that this approach underlines the difference between the functions of the Building Authority and this Tribunal on the one hand and the Town Planning Board on the other: whereas the Town Planning Board is concerned with planning considerations for a particular zone or area, the Building Authority and this Tribunal are of course concerned with a particular site or specific building development. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that in the objection hearing the Town Planning Board was not willing to revise the draft OZP for the sake of the Appellants’ building plans in respect of their specific site and were not therefore prepared to treat the Appellants’ Site as a special case.

        The Building Authority on the other hand is and can only be concerned with a specific site. Leading Counsel for the Appellants and Counsel for the Building Authority were agreed that relevant considerations for the exercise of this discretion were (a) whether the planning intention in the OZP is contravened and (b) whether there are special considerations which warrant approval. Leading Counsel for the Appellant also contended that the question as to whether or not there were special considerations relating to the Applicant or the application was a relevant consideration for the purpose of the exercise of the discretion. Counsel for the Building Authority contended otherwise but we are satisfied that in principle this factor is a relevant consideration for the exercise of the discretion.”
    

    68.  Mr Yu claims support for his argument because the 3 cases apparently distinguish between the TPB’s power to draw up plans for areas and the Building Authority’s power to accept or reject plans for a building within an area covered by a layout plan.  The TPB’s power must be “broad brush,” while the Building Authority’s power is building specific.  An attempt by the TPB (Mr Yu submits) to regulate by an OZP what can or cannot be done in a particular building would be an unlawful extension of the TPB’s jurisdiction and an encroachment upon the Building Authority’s competence.

    69.  To bolster his argument, Mr Yu referred me to Town Planning Bill 2000 cls. 8 and 9. Those would have conferred specific powers on the TPB to prepare OZPs providing (among other matters) for “the control of height, number of storeys, plot ratio, gross floor area, site coverage, number of flats, disposition and use of buildings, which may vary from building to buildings in the same land use zone”. 

    70.  The 2000 Bill (Mr Yu says) would have extended the TPB’s powers to the regulation of individual buildings within a zone or area.  But, the Bill never having been enacted, Mr Yu invites me to infer that the Government has tacitly accepted that for the time being the TPB’s powers are to be limited to the regulation of classes of buildings (as opposed to any specific building or development) within a zone or area.

    71.  Mr Yu stresses (citing Bokhary PJ in Wah Yick Enterprises Co Ltd. v. Building Authority (1999) 2 HKCFAR 170 (at 182G)) that, if there is ambiguity as to the ambit of a statutory power, the power should be construed narrowly.  The operative statute should not be interpreted to take away private rights of property without compensation.  A property owner is entitled to the benefit of any doubt over the extent of the power.

    72.  Mr Yu says that, in light of the perceived need to clarify the scope of the TPB’s power by the Town Planning Bill 2000, there must have been doubt about the scope of the TPB’s power under the present TPO to regulate what may or may not be done in a specific building or development within a zone.  If so, then applying Bokhary JA’s dictum in Wah Yick, Turbo Top should enjoy the benefit of that doubt.  The TPO should be construed in its favour.  To do otherwise, would be tantamount to depriving Turbo Top of property rights without compensation.

    73.  Mr Yu adds that, in any event, the proposed restriction (namely, the requirement that there be at least 800 spaces at the site) is unworkable.  Mr Yu asks rhetorically: If there is re-development of the site, how will the minimum parking spaces requirement work? If the sole existing building at the site has no public parking provision, would this mean that the next building will have to introduce all 800 spaces?  That (Mr Yu submits) cannot be right.

    74.  I am not persuaded by Mr Yu’s arguments.

    75.  First, I think (as Mr Mok submits) that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions fall squarely within the functions defined in the long title to the TPO and s. 3(1).  For the “convenience and general welfare” of the community, the TPB designated the site as C(1) and imposed a restriction on the number of public parking spaces there.

    76.  The C(1) zoning recognised an existing reality at the site (namely, that it had ceased to be 2 separate lots zoned G/IC and C), while the restriction safeguarded future availability of public car parking at the site. 

    77.  It would not be conducive to the public convenience to continue treating the site as something (2 separate lots) which it long had ceased to be. On the other hand, by imposing the restriction the TPB was preserving a public asset (the 800 car parking spaces) for use by the community in the future.

    78.  Nor did the TPB in imposing a parking space restriction act inflexibly.  Instead, by the 2nd and 3rd decisions, the TPB acknowledged that there could be minor relaxation of the 800 space minimum to cater for contingencies that might arise (such as the foreshadowed application by Turbo Top to convert 78 spaces to a supermarket).

    79.  The TPB exercised its power under TPO s. 4(1)(b) when it designated the site area in a layout plan as a zone for commercial use. 

    80.  It acted within its power under TPO s. 4(1)(c) when in Notes to the layout plan it reserved 800 car parking spaces in the site for community purposes. 

    81.  In any event, in so reserving 800 spaces, it also acted within the power conferred by the s. 4(1) proviso.  The imposition of the parking space restriction constituted making provision in a layout plan for “any matter whatsoever ... by means of such ... notes or descriptive matter as the Board thinks appropriate”.

    82.  Mr Yu submits that the s. 4(1) proviso should not be interpreted as giving the TPB wider powers than those already conferred by ss. 4(1)(a)-(i).  The s. 4(1) proviso (Mr Yu contends) only stipulates the means (diagrams, illustrations, notes or descriptive matter) by which the TPB can visually or verbally convey the zonings and other matters in ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) on a 2-dimensional layout plan.

    83.  But I do not think that is correct. 

    84.  Mr Yu accepts that the s. 4(1) proviso was enacted to restore what had been the case before Singway. 

    85.  Assume Mr Yu is right that the s. 4(1) proviso only concerns the means by which the TPB can show the matters in ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) on a layout plan.

    86.  Then, in effect, there would be no difference from the position immediately after Leonard J’s judgment in Singway.  On Mr Yu’s argument, ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) would be an exhaustive list of what the TPB could do in a layout plan. The s. 4(1) proviso would have added nothing and its enactment would have been in vain. 

    87.  The initial premise that the s.4(1) proviso restored what was the case before Singway would be contradicted by Mr Yu’s argument.  Consequently, I should not construe the s. 4(1) proviso in the unduly narrow manner which Mr Yu advocates.

    88.  Mr Yu observes that ss. 4(1)(f)-(i) were added to the TPO in 1988 and 1991 after the s. 4(1) proviso was added in 1974.  He asks, if the s. 4(1) proviso introduced a general power in 1974 over and above those enumerated in ss. 4(1)(a)-(e), why was there need to add ss. 4(1)(f)-(i)?  Why not just rely on the supposed general power in the s. 4(1) proviso?

    89.  The answer is to be found, in part at least, in the judgment of Litton JA in R v. Tang Ying Yip [1995] 2 HKC 277 (at 282C):-

    
        “The answer ... is simply this: the powers given by the legislature to the Board have evolved in the course of time, as the scope of responsibility of the Board increased with the growing urbanisation of the territory. The words ‘... and any matter whatsoever ... etc’ were added to s. 4(1) in 1974, to counteract the decision of the High Court in Singway ... Prior to those amendments, the zoning categories ended with para. (f). It would have been highly confusing if, in an effort to increase the powers of the Board, the legislature had deleted paras. (a) to (f), relying simply upon the generality of the additional words ‘... and any matter whatsoever may be shown ... etc’.”
    

    90.  There is a small error in Litton JA’s judgment. He referred to paras. (a)-(f) existing prior to the 1974 amendment of the TPO. In fact, para. (f) was not inserted until 1988.  I do not, however, believe that this error detracts from the thrust of his point. 

    91.  It would have been confusing to have increased the TPB’s powers to counteract Singway, while simultaneously deleting the powers listed in paras. (a)-(e).  Later, despite the existence of the s. 4(1) proviso, it was probably thought convenient to add paras. (f)-(i) to s. 4(1) as the most efficient way of introducing new types of zonings (comprehensive development, country parks, village type development, open storage).  In the absence of clear words to such effect, the addition of the new zonings to s. 4(1) could not have been intended to whittle down the width of the s. 4(1) proviso previously inserted to correct Singway.        

    92.  Second, I doubt that it is helpful pejoratively to label the proposed OZP amendments as the “micro-managing of a specific building”.  I do not think that is an appropriate way of looking at the present case.

    93.  As Mr Mok submits, what the TPB has actually done is to designate an area (the site) as a C(1) zone and to impose a car parking space restriction on that area.  That there currently happens to be a single building or development in the area is only fortuitous.  If (for instance) in the future third parties acquired parts of the site from Turbo Top for the purpose of erecting buildings on the portions so acquired, the same C(1) zoning and parking space restriction would apply to them unless relaxed by the TPB.

    94.  I see nothing in the cases cited by Mr Yu to suggest that the TPB cannot do what is has done by a layout plan of the site area.  In particular, there is nothing in the cases which cuts down the width and plain meaning of the s. 4(1) proviso. 

    95.  In Crozet Briggs CJ expressly stated that the TPB’s powers were “widely drawn ... and must be liberally construed”. Insofar as his obiter remarks about the TPB not including “such matters as the proportions, height and design of buildings” are concerned, Briggs CJ would only have been speaking generally, without any intention that his words should be treated as laying down any rigorous (as opposed to a merely rough and ready) rule. 

    96.  In any case, in reality the instant case concerns the zoning of, and the imposition of a restriction on, an area, regardless of the building or buildings that may be standing there now or in the future. 

    97.  There is the further consideration that, at the time of the decision in Crozet, the s. 4(1) proviso had yet to be added to the TPO.

    98.  It is true that in CC Tse, Cons JA described the Government’s arguments in connection with the s. 4(1) proviso as “doubtful starters”.  But he also made clear that he retained an open mind and was venturing no concluded opinion.

    99.  Cons JA did suggest that in dealing with the expression “types of building” in TPO s. 3(1) one should “look at the building as a building”.  Whatever that cryptic observation might mean, it could not have been intended as a gloss on what the TPB could or could not do in a layout plan within the terms of ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) and the s. 4(1) proviso.  The latter issue is different from the main and alternative arguments which the Court of Appeal considered in CC Tse in relation to TPO s. 3(1).

    100.  In Wing On Godfrey JA was drawing a general distinction between the functions of the TPB and the Building Authority.  It is unlikely that, by simply quoting the Building Appeal Tribunal with approval, he was intending to pronounce a hard and fast rule.  All he did was to draw a “broad brush” distinction between what the TPB and the Building Authority do. His dictum was intended to provide no more than a rule of thumb or common sense guidance.

    101.  In any case, Godfrey JA pointed that the TPB was essentially “concerned with planning considerations for a particular zone or area”.  That is what we are concerned with here.

    102.  Third, I find no relevant ambiguity in TPO ss. 3(1) or 4(1).  I therefore do not see how I can be assisted in construing the ambit of those provisions by reference to the abortive Town Planning Bill 2000.

    103.  Little can be inferred from the mere fact that the 2000 Bill was more specific in its enumeration of the TPB’s powers.  That more detailed enumeration, for example, might equally plausibly have been intended just to make crystal clear what is already sufficiently explicit in the TPO. 

    104.  Moreover, I do not think that the failure to pass the 2000 Bill logically implies (and can only imply) a tacit acceptance by the Government of particular limitations in the TPB’s powers.

    105.  Given the absence of ambiguity in the TPO’s provisions, it follows that the TPB has not here deprived Turbo Top of property rights.  Zoning may place restrictions on the uses to which a property can be put.  But zoning restrictions imposed in the public interest will not without more amount to a deprivation of property.  This is because when one acquires land, one takes the property subject to an implied condition that, for the public good, the Government may by regulation (including OZPs) limit the uses to which such land can be put in the future.

    106.  Fourth, I do not believe that there is anything unworkable about the requirement of a minimum of 800 parking spaces. 

    107.  Mr Yu’s rhetorical question assumes that the TPB imposes a requirement that there be at least 800 public car parking spaces in an area where currently there is not that number of parking spaces.  He then asks whether and (if so) why the first person to develop the site after the imposition of the requirement must bear the entire burden of making up the deficiency in car parking spaces. 

    108.  But Mr Yu’s assumption does not conform with the present situation.  Here the TPB has acknowledged the existence of 800 re-provisioned spaces and by its amendments to the OZP sought to ensure that at least that number (subject to minor relaxation) will be available to the public in the future at the site. 

    109.  Assume that third parties take over all or parts of the site from Turbo Top.  If any of those parties intends to develop a part of the site in a manner that reduces the 800 existing spaces, such party will have to apply to the TPB under TPO s. 16 for permission to do so. It does not appear that there is anything intrinsically unworkable about such a requirement.

    110.  Fifth, in oral submission, Mr Yu drew my attention to TPO s. 4A(1) which deals with the comprehensive development area zoning introduced in s. 4(1)(f). TPO s. 4A provides:-

    
        “(1) Without restricting what the Board may, under sections 3 and 4, show or make provision for in a plan, the Board may, by a note on the plan, in respect of a comprehensive development area, prohibit the undertaking of any building works, as defined in the Building Ordinance (Cap. 123), except:-

		
			(a) as specified in the note; or

			(b) with the permission of the Board, which permission may be granted by reference to a plan approved by the Board under subsection (2).”
		
    

    111.  Mr Yu suggested that, in contrast to s. 4(1), TPO s. 4A(1) allowed the TPB to impose restrictions on a specific building within a comprehensive development area zone.  But if that is right, then it seems to me that Mr Yu’s argument is undermined. 

    112.  To begin with, any power conferred by s. 4A(1) would on Mr Yu’s case have to be exercised in accordance with the purpose to the TPO as stipulated in its long title.  That purpose in the long title (Mr Yu argues) does not allow for the imposition by the TPB of restrictions on a specific building (as opposed to a particular area).  But, if that is so, how can the TPB impose, consistently with the long title, restrictions on a specific building under s. 4A(1)? The TPB could only so act if its raison d’etre (as defined by the TPO’s long title) enabled it to do so. That the TPB may (as it undoubtedly can) “micro-manage” in relation to a specific building under s. 4A(1), implies that Mr Yu’s narrow reading of the scope of the long title is wrong.

    113.  My reasoning is fortified by the subordinate clause which begins s. 4A(1).  Nothing in s. 4A(1) is to be treated as diminishing the Board’s wide powers under TPO ss. 3(1) and 4(1).  Thus, if the TPB can “micro-manage” by imposing a restriction (say) on a particular building in a comprehensive development area under s. 4A(1), the TPB must be able to do similarly in relation to other zonings under s. 4(1).

    C. Complaint (2): Inconsistency

    114.  The result of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions is an OZP with a Schedule of Uses that in Column 1 of its “Commercial” section identifies “Uses always permitted” within the site.   Such uses listed under Column 1 include, for instance, “Shop and Services”. 

    115.  But the “Commercial” section also contains “Remarks” which (among other things) impose a requirement (subject to minor relaxation) that there be a minimum of 800 public car parking spaces at the site.

    116.  Mr Yu submits that there is an internal inconsistency within the “Commercial” section.  On the one hand, according to Column 1, a property owner can always use the site for purposes listed in Column 1 without seeking TPB permission.  On the other hand, if an intended Column 1 use will lead to a reduction in the 800 car parking spaces, the owner must seek the TPB’s permission for a relaxation.  The Column 1 use in such case would not be “always permitted”.  Thus, the “Uses always permitted” designation of Column 1 is contradicted by the “Remarks”.  That (Mr Yu submits) is irrational.

    117.  I disagree.  There is no irrational inconsistency.

    118.  The OZP is a statutory instrument and, like all statutes, must be construed in a way that will make sense of it as a whole. One cannot read a part of the OZP in isolation from the rest.

    119.  Self-evidently, the Column 1 description of “always permitted” is to be read as qualified by the “Remarks”.  To the extent that a Column 1 use does not contravene the “Remarks,” then to that extent the use may be regarded as “always permitted” and no reference to the TPB needs to be made.

    D. Complaint (3): Irrelevant or erroneous considerations taken into account

    120.  Mr Yu complains that in zoning the site C(1) “to reflect the completed development on the site” the TPB abdicated its responsibility of planning for the future.  Planning involves providing for the future.  In contrast, Mr Yu contends that “reflecting the completed development” solely entails looking to the past. 

    121.  Mr Yu adds that the existing development at the site was not the result of the exercise by the TPB of a planning judgment. There was no requirement (Mr Yu says) for Turbo Top to apply for TPB permission to build CKC and its ancillary structures.  Planning permission was only sought as a public relations exercise to placate the Government which was insisting that Turbo Top apply to the TPB.

    122.  I am unable to accept Mr Yu’s argument.

    123.  Even if Turbo Top only went through the motions of applying for TPB permission for public relations reasons, Turbo Top must be held bound by the statements and representations which it made in its application.  The Court cannot ignore the fact that an application to the TPB was made at the time and that the TPB assessed from a planning perspective whether the CKC development was appropriate.  The building of CKC must have involved planning considerations on the part of the TPB.

    124.  Nor do I understand why the recognition by the TPB of the state of affairs which had been achieved through the development of CKC at the site should involve an “abdication” of planning responsibilities. In proposing amendments to the OZP, the TPB was confirming the reality of an existing state of affairs at the site as the starting point for any future development of the area.  In so doing, the TPB would have been looking not just to the past, but also to the future.  

    125.  Mr Yu further complains that, in coming to its decisions, the TPB acted on the views of Transport Department (as conveyed to the TPB by its Secretary).  Those views were to the effect that “taking into account the imminent developments/redevelopments in Central,” it would be prudent keep the 78 public parking spaces which Turbo Top wished to convert into a supermarket.   

    126.  Mr Yu says that, to the extent that the TPB acted upon Transport Department’s views, the TPB would have taken into account irrelevant or erroneous considerations. 

    127.  Mr Yu argues that no consideration has ever been given to the appropriate number of parking spaces required in the site area. The only available study, that commissioned by Turbo Top for the purposes of its proposal to convert 78 spaces into a supermarket, suggests that the 800 currently available public spaces are under-utilised.

    128.  Mr Yu submits that, if the TPB wished to act upon Transport Department’s views, it ought first to have investigated whether those views were justified.  It could not simply have acted on the views on the assertion of the Transport Department.  Insofar as the TPB did nothing to verify the views, the TPB acted in a way that was unfair to Turbo Top.

    129.  As I indicated to Mr Yu during oral submission, it seems on the evidence that the TPB did not place any weight on the Transport Department’s views in coming to its decisions.  Instead, the TPB focused on the fact that the CKC development entailed a re-provisioning of the pre-existing 800 public spaces at the Garden Road car park.  The TPB’s decisions treated the re-provisioned parking spaces as a public asset which should be preserved, subject to minor relaxation.

    130.  Consequently, it is unnecessary to consider whether, in taking account of Transport Department’s views, the TPB wrongly conducted itself.  The TPB took no account of the Transport Department’s views in coming to its decisions.  Mr Mok did not strongly resist this conclusion in the course of his submissions.

    131.  But I do not accept Mr Yu’s still further suggestion that, in focusing on the re-provisioning of the 800 spaces, the TPB also acted outside its remit.  In my view, the TPB was fully entitled in the exercise of its planning functions to treat the 800 spaces as a public asset which should be preserved for the future benefit of the area. 

    132.  The spaces may currently be under-utilised.  But prudent planning strategy can include the preservation of an existing feature to meet unknown or unexpected contingencies, even where the feature may not be much used or appreciated at the moment.

    E. Complaint (4): Procedural irregularity in the 3rd decision

    133.  The 3rd decision removed the GFA restriction on the 800 car parking spaces.  The TPB decided this of its own motion without first informing Turbo Top or giving it the opportunity to be heard on that matter.  Mr Yu says this was procedurally unfair.  Had it been informed, Turbo Top argues that it could have submitted that the whole car parking restriction should have been removed.

    134.  There is nothing in this point. 

    135.  By the 1st and 2nd decisions the TPB had already decided not to remove the car parking restriction.  At its meeting on 13 May 2011 the TPB’s Secretary pointed out that, as a matter of practice, where the TPB had imposed a minimum number of car parking spaces on an area, the TPB did not also impose a minimum GFA for the car parking spaces.  The TPB accordingly deleted the car parking GFA restriction to conform with its past practice. There is no unfairness in that.

    136.  Mr Yu suggests that on one reading of the minutes of the TPB’s 13 May 2011 meeting the Secretary pointed out something other than what I have just stated.  But I do not accept that Mr Yu’s interpretation of the minutes is the correct or natural reading.

    F. Complaint (5): Discriminatory treatment

    137.  The criticism is that the TPB did not impose an analogous parking requirement in the IFC site.  Nevertheless, the TPB deleted the GFA retail restriction in the CKC site because there was no retail restriction in the IFC site.  So (Mr Yu concludes) the IFC and CKC sites have not been treated in like manner.

    138.  I do not find this a compelling point. Comparing the IFC and CKC developments is akin to comparing apples and oranges.  What is true of one site would not necessarily be true or applicable to the other.

    139.  It is correct that the TPB deleted the GFA retail restriction for the CKC on the basis that there was no such in the IFC. But it does not follow that the omission or imposition of any restriction in the IFC should also be mirrored in the CKC site. 

    140.  The IFC scheme was one for mixed uses (office, hotel and retail).  In contrast, the CKC site was intended for office and car park, with limited retail space (no more than 680 sq m).  It is not therefore possible meaningfully to compare one development with the other and conclude that, because one has or does not have some restriction, there has been arbitrary or unfair discrimination in respect of the other.

    G. Miscellaneous complaints

    141.  I deal here with 2 minor complaints made by Turbo Top.

    142.  In its Notice for Judicial Review, Turbo Top criticises the TPB for failing to rectify the discrepancy between the C(1) zone boundary shown in the OZP and the actual CKC site boundary.  This criticism is unjustified.  The OZP is a “broad brush” plan drawn on a small scale (1:5000). No material confusion could result from the slight discrepancies between the OZP and the actual site boundary.

    143.  Turbo Top also complains that the reasons for the TPB’s decisions here typically follow wording found in briefing papers prepared by the Planning Department for the TPB.  In my view, such tracking of wording merely reflects general practice.  The tracking does not necessarily mean that the TPB failed to give independent consideration to the representations before it.  On the contrary, in this case, the minutes of the TPB’s meetings show that members actively engaged in discussion of the matters before them before arriving at their independent conclusions.

    H. Summary

    144.  The long title to the TPO and ss. 3(1) and 4(1) therein (including the s. 4(1) proviso) are “widely drawn and must be construed liberally”. There is no ambiguity in their extent as far as this case is concerned.  The provisions read in their ordinary and natural meaning are wide enough to empower the TPB to zone the site as C(1) and impose an 800 public parking space restriction on that area.  There has been no encroachment on the jurisdiction of the Building Authority. 

    145.  There is no inconsistency within the Explanatory Statement of the draft amended OZP.  Nor has there been any abdication of responsibility, improper consideration, or procedural unfairness in the manner in which the TPB has conducted itself here.

    146.  Finally, there is no compelling case of discriminatory conduct on the part of the TPB as far as the treatment of the CKC and IFC are concerned.               

    IV. CONCLUSION

    147.  The judicial reviews in HCAL 23 and 52 fail. They are dismissed.

    148.  The interim stays of the submission to the Chief Executive in Council of the draft amended OZP which I previously ordered are to be lifted.  But such lifting is not to come into effect for 7 days from this Judgment in order to give Turbo Top time to consider whether to apply for an interim stay of the lifting pending appeal.  If Turbo Top applies within those 7 days for an interim stay, the lifting is to be further stayed pending consideration of Turbo Top’s application.  Any such application by Turbo Top for an interim stay pending appeal should be listed before me to be heard at the soonest possible opportunity (estimated length 30 minutes).  If necessary, to accommodate at least one counsel on each side, the application can be listed for hearing at 4.30 pm.

    149.  There will be an Order Nisi that Turbo Top pay the TPB’s costs of both judicial reviews (including any reserved costs), such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  There will be certificate for 2 counsel.

    150.  There will be liberty to apply.

    ______________

    I. INTRODUCTION

    1.  Turbo Top is a subsidiary of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.

    2.  Turbo Top owns the site at the junction of Queen’s Road Central and Garden Road. Cheung Kong Center (CKC) (a commercial tower) now occupies the site. In addition, there is a public open space in front of CKC; a car park of 1,046 parking spaces (800 for public and 246 for private use); a public garden at the car park’s deck level; a public toilet; and a small commercial space of about 648 sq m used as a fast food outlet.  The development originally included a post office. But the space occupied by the latter is now used by a Government office.    

    3.  The site formerly comprised the Hong Kong Hilton, Beaconsfield House (where Government offices were situated) and the Garden Road Car Park (which had 800 public car parking spaces). 

    4.  Turbo Top acquired the site in November 1996 under an Agreement with Government.  It was a special condition of the Agreement that Turbo Top maintain a public car park of at least 800 spaces at the site.  It was also a special condition of the Agreement that Turbo Top erect a development at the site having a specified minimum GFA, of which not more than 680 sq m could be for retail purposes.

    5.  Turbo Top now challenges amendments proposed by the Town Planning Board (TPB) to the Outline Zoning Plan (OZP) for the area where the site is situated. 

    6.  Turbo Top objected to the amendments when they were gazetted.  On 21 January 2011 TPB rejected Turbo Top’s objections. 

    7.  The TPB then further considered the OZP amendments as a result of representations by members of the public (including Turbo Top).  As a result, on 15 April 2011 the TPB accepted some representations (including some by Turbo Top).

    8.  On 13 May 2011 the TPB of its own decided to vary the proposed OZP amendments yet further.

    9.  Turbo Top contends that the TPB’s decisions of 21 January, 15 April and 13 May 2011 (respectively, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions) were invalid for various reasons.  By HCAL 23 Turbo Top attacked the 1st decision.  By HCAL 52 Turbo Top attacked the 2nd and 3rd decisions.  Since both sets of proceedings are inter-related, they have been heard together.  

    10.  Turbo Top’s main complaint is that, in proposing to amend the relevant OZP, the TPB exceeded its jurisdiction.  The TPB (Turbo Top says) is only authorised by the Town Planning Ordinance (Cap.131) (TPO) to prepare and approve plans for the layout of areas of Hong Kong.  According to the long title to the TPO, the TPB should do this in order “[t]o promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community”. 

    11.  What the TPB cannot do (Turbo Top suggests) is impose restrictions on a specific building (such as CKC) within an area.  That (Turbo Top complains) is to usurp the power of the Building Authority which regulates what can or what cannot be done in relation to a given building. 

    12.  The TPB’s powers (Turbo Top argues) are merely “broad brush” in relation to areas of Hong Kong.  The TPB’s powers do not allow the TPB to engage in the “micro-management” of a building by the preparation and approval of plans which state what can or should not be done in a building.

    II. BACKGROUND

    13.  Since 1981 the site has had 2 zonings.  About 0.64 ha is zoned G/IC, while the remaining 0.32 ha is zoned C.

    14.  Cheung Kong submitted a proposal for the comprehensive re-development of the site in 1994.  ExCo agreed to the re-development scheme in 1995.  The Lands Department then negotiated terms of exchange. 

    15.  A pre-requisite for implementation of the scheme was the obtaining by Cheung Kong of the TPB’s approval for the redevelopment pursuant to TPO s. 16.  Cheung Kong did not regard it as strictly necessary from a legal standpoint to apply for TPB approval. Nonetheless, for “public relations” reasons, it agreed to seek TPB approval as required by Government.

    16.  A selling-point of Cheung Kong’s planning application was that the re-development would include re-provisioning of the 800 public parking spaces that would be lost through demolition of the Garden Road Car Park. 

    17.  The re-provisioning was a matter of concern to Government at the time.  This is evident, for instance, from comments on the scheme by the Project Manager (Hong Kong & Islands) (PM(HK&I)).  The latter stressed that “[t]he existing public facilities within the redevelopment site such as public car park, public toilets, Post Office etc. must be adequately re-provisioned so as to safeguard the interest of the public”.

    18.  In October 1995 the TPB notified Cheung Kong that its TPO s.16 application had been approved.  It was a condition of approval that “the provision, management and maintenance of the public car park including temporary re-provisioning arrangements” be to “the satisfaction of the Commissioner for Transport or of the [TPB]”.

    19.  In November 1996 Government and Turbo Top entered into the Agreement and Conditions of Exchange whereby the latter was granted the site as one lot (not 2 distinct lots as formerly). 

    20.  In June 2008 Turbo Top applied to the Lands Department for modification of its lease conditions to allow 78 public parking spaces (located in the C zone) to be converted to a supermarket. 

    21.  In support, Turbo Top commissioned a car park study.  That showed that peak utilisation of the public parking spaces was only 68.3%.  Nearby car parking (such as at Citibank Tower and Murray Road) also revealed low utilisation rates.

    22.  In July 2010 the Transport Department indicated that it had no objection to the proposed conversion of 78 spaces to a supermarket.

    23.  Meanwhile, in June 2010, the TPB’s Metro Planning Committee proposed re-zoning the site from C and G/IC to C(1).  This would be done “to reflect the existing development on the site”.

    24.  The proposed OZP amendments were gazetted on 16 July 2010. 

    25.  The draft OZP amendments stated in “Remarks” within the “Commercial” section of the Schedule of Uses:-

    
        “On land designated ‘Commercial (1)’, no new development, or addition, alteration and/or modification to or redevelopment of an existing building shall result in a total development and/or redevelopment in excess of a maximum non-domestic gross floor area of 144,840 m2, of which a gross floor area of not more than 680 m2 shall be used for retail purpose, and gross floor areas of not less than 700 m2 and 25,000 m2 shall be used respectively for Government facilities and public car park with a minimum of 800 public car parking spaces. Public open space of not less than 5,200 m2 shall be provided.”
    

    26.  On 16 September 2010 Turbo Top submitted representations (referred to as “R7”) objecting to the OZP amendments affecting the site.  Other parties also made representations.

    27.  To assist the TPB when considering the representations, the Planning Department prepared Paper No. 8703.  On R7, that paper stated:-

    
        “TD [Transport Department] has advised that taking onto account the imminent developments/redevelopments in Central, which include a number of private developments alongside Queen’s Road Central without public car parking spaces, it would be prudent to keep 78 car parking spaces at Cheung Kong Center. It should be noted that what R7 asks for is deleting the stipulation of the requirements relating to the public car park in the Notes, rather than just the 78 car parking spaces. The implication of such proposal is far more significant.”
    

    28.  At its 21 January 2011 meeting, the TPB by the 1st decision rejected R7.  Its reasons for so doing were as follows:-

    
        “(a) the rezoning of the Cheung Kong Center site to C(1) was to reflect the completed development of the site. The stipulation of the specific GFA restrictions in the Notes followed the entitlements under the lease which reflected the development scheme approved by the Board. There was provision under the Notes for minor relaxation of the GFA restrictions on application to the Board.

        (b) the public car park was for the re-provisioning of the ex-Garden Road Multi-storey Car Park, and the government facilities provided within the site are for the re-provisioning of similar facilities in the ex-Beaconsfield House, continuous provision of these facilities should be ensured by imposing specific control in the Notes of the ‘C(1)’ zone; and

        (c) the OZP was a small-scale plan and it was intended to illustrate only the broad land use zonings. Since there was provision in the covering Notes of the OZP allowing boundaries between zones be subject to minor adjustments, realignment of the boundary to follow the lot boundary was considered not necessary.”
    

    29.  Note that there is a slight discrepancy between the boundary of the area zoned C(1) in the draft amended OZP and the actual site boundary.  Reason (c) concerned Turbo Top’s request that the OZP zoning boundary be re-drawn to conform with the site’s actual boundary.

    30.  On 18 February 2011 the TPB gazetted a revision to its proposed amendments to the OZP pursuant to TPO s. 6B(8).  The TPB put forward the revision in response to certain representations (identified as “R2” and “R5”) on the proposed OZP amendments.

    31.  The revision was supposed to make clear the planning intention behind the amendments.  Thus, the revision would expressly state that the C(1) zone was intended primarily for comprehensive development/ redevelopment for office use and provision of public car park, Government facilities and public open space, with supporting shop, services and eating place. 

    32.  On 10 March 2011 Turbo Top objected to the gazetted revision without prejudice to its previous representations.

    33.  At its 15 April 2011 meeting, the TPB by the 2nd decision rejected Turbo Top’s further representation (known as “F1”) against the inclusion of a statement of planning intention.  Instead, the TPB justified the revision to the OZP thus:-

    
        “To address the concern of some representers and commenter as well as the public on possible loss of Government, Institution or Community facilities and public open space due to the rezoning amendment of the CKC site from ‘Government Institution or Community’ and ‘Commercial’ to ‘C(1)’, it is considered appropriate to explain clearly the history/rationale of the rezoning and the planning control imposed on the site by revising the relevant parts of the Notes and ES [Explanatory Statement] to clearly set out that the planning intention of the ‘C(1)’ zone which is primarily for office use and the provision of public car park, government facilities and public open space, with supporting shop, services and eating place.”
    

    34.  At its 15 April meeting, the TPB by the 2nd decision also heeded some of Turbo Top’s objections. 

    35.  It decided to delete the retail GFA restriction which it had sought to impose on the site.  It did so to make the proposed amendments to the OZP insofar as the site was concerned “consistent with the development restrictions imposed on the IFC site”.

    36.  It decided to retain the requirement of 800 parking spaces, but it resolved “to incorporate provision for minor relaxation of the restriction on the minimum number of public car parking spaces on application for the C(1) zone”. 

    37.  Having made its 2nd decision, the TPB requested its Secretariat “to work out the amendments to the Notes and Explanatory Statement of the OZP for the Board’s further consideration”.   

    38.  On 13 May the TPB by the 3rd decision deleted the restriction of a minimum GFA for car parking spaces at the site.  According to the minutes of the meeting, the deletion was prompted by an observation of the TPB’s Secretary (Ms. Ophelia Wong).  She had pointed out that:-

    
        “for other OZPs, the general practice was to stipulate car parking requirement for particular sites either in terms of minimum GFA or minimum number of parking spaces. For consistency, it was therefore suggested that the restriction on the provision of a minimum GFA for public car parking for the C(1) zone be deleted.”
    

    39.  Turbo Top was informed of the 3rd decision on 18 May 2011.  Until then it had no idea that the TPB was considering the deletion of the minimum GFA for car parking spaces at the site.

    40.  Turbo Top’s principal complaints are as follows:-

    
        (1) The 1st decision and, consequently, amendments to the 1st decision made by the 2nd and 3rd decisions were ultra vires. That was because the decisions constituted impermissible micro-managing by the TPB of the uses of a specific building (CKC), rather than an area.

        (2) The proposed OZP amendments (as proposed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions) are inconsistent.

        (3) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions were based on irrelevant or erroneous considerations.

        (4) The 3rd decision was vitiated by procedural irregularity.

        (5) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions are arbitrary and discriminatory.
    

    III. DISCUSSION

    A. Preliminary

    41.  Before examining Turbo Top’s complaints, I should deal with a preliminary point raised by Mr Johnny Mok SC (appearing for the TPB). 

    42.  Mr Mok submits that HCAL 23 was premature.  That is because, when HCAL 23 was commenced, the TPB had yet to consider Turbo Top’s further representation (F1) at its 15 April 2011 meeting.  The 2nd decision, which was the outcome of that meeting, accepted some of Turbo Top’s arguments and varied the OZP amendments originally proposed. 

    43.  According to Mr Mok, this suggests that Turbo Top should have waited for the outcome of the 15 April meeting before initiating a judicial review.

    44.  But, as I indicated to Mr Mok and Mr Benjamin Yu SC (appearing for Turbo Top), I do not think that I should dismiss HCAL 23 on the purely technical ground of being premature. There is little point in so doing.

    45.  I doubt that the application was premature, since it seems to me that as of 21 January 2011 the TPB had firmly decided to revise the zoning of the site and impose restrictions on what could be done there.  The precise nature of those restrictions may have been varied later in response to other representations (for instance, R2 and R5, as opposed to R7). But the variations were in effect “fine-tuning” of the substantive decision already taken to reject R7.

    46.  I do not have to determine the question conclusively. 

    47.  By any reckoning, even in considering HCAL 53, I would have to grapple with at least the key issues raised by HCAL No. 23.  HCAL No. 23 queries the 1st decision.  HCAL 53 queries the 2nd and 3rd decisions.  Even if HCAL 23 were premature, I would still have to assess the essential legality of the 1st decision (or what survives of it), if only to arrive at conclusions on the vires of the 2nd and 3rd decisions. 

    48.  It follows that it would be wrong to dismiss HCAL 23 off-hand.  I need to deal with the thrust of the argument there at the very least.  It would accordingly be an arid exercise to spend significant time on the niceties of whether, when HCAL 23 of 2011 was initiated, the 1st decision had definitely rejected R7 or only reflected a provisional view on R7’s merits.

    49.  I shall proceed then on the foregoing basis.  In so doing, I am mindful that I cannot ignore subsequent events.  I accept Mr Mok’s caveat that I ought in any event to focus on what now remains of the 1st decision, namely, the re-zoning of the site from distinct G/IC and C zones to a C(1) zone and the imposition of a requirement (subject to minor relaxation upon application) that there be at least 800 public parking spaces in the site.  It would be academic to consider those elements of the 1st decision which the 2nd and 3rd decisions have superseded.

    B. Complaint (1): Impermissible micro-managing by TPB

    50.  Mr Yu’s submission begins with the long title to the TPO.  That expresses the TPO’s purpose:-

    
        “To promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community by making provision for the systematic preparation and approval of plans for the lay-out of areas of Hong Kong as well as for the types of building suitable for erection therein and for the preparation and approval of plans for areas within which permission is required for development.”
    

    51.  The long title is echoed in TPO s. 3(1)(a). That confers on the TPB a power to “undertake the systematic preparation of draft plans for the lay-out of such areas of Hong Kong as the Chief Executive may direct, as well as the types of building suitable for erection therein”. Such power is to be exercised “[w]ith a view to the promotion of the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the community”.

    52.  TPO s. 4(1) specifies how the TPB may exercise the power conferred by s. 3(1)(a) in respect of layout plans.  TPO s. 4(1) provides:-

    
        “The Board’s draft plans prepared under section 3(1)(a) for the layout of any such area may show or make provision for:-

		
			(a) streets, railways and other main communications;

			(b) zones or districts set apart for use for residential, commercial, industiral or other specified uses;

			(c) reserves for Government, institution or community purposes;

			(d) parks, recreation grounds and similar open spaces;

			(e) zones or districts set apart for undetermined uses;

			(f) comprehensive development areas;

			(g) country parks, coastal protection areas, sites of specific interest, green belts or other specified uses that promote conservation or protection of the environment;

			(h) zones or districts set apart for use for village type development, agriculture or other specified rural uses;

			(i) zones or districts set apart for use for open storage,
		

        and any matter whatsoever may be shown or provided for or specified in or in respect of the plans by means of such diagrams, illustrations, notes or descriptive matter as the Board thinks appropriate; and any such diagrams, illustrations, notes and descriptive matters shall be part of the plans.”
    

    53.  TPO s. 4(1)(f) was added in 1988.  TPO ss. 4(1)(g)-(i) were added in 1991.

    54.  The words beginning “and any matter whatsoever ...” in s. 4(1) were added in 1974.  I shall refer to those words as “the s. 4(1) proviso”.  They were added to bring s. 4(1) in line with what had been thought to be the position prior to the High Court’s judgment in Singway v. AG [1974] HKLR 275. 

    55.  Before Singway, it had been assumed that ss. 4(1)(a)-(e) were illustrative, not exhaustive, of what the TPB could make provision for in a layout plan.  But Singway held otherwise.  Applying the maxim that the expression of a specific matter implied the exclusion of any other matter (expressio unius, exclusio alterius), Leonard J read the list in paras. (a)-(e) as an exhaustive statement of what the TPB could designate in a layout plan.

    56.  Had the TPO not been amended by the s. 4(1) proviso, Singway would have invalidated numerous OZPs, all based on a mistaken assumption as to the width of the power in s. 4(1).  See Explanatory Memorandum to the Town Planning (Amendment and Validation) Bill of 1974.

    57.  I pause to note that TPO s. 16 was also a response to Singway.  That was enacted to confer flexibility.  It enabled the TPB, where there is provision in an OZP for relaxation of a restriction, to grant permission upon application for the restriction to be relaxed in a particular case.

    58.  Mr Yu infers from the long-title and TPO ss. 3(1)(a) and 4(1) that the TPB’s approach in drawing up plans must be “broad brush”.  The TPB’s statutory powers can only be exercised in relation to areas or in respect of the types of buildings in particular areas.  The TPB cannot engage in “spot-zoning” by specifying some restriction affecting only a particular building within a given area.  If the TPB were to engage in such, it would be encroaching (Mr Yu says) upon the role of the Building Authority.

    59.  Mr Yu supports his reading of the TPB’s limited power with dicta from a trilogy of cases: Crozet v. AG [1973-76] HKC 97; AG v. CC Tse (Estate) Ltd. [1982] HKLR 7 (CA); and Wing On Ltd. v. Building Authority (1996) 6 HKPLR 432 (CA).

    60.  In Crozet (decided before Singway), Briggs CJ held that the TPB had power to specify the plot ratio for buildings in an area.  He observed that the TPB’s powers were widely drawn in the TPO and should be liberally construed.  But he cautioned (at 100E) that the TPB’s powers under the TPO “do not include such matters as the proportions, height and design of buildings”.  That was because the latter matters had been “left to the Building Authority under the Buildings Ordinance”.

    61.  In CC Tse (decided after Singway), it was argued that the TPB had no power under s. 3(1) to make provision for “the types of building suitable for erection” in a particular area otherwise than by reference to one or more of the matters listed in the paragraphs of s. 4(1).  Since s. 4(1) did not specifically mention plot ratio, it was submitted that the TPB could not regulate the plot ratios of buildings in a particular area. In the alternative, it was argued that plot ratio could not be equated with the expression “types of building” in s. 3(1). 

    62.  At first instance, CC Tse had successfully challenged the validity of the plot ratio restriction in the relevant OZP.  In the course of his judgment, Liu J suggested that “types of buildings” meant “classes of buildings sharing common characteristics”.

    63.  The Court of Appeal rejected the submission that the general power to make provision for “types of building” in s. 3(1) was constrained by the specific list in s. 4(1) dealing with layout plans. 

    64.  In considering the Applicant’s alternative argument, Cons JA stated (at 14H ff.):-

    
        “It seems to me that what is done inside a building is not a satisfactory characteristic for determining the type of that building, which is more a question of design. This could be introduced into [Liu J’s] definition by the addition of the word ‘architectural’, so that it would then read: ‘“types of building” means classes of building sharing common architectural characteristics’, or to put it in another way, when we wish to know into which type or types of building a particular building falls, we must look at the building as a building.

        The question then is whether plot ratio is an architectural characteristic. In my opinion it is. As I understand the term it means the relationship between the floor area of the building and the ground on which it could be built....

        It is thus not a rigid feature. It is a matter of proportion which leaves the architect considerable latitude, in theory at least. He may design a la pancake or a la pencil, or somewhere between those two extremes. Nonetheless, the resultant buildings will all have something in common. All will have the same relationship of floor area to site area. That is something which relates to the building as a building and in my view is an architectural characteristic as much as an auditorium or a garage. It may not be as readily discernible to the untrained eye, but it is there all the same, and its effect would, I feel confident, be immediately discernible to anyone were he faced with buildings of plot ratios as widely varied as those we are concerned with here.”
    

    65.  Cons JA obliquely contrasted (at 15F) the powers of the Building Authority under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO) with those of the TPB under the TPO:-

    
        “A further objection was that the legislation cannot have intended the Town Planning Ordinance to deal with a matter of this kind because it is fully and specifically dealt with in regulations made under the Buildings Ordinance Cap. 123; the Town Planning Ordinance was meant to give guidance only of the ‘broad brush’ kind, not to deal with fine particulars of this nature.

        It seems to me however that the restriction imposed in the present instance is of the ‘broad brush’ kind...”
    

    66.  Having rejected the Applicant’s main and alternative arguments, Cons JA did not deal with the Government’s points on the scope of the TPB’s power under TPO s. 4(1).  But Cons JA remarked (at 15F):-

    
        “The Attorney General had two or perhaps three further arguments based upon the last paragraph of section 4(1) [that is, the s. 4(1) proviso] or upon Crozet’s case HCMP 409/73, unreported. I venture to think that all were doubtful starters but express no concluded opinion....”
    

    67.  In Wing On, the Court of Appeal held that the Building Authority retained a discretion under BO s. 16 to approve building plans even where they contravened an OZP.  In the course of a concurring judgment, Godfrey JA approved (at 438D ff) the following passage from the Building Appeal Tribunal’s determination:-

    
        “Leading Counsel for the Appellants contended that in exercising the discretion to approve building plans even if they contravene the TPB plans, the Building Authority and this Tribunal must do a balancing exercise on site specific considerations. We agree with this proposition and would incidentally observe that this approach underlines the difference between the functions of the Building Authority and this Tribunal on the one hand and the Town Planning Board on the other: whereas the Town Planning Board is concerned with planning considerations for a particular zone or area, the Building Authority and this Tribunal are of course concerned with a particular site or specific building development. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that in the objection hearing the Town Planning Board was not willing to revise the draft OZP for the sake of the Appellants’ building plans in respect of their specific site and were not therefore prepared to treat the Appellants’ Site as a special case.

        The Building Authority on the other hand is and can only be concerned with a specific site. Leading Counsel for the Appellants and Counsel for the Building Authority were agreed that relevant considerations for the exercise of this discretion were (a) whether the planning intention in the OZP is contravened and (b) whether there are special considerations which warrant approval. Leading Counsel for the Appellant also contended that the question as to whether or not there were special considerations relating to the Applicant or the application was a relevant consideration for the purpose of the exercise of the discretion. Counsel for the Building Authority contended otherwise but we are satisfied that in principle this factor is a relevant consideration for the exercise of the discretion.”
    

    68.  Mr Yu claims support for his argument because the 3 cases apparently distinguish between the TPB’s power to draw up plans for areas and the Building Authority’s power to accept or reject plans for a building within an area covered by a layout plan.  The TPB’s power must be “broad brush,” while the Building Authority’s power is building specific.  An attempt by the TPB (Mr Yu submits) to regulate by an OZP what can or cannot be done in a particular building would be an unlawful extension of the TPB’s jurisdiction and an encroachment upon the Building Authority’s competence.

    69.  To bolster his argument, Mr Yu referred me to Town Planning Bill 2000 cls. 8 and 9. Those would have conferred specific powers on the TPB to prepare OZPs providing (among other matters) for “the control of height, number of storeys, plot ratio, gross floor area, site coverage, number of flats, disposition and use of buildings, which may vary from building to buildings in the same land use zone”. 

    70.  The 2000 Bill (Mr Yu says) would have extended the TPB’s powers to the regulation of individual buildings within a zone or area.  But, the Bill never having been enacted, Mr Yu invites me to infer that the Government has tacitly accepted that for the time being the TPB’s powers are to be limited to the regulation of classes of buildings (as opposed to any specific building or development) within a zone or area.

    71.  Mr Yu stresses (citing Bokhary PJ in Wah Yick Enterprises Co Ltd. v. Building Authority (1999) 2 HKCFAR 170 (at 182G)) that, if there is ambiguity as to the ambit of a statutory power, the power should be construed narrowly.  The operative statute should not be interpreted to take away private rights of property without compensation.  A property owner is entitled to the benefit of any doubt over the extent of the power.

    72.  Mr Yu says that, in light of the perceived need to clarify the scope of the TPB’s power by the Town Planning Bill 2000, there must have been doubt about the scope of the TPB’s power under the present TPO to regulate what may or may not be done in a specific building or development within a zone.  If so, then applying Bokhary JA’s dictum in Wah Yick, Turbo Top should enjoy the benefit of that doubt.  The TPO should be construed in its favour.  To do otherwise, would be tantamount to depriving Turbo Top of property rights without compensation.

    73.  Mr Yu adds that, in any event, the proposed restriction (namely, the requirement that there be at least 800 spaces at the site) is unworkable.  Mr Yu asks rhetorically: If there is re-development of the site, how will the minimum parking spaces requirement work? If the sole existing building at the site has no public parking provision, would this mean that the next building will have to introduce all 800 spaces?  That (Mr Yu submits) cannot be right.

    74.  I am not persuaded by Mr Yu’s arguments.

    75.  First, I think (as Mr Mok submits) that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions fall squarely within the functions defined in the long title to the TPO and s. 3(1).  For the “convenience and general welfare” of the community, the TPB designated the site as C(1) and imposed a restriction on the number of public parking spaces there.

    76.  The C(1) zoning recognised an existing reality at the site (namely, that it had ceased to be 2 separate lots zoned G/IC and C), while the restriction safeguarded future availability of public car parking at the site. 

    77.  It would not be conducive to the public convenience to continue treating the site as something (2 separate lots) which it long had ceased to be. On the other hand, by imposing the restriction the TPB was preserving a public asset (the 800 car parking spaces) for use by the community in the future.

    78.  Nor did the TPB in imposing a parking space restriction act inflexibly.  Instead, by the 2nd and 3rd decisions, the TPB acknowledged that there could be minor relaxation of the 800 space minimum to cater for contingencies that might arise (such as the foreshadowed application by Turbo Top to convert 78 spaces to a supermarket).

    79.  The TPB exercised its power under TPO s. 4(1)(b) when it designated the site area in a layout plan as a zone for commercial use. 

    80.  It acted within its power under TPO s. 4(1)(c) when in Notes to the layout plan it reserved 800 car parking spaces in the site for community purposes. 

    81.  In any event, in so reserving 800 spaces, it also acted within the power conferred by the s. 4(1) proviso.  The imposition of the parking space restriction constituted making provision in a layout plan for “any matter whatsoever ... by means of such ... notes or descriptive matter as the Board thinks appropriate”.

    82.  Mr Yu submits that the s. 4(1) proviso should not be interpreted as giving the TPB wider powers than those already conferred by ss. 4(1)(a)-(i).  The s. 4(1) proviso (Mr Yu contends) only stipulates the means (diagrams, illustrations, notes or descriptive matter) by which the TPB can visually or verbally convey the zonings and other matters in ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) on a 2-dimensional layout plan.

    83.  But I do not think that is correct. 

    84.  Mr Yu accepts that the s. 4(1) proviso was enacted to restore what had been the case before Singway. 

    85.  Assume Mr Yu is right that the s. 4(1) proviso only concerns the means by which the TPB can show the matters in ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) on a layout plan.

    86.  Then, in effect, there would be no difference from the position immediately after Leonard J’s judgment in Singway.  On Mr Yu’s argument, ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) would be an exhaustive list of what the TPB could do in a layout plan. The s. 4(1) proviso would have added nothing and its enactment would have been in vain. 

    87.  The initial premise that the s.4(1) proviso restored what was the case before Singway would be contradicted by Mr Yu’s argument.  Consequently, I should not construe the s. 4(1) proviso in the unduly narrow manner which Mr Yu advocates.

    88.  Mr Yu observes that ss. 4(1)(f)-(i) were added to the TPO in 1988 and 1991 after the s. 4(1) proviso was added in 1974.  He asks, if the s. 4(1) proviso introduced a general power in 1974 over and above those enumerated in ss. 4(1)(a)-(e), why was there need to add ss. 4(1)(f)-(i)?  Why not just rely on the supposed general power in the s. 4(1) proviso?

    89.  The answer is to be found, in part at least, in the judgment of Litton JA in R v. Tang Ying Yip [1995] 2 HKC 277 (at 282C):-

    
        “The answer ... is simply this: the powers given by the legislature to the Board have evolved in the course of time, as the scope of responsibility of the Board increased with the growing urbanisation of the territory. The words ‘... and any matter whatsoever ... etc’ were added to s. 4(1) in 1974, to counteract the decision of the High Court in Singway ... Prior to those amendments, the zoning categories ended with para. (f). It would have been highly confusing if, in an effort to increase the powers of the Board, the legislature had deleted paras. (a) to (f), relying simply upon the generality of the additional words ‘... and any matter whatsoever may be shown ... etc’.”
    

    90.  There is a small error in Litton JA’s judgment. He referred to paras. (a)-(f) existing prior to the 1974 amendment of the TPO. In fact, para. (f) was not inserted until 1988.  I do not, however, believe that this error detracts from the thrust of his point. 

    91.  It would have been confusing to have increased the TPB’s powers to counteract Singway, while simultaneously deleting the powers listed in paras. (a)-(e).  Later, despite the existence of the s. 4(1) proviso, it was probably thought convenient to add paras. (f)-(i) to s. 4(1) as the most efficient way of introducing new types of zonings (comprehensive development, country parks, village type development, open storage).  In the absence of clear words to such effect, the addition of the new zonings to s. 4(1) could not have been intended to whittle down the width of the s. 4(1) proviso previously inserted to correct Singway.        

    92.  Second, I doubt that it is helpful pejoratively to label the proposed OZP amendments as the “micro-managing of a specific building”.  I do not think that is an appropriate way of looking at the present case.

    93.  As Mr Mok submits, what the TPB has actually done is to designate an area (the site) as a C(1) zone and to impose a car parking space restriction on that area.  That there currently happens to be a single building or development in the area is only fortuitous.  If (for instance) in the future third parties acquired parts of the site from Turbo Top for the purpose of erecting buildings on the portions so acquired, the same C(1) zoning and parking space restriction would apply to them unless relaxed by the TPB.

    94.  I see nothing in the cases cited by Mr Yu to suggest that the TPB cannot do what is has done by a layout plan of the site area.  In particular, there is nothing in the cases which cuts down the width and plain meaning of the s. 4(1) proviso. 

    95.  In Crozet Briggs CJ expressly stated that the TPB’s powers were “widely drawn ... and must be liberally construed”. Insofar as his obiter remarks about the TPB not including “such matters as the proportions, height and design of buildings” are concerned, Briggs CJ would only have been speaking generally, without any intention that his words should be treated as laying down any rigorous (as opposed to a merely rough and ready) rule. 

    96.  In any case, in reality the instant case concerns the zoning of, and the imposition of a restriction on, an area, regardless of the building or buildings that may be standing there now or in the future. 

    97.  There is the further consideration that, at the time of the decision in Crozet, the s. 4(1) proviso had yet to be added to the TPO.

    98.  It is true that in CC Tse, Cons JA described the Government’s arguments in connection with the s. 4(1) proviso as “doubtful starters”.  But he also made clear that he retained an open mind and was venturing no concluded opinion.

    99.  Cons JA did suggest that in dealing with the expression “types of building” in TPO s. 3(1) one should “look at the building as a building”.  Whatever that cryptic observation might mean, it could not have been intended as a gloss on what the TPB could or could not do in a layout plan within the terms of ss. 4(1)(a)-(i) and the s. 4(1) proviso.  The latter issue is different from the main and alternative arguments which the Court of Appeal considered in CC Tse in relation to TPO s. 3(1).

    100.  In Wing On Godfrey JA was drawing a general distinction between the functions of the TPB and the Building Authority.  It is unlikely that, by simply quoting the Building Appeal Tribunal with approval, he was intending to pronounce a hard and fast rule.  All he did was to draw a “broad brush” distinction between what the TPB and the Building Authority do. His dictum was intended to provide no more than a rule of thumb or common sense guidance.

    101.  In any case, Godfrey JA pointed that the TPB was essentially “concerned with planning considerations for a particular zone or area”.  That is what we are concerned with here.

    102.  Third, I find no relevant ambiguity in TPO ss. 3(1) or 4(1).  I therefore do not see how I can be assisted in construing the ambit of those provisions by reference to the abortive Town Planning Bill 2000.

    103.  Little can be inferred from the mere fact that the 2000 Bill was more specific in its enumeration of the TPB’s powers.  That more detailed enumeration, for example, might equally plausibly have been intended just to make crystal clear what is already sufficiently explicit in the TPO. 

    104.  Moreover, I do not think that the failure to pass the 2000 Bill logically implies (and can only imply) a tacit acceptance by the Government of particular limitations in the TPB’s powers.

    105.  Given the absence of ambiguity in the TPO’s provisions, it follows that the TPB has not here deprived Turbo Top of property rights.  Zoning may place restrictions on the uses to which a property can be put.  But zoning restrictions imposed in the public interest will not without more amount to a deprivation of property.  This is because when one acquires land, one takes the property subject to an implied condition that, for the public good, the Government may by regulation (including OZPs) limit the uses to which such land can be put in the future.

    106.  Fourth, I do not believe that there is anything unworkable about the requirement of a minimum of 800 parking spaces. 

    107.  Mr Yu’s rhetorical question assumes that the TPB imposes a requirement that there be at least 800 public car parking spaces in an area where currently there is not that number of parking spaces.  He then asks whether and (if so) why the first person to develop the site after the imposition of the requirement must bear the entire burden of making up the deficiency in car parking spaces. 

    108.  But Mr Yu’s assumption does not conform with the present situation.  Here the TPB has acknowledged the existence of 800 re-provisioned spaces and by its amendments to the OZP sought to ensure that at least that number (subject to minor relaxation) will be available to the public in the future at the site. 

    109.  Assume that third parties take over all or parts of the site from Turbo Top.  If any of those parties intends to develop a part of the site in a manner that reduces the 800 existing spaces, such party will have to apply to the TPB under TPO s. 16 for permission to do so. It does not appear that there is anything intrinsically unworkable about such a requirement.

    110.  Fifth, in oral submission, Mr Yu drew my attention to TPO s. 4A(1) which deals with the comprehensive development area zoning introduced in s. 4(1)(f). TPO s. 4A provides:-

    
        “(1) Without restricting what the Board may, under sections 3 and 4, show or make provision for in a plan, the Board may, by a note on the plan, in respect of a comprehensive development area, prohibit the undertaking of any building works, as defined in the Building Ordinance (Cap. 123), except:-

		
			(a) as specified in the note; or

			(b) with the permission of the Board, which permission may be granted by reference to a plan approved by the Board under subsection (2).”
		
    

    111.  Mr Yu suggested that, in contrast to s. 4(1), TPO s. 4A(1) allowed the TPB to impose restrictions on a specific building within a comprehensive development area zone.  But if that is right, then it seems to me that Mr Yu’s argument is undermined. 

    112.  To begin with, any power conferred by s. 4A(1) would on Mr Yu’s case have to be exercised in accordance with the purpose to the TPO as stipulated in its long title.  That purpose in the long title (Mr Yu argues) does not allow for the imposition by the TPB of restrictions on a specific building (as opposed to a particular area).  But, if that is so, how can the TPB impose, consistently with the long title, restrictions on a specific building under s. 4A(1)? The TPB could only so act if its raison d’etre (as defined by the TPO’s long title) enabled it to do so. That the TPB may (as it undoubtedly can) “micro-manage” in relation to a specific building under s. 4A(1), implies that Mr Yu’s narrow reading of the scope of the long title is wrong.

    113.  My reasoning is fortified by the subordinate clause which begins s. 4A(1).  Nothing in s. 4A(1) is to be treated as diminishing the Board’s wide powers under TPO ss. 3(1) and 4(1).  Thus, if the TPB can “micro-manage” by imposing a restriction (say) on a particular building in a comprehensive development area under s. 4A(1), the TPB must be able to do similarly in relation to other zonings under s. 4(1).

    C. Complaint (2): Inconsistency

    114.  The result of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd decisions is an OZP with a Schedule of Uses that in Column 1 of its “Commercial” section identifies “Uses always permitted” within the site.   Such uses listed under Column 1 include, for instance, “Shop and Services”. 

    115.  But the “Commercial” section also contains “Remarks” which (among other things) impose a requirement (subject to minor relaxation) that there be a minimum of 800 public car parking spaces at the site.

    116.  Mr Yu submits that there is an internal inconsistency within the “Commercial” section.  On the one hand, according to Column 1, a property owner can always use the site for purposes listed in Column 1 without seeking TPB permission.  On the other hand, if an intended Column 1 use will lead to a reduction in the 800 car parking spaces, the owner must seek the TPB’s permission for a relaxation.  The Column 1 use in such case would not be “always permitted”.  Thus, the “Uses always permitted” designation of Column 1 is contradicted by the “Remarks”.  That (Mr Yu submits) is irrational.

    117.  I disagree.  There is no irrational inconsistency.

    118.  The OZP is a statutory instrument and, like all statutes, must be construed in a way that will make sense of it as a whole. One cannot read a part of the OZP in isolation from the rest.

    119.  Self-evidently, the Column 1 description of “always permitted” is to be read as qualified by the “Remarks”.  To the extent that a Column 1 use does not contravene the “Remarks,” then to that extent the use may be regarded as “always permitted” and no reference to the TPB needs to be made.

    D. Complaint (3): Irrelevant or erroneous considerations taken into account

    120.  Mr Yu complains that in zoning the site C(1) “to reflect the completed development on the site” the TPB abdicated its responsibility of planning for the future.  Planning involves providing for the future.  In contrast, Mr Yu contends that “reflecting the completed development” solely entails looking to the past. 

    121.  Mr Yu adds that the existing development at the site was not the result of the exercise by the TPB of a planning judgment. There was no requirement (Mr Yu says) for Turbo Top to apply for TPB permission to build CKC and its ancillary structures.  Planning permission was only sought as a public relations exercise to placate the Government which was insisting that Turbo Top apply to the TPB.

    122.  I am unable to accept Mr Yu’s argument.

    123.  Even if Turbo Top only went through the motions of applying for TPB permission for public relations reasons, Turbo Top must be held bound by the statements and representations which it made in its application.  The Court cannot ignore the fact that an application to the TPB was made at the time and that the TPB assessed from a planning perspective whether the CKC development was appropriate.  The building of CKC must have involved planning considerations on the part of the TPB.

    124.  Nor do I understand why the recognition by the TPB of the state of affairs which had been achieved through the development of CKC at the site should involve an “abdication” of planning responsibilities. In proposing amendments to the OZP, the TPB was confirming the reality of an existing state of affairs at the site as the starting point for any future development of the area.  In so doing, the TPB would have been looking not just to the past, but also to the future.  

    125.  Mr Yu further complains that, in coming to its decisions, the TPB acted on the views of Transport Department (as conveyed to the TPB by its Secretary).  Those views were to the effect that “taking into account the imminent developments/redevelopments in Central,” it would be prudent keep the 78 public parking spaces which Turbo Top wished to convert into a supermarket.   

    126.  Mr Yu says that, to the extent that the TPB acted upon Transport Department’s views, the TPB would have taken into account irrelevant or erroneous considerations. 

    127.  Mr Yu argues that no consideration has ever been given to the appropriate number of parking spaces required in the site area. The only available study, that commissioned by Turbo Top for the purposes of its proposal to convert 78 spaces into a supermarket, suggests that the 800 currently available public spaces are under-utilised.

    128.  Mr Yu submits that, if the TPB wished to act upon Transport Department’s views, it ought first to have investigated whether those views were justified.  It could not simply have acted on the views on the assertion of the Transport Department.  Insofar as the TPB did nothing to verify the views, the TPB acted in a way that was unfair to Turbo Top.

    129.  As I indicated to Mr Yu during oral submission, it seems on the evidence that the TPB did not place any weight on the Transport Department’s views in coming to its decisions.  Instead, the TPB focused on the fact that the CKC development entailed a re-provisioning of the pre-existing 800 public spaces at the Garden Road car park.  The TPB’s decisions treated the re-provisioned parking spaces as a public asset which should be preserved, subject to minor relaxation.

    130.  Consequently, it is unnecessary to consider whether, in taking account of Transport Department’s views, the TPB wrongly conducted itself.  The TPB took no account of the Transport Department’s views in coming to its decisions.  Mr Mok did not strongly resist this conclusion in the course of his submissions.

    131.  But I do not accept Mr Yu’s still further suggestion that, in focusing on the re-provisioning of the 800 spaces, the TPB also acted outside its remit.  In my view, the TPB was fully entitled in the exercise of its planning functions to treat the 800 spaces as a public asset which should be preserved for the future benefit of the area. 

    132.  The spaces may currently be under-utilised.  But prudent planning strategy can include the preservation of an existing feature to meet unknown or unexpected contingencies, even where the feature may not be much used or appreciated at the moment.

    E. Complaint (4): Procedural irregularity in the 3rd decision

    133.  The 3rd decision removed the GFA restriction on the 800 car parking spaces.  The TPB decided this of its own motion without first informing Turbo Top or giving it the opportunity to be heard on that matter.  Mr Yu says this was procedurally unfair.  Had it been informed, Turbo Top argues that it could have submitted that the whole car parking restriction should have been removed.

    134.  There is nothing in this point. 

    135.  By the 1st and 2nd decisions the TPB had already decided not to remove the car parking restriction.  At its meeting on 13 May 2011 the TPB’s Secretary pointed out that, as a matter of practice, where the TPB had imposed a minimum number of car parking spaces on an area, the TPB did not also impose a minimum GFA for the car parking spaces.  The TPB accordingly deleted the car parking GFA restriction to conform with its past practice. There is no unfairness in that.

    136.  Mr Yu suggests that on one reading of the minutes of the TPB’s 13 May 2011 meeting the Secretary pointed out something other than what I have just stated.  But I do not accept that Mr Yu’s interpretation of the minutes is the correct or natural reading.

    F. Complaint (5): Discriminatory treatment

    137.  The criticism is that the TPB did not impose an analogous parking requirement in the IFC site.  Nevertheless, the TPB deleted the GFA retail restriction in the CKC site because there was no retail restriction in the IFC site.  So (Mr Yu concludes) the IFC and CKC sites have not been treated in like manner.

    138.  I do not find this a compelling point. Comparing the IFC and CKC developments is akin to comparing apples and oranges.  What is true of one site would not necessarily be true or applicable to the other.

    139.  It is correct that the TPB deleted the GFA retail restriction for the CKC on the basis that there was no such in the IFC. But it does not follow that the omission or imposition of any restriction in the IFC should also be mirrored in the CKC site. 

    140.  The IFC scheme was one for mixed uses (office, hotel and retail).  In contrast, the CKC site was intended for office and car park, with limited retail space (no more than 680 sq m).  It is not therefore possible meaningfully to compare one development with the other and conclude that, because one has or does not have some restriction, there has been arbitrary or unfair discrimination in respect of the other.

    G. Miscellaneous complaints

    141.  I deal here with 2 minor complaints made by Turbo Top.

    142.  In its Notice for Judicial Review, Turbo Top criticises the TPB for failing to rectify the discrepancy between the C(1) zone boundary shown in the OZP and the actual CKC site boundary.  This criticism is unjustified.  The OZP is a “broad brush” plan drawn on a small scale (1:5000). No material confusion could result from the slight discrepancies between the OZP and the actual site boundary.

    143.  Turbo Top also complains that the reasons for the TPB’s decisions here typically follow wording found in briefing papers prepared by the Planning Department for the TPB.  In my view, such tracking of wording merely reflects general practice.  The tracking does not necessarily mean that the TPB failed to give independent consideration to the representations before it.  On the contrary, in this case, the minutes of the TPB’s meetings show that members actively engaged in discussion of the matters before them before arriving at their independent conclusions.

    H. Summary

    144.  The long title to the TPO and ss. 3(1) and 4(1) therein (including the s. 4(1) proviso) are “widely drawn and must be construed liberally”. There is no ambiguity in their extent as far as this case is concerned.  The provisions read in their ordinary and natural meaning are wide enough to empower the TPB to zone the site as C(1) and impose an 800 public parking space restriction on that area.  There has been no encroachment on the jurisdiction of the Building Authority. 

    145.  There is no inconsistency within the Explanatory Statement of the draft amended OZP.  Nor has there been any abdication of responsibility, improper consideration, or procedural unfairness in the manner in which the TPB has conducted itself here.

    146.  Finally, there is no compelling case of discriminatory conduct on the part of the TPB as far as the treatment of the CKC and IFC are concerned.               

    IV. CONCLUSION

    147.  The judicial reviews in HCAL 23 and 52 fail. They are dismissed.

    148.  The interim stays of the submission to the Chief Executive in Council of the draft amended OZP which I previously ordered are to be lifted.  But such lifting is not to come into effect for 7 days from this Judgment in order to give Turbo Top time to consider whether to apply for an interim stay of the lifting pending appeal.  If Turbo Top applies within those 7 days for an interim stay, the lifting is to be further stayed pending consideration of Turbo Top’s application.  Any such application by Turbo Top for an interim stay pending appeal should be listed before me to be heard at the soonest possible opportunity (estimated length 30 minutes).  If necessary, to accommodate at least one counsel on each side, the application can be listed for hearing at 4.30 pm.

    149.  There will be an Order Nisi that Turbo Top pay the TPB’s costs of both judicial reviews (including any reserved costs), such costs to be taxed if not agreed.  There will be certificate for 2 counsel.

    150.  There will be liberty to apply.

Cur Adv Vult
For the purpose of this trial, two actions, namely, Admiralty in Rem No 426/96 and Suit No 1196/96, were consolidated. In the first action, the plaintiffs, who are ship repairers, claimed from the defendants the cost of services and materials provided at their shipyard in Jurong with respect to the defendants` vessel, `The Wilson Ruby`. In Suit No 1196/96, the defendants in the first action sued the plaintiffs in the first action for loss or damage arising from a fire on the vessel while she was at the plaintiffs` shipyard. The defendants in the first action claimed to have suffered losses amounting to US$4,322,426.14. They also sought a declaration that the plaintiffs in the first action are to indemnify them against any liability for salvage incurred by them in connection with the said fire on the vessel as well as any liability incurred by them to, inter alia, the Port of Singapore Authority and the owners of `The Donna Christina`, a vessel which was beside The Wilson Ruby at the time of the fire. For convenience, the plaintiffs in the first action will be referred to as the `plaintiffs` throughout this judgment although they are the defendants in Suit No 1196/96. For the same reason, the defendants in the first action will be referred to as the `defendants` throughout this judgment even though they are the plaintiffs in Suit No 1196/96.
 2.On 18 January 1996, the defendants sent The Wilson Ruby to the plaintiffs` shipyard for repairs to be effected. The vessel, an LPG carrier, was then out of class and repairs were intended to put her back into class. In the main, the plaintiffs were asked to undertake the task of steel renewal, overhaul the cargo pumps, cargo tank safety valves, condensers and deep-well cargo pumps, and handle some other mechanical engineering work with respect to, inter alia, the tail shaft and propellers. For the work which was done, the plaintiffs submitted an invoice for $786,620.28. To date, this amount has not been paid and the plaintiffs are claiming this sum as well as interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the basis that this was the agreed contractual rate of interest. Apart from this sum, the plaintiffs are also claiming the sum of $350,050 with respect to general services rendered after The Wilson Ruby was badly damaged by fire on 25 February 1996.
 3.During the trial, counsel for the defendants accepted that the sums of $786,620.28 and $350,050 claimed by the plaintiffs were due to them. He submitted that the defendants were not obliged to pay the sums claimed because the plaintiffs were liable to the defendants for a much larger amount for the damage and losses incurred as a result of the fire on their vessel. In view of this clarification of the defendants` position, all that is left to be considered, apart from the issue of interest, is whether the plaintiffs are in any way liable to the defendants for the fire which occurred on The Wilson Ruby on 25 February 1996.
 4.
 Bailment and onus of proof
At the outset, the defendants contended that their rights and liabilities and those of the plaintiffs should be determined on the basis that the plaintiffs were the bailees of The Wilson Ruby while she was at the shipyard. The advantage sought by the defendants in asserting that the plaintiffs were bailees who failed and/or neglected to take reasonable care of The Wilson Ruby is obvious for the position of a bailee was summed up by Atkin LJ in 
The Ruapehu
 
[1925] Lloyd LR 311
, p 315 in the following terms: 
This bailee has to show that the loss was not occasioned by the absence of reasonable care and skill. This he may do by showing that he took all reasonable precautions, but if he has to admit or is convicted of some act of negligence, then the rule necessarily requires him to show that the loss was not caused by that act or negligence.
 5.The plaintiffs countered that for the purpose of considering the question of bailment, it must be noted that while the vessel was at the plaintiffs` shipyard, the defendants had a number of officers and crew on the vessel and they carried out maintenance and repair work. Furthermore, the defendants employed other contractors to carry out specified repairs on the vessel while she was in the shipyard. These other contractors were involved in repairing, among other things, the vessel`s auxiliary engines and inert gas system. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs contended that the duty imposed on them with respect to the care of the vessel had been modified. The plaintiffs` contentions are not without merit. After all, in 
The Ruapehu
 
[1925] Lloyd LR 311
, p 315, Atkin LJ, whose views were relied upon by the defendants, went on to say as follows: 
How far is the position altered by the presence of the owners` servants? I do not think that the rights reserved to the owners to retain the use of the vessel for certain purposes prevents the transaction from being one of bailment; but I think that the principle of onus of proof must in such a case be modified though not destroyed.
 In similar vein, in a Canadian case, 
 R v Halifax Shipyards Ltd 
 (1956) 4 DLR (2d) 566, p 575, Thorson J pointed out: 
Where a ship has been delivered to a ship repairer for the making of repairs to her, and the ship repairer`s possession of her is not exclusive by reason of the fact that the ship`s crew remains on board during the course of the repairs as a matter of right and the ship is damaged while undergoing the repairs, the ordinary rule that the onus of proof that the damage was not due to negligence on the part of the ship repairer`s employees lies on the ship repairer applies only in cases where the damage originated during the period of working hours when the ship repairer`s employees were in charge and does not apply in cases where the damage originated during the period when the only persons on the ship were members of the ship`s crew.
 6.Although the plaintiffs` approach is preferred, I need not, for reasons which will be evident later on, consider the question of bailment at length. All that needs to be said here is that the question of bailment will be referred to again after the cause of the fire on The Wilson Ruby has been determined.
 7.
 Events on the day of the fire
For a better picture of the conflicting views as to what caused the fire on The Wilson Ruby on 25 February 1996, the events that took place on board the vessel on the day of the fire ought to be mentioned. Evidently, some hot work, which involved the use of an oxy-acetylene cutting torch, was done on board the vessel by the defendants themselves on that day. This was not denied by the defendants, who said that all such hot work ceased by 2.30pm. It also cannot be disputed that the defendants` oxy-acetylene cutting torch was defective in that there was no flashback arrestor at the inlet of the cutting torch. This was a serious violation of the Factories (Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing) Regulations. Equally disturbing is the fact that the defendants` hot work was done without authority because under the safety rules in place at the shipyard, hot work, which includes welding, flame-cutting or burning and any other work involving the use or generation of heat or the production of sparks, cannot be done without a permit. No such permit was applied for. The purpose of requiring such a permit is to enable all parties concerned to take adequate safety measures during the duration of the hot work. The defendants must thus, at the outset, be taken to task for failing to apply for a permit for the hot work done by them on the day of the fire and for using a gas cutting torch without a flashback arrestor at its inlet.
 8.
 Place where the fire started
Both the plaintiffs and defendants agreed that the fire started in the gas cylinder room (hereinafter referred to as the `bottle room`) of The Wilson Ruby and that it spread rapidly from that room to the entire superstructure of the vessel. However, they disagreed on the cause of the fire.
 9.Before the different views as to how the fire began are considered, a few words ought to be said about the vessel`s bottle room. This is a small storage room where cylinders of gas, including oxygen and acetylene, were kept. Oxygen and acetylene were fed from the bottle room to the engine room through fixed pipes in the engine room. The pipe passed from the aft of the bottle room and into the engine room. The bottle room had a door and a port hole. It also had an ordinary air vent as well as a mechanical ventilator. The cowling of the mechanical ventilator was slightly damaged while the vessel was undergoing an inclining or stability test on 16 February 1996. Whether the mechanical ventilator was in a working condition before it was damaged is an unanswered question. What is clear is that the cowling of the mechanical ventilator had not been repaired on the day of the fire.
 10.
 The plaintiffs` view on the cause of the fire
The plaintiffs contended that they were not liable to the defendants for the fire on The Wilson Ruby on 25 February 1996 because the fire would not have occurred if the defendants had not undertaken any unauthorised hot work just before the fire started. They pointed out that the cause of the fire may be traced to the defendants` defective cutting torch, which should, as was required by law, have had a flashback arrestor at the inlet. In their view, the defective cutting torch permitted a flashback to occur when it was used just before the fire which badly damaged The Wilson Ruby broke out. A `flashback` refers to the movement of a flame backwards through the cutting torch and into one of its gas hoses. In such a case, the flame may even enter the gas cylinder if the flashback arrestor is missing. The plaintiffs submitted that the flashback in question took place in the oxygen gas supply line of the oxy-acetylene cutting torch and that the explosion and fire in the bottle room occurred as a result of the formation and ignition of a flammable mixture of acetylene and oxygen in the oxygen pipeline and in an oxygen cylinder in the bottle room.
 11.The plaintiffs` view on how the fire started is supported by the Ministry of Labour investigation report on the fire and explosion at the shipyard. The relevant part of the report, which was issued on 30 August 1996, stated as follows: 
Based on the results obtained from the experiment conducted on the oxy-acetylene gas cutting torch and the flashback arrestors , it can be concluded that a flashback had taken place inside the oxygen gas supply line of the oxy-acetylene gas cutting torch. [T]he back fire burnt rapidly back in the oxygen gas supply line. The back fire generated an intensive back pressure inside the oxygen gas supply line and subsequently broke the sinter material and jammed the valve inside the oxygen gas flashback arrestor fitted at the outlet of the gas manifolds located at the wall of the engine room. The back fire also created a blow hole on the gas tubing at the inlet side of the oxygen gas flashback arrestor. The flashback was believed to proceed all the way through the entire oxygen gas supply line and subsequently shattered the oxygen gas cylinder. The powerful explosion had damaged the adjacent gas cylinders inside the gas cylinder storage room. A fire broke out and spread rapidly throughout the entire superstructure area of the vessel.
 12.A few words ought to be said about the experiment conducted on the oxy-acetylene cutting torch. This test revealed that the acetylene gas regulating valve and the oxygen gas regulating valve were leaking. Furthermore, the flame of the cutting torch was not smooth and the flame could not be throttled by the regulating valves. These findings helped Mr Pang Suh Ju, the engineer charged with the task of investigating the fire and explosion in question, to ascertain the cause of the fire. The defendants sought to discredit these test results by pointing to a Det Norske Veritas report in June 1997 on the results of a test on the cutting torch, which was conducted at their request. This test showed that the flame torch functioned satisfactorily without any leakage. It must be noted that this test was conducted many months after the fire and, as the plaintiffs` counsel pointed out, there is no guarantee that the equipment was not cleaned before it was sent to Det Norske Veritas. In contrast, the test initiated by Mr Pang was an independent test on the cutting torch. Admittedly, Mr Pang could have provided clearer answers to questions asked during cross-examination. All the same, the thrust of his report was not undermined.
 13.The conclusions reached in the Ministry of Labour investigation report were supported by the plaintiffs` expert witness, Mr David Robbins, who specialises in the scientific investigation of fires and explosions. He had no doubt that the explosion in the bottle room was due to the ignition of a mixture of acetylene and oxygen within the oxy-acetylene cutting equipment. He stated in his affidavit that there were a number of features in the physical evidence which were significant in this regard. These were the holes present in the oxygen hose in the engine room, the shattered flashback arrestor in the oxygen line, and the fragmented oxygen cylinder. In his view, the first two features indicated that there was a powerful flashback in the oxygen side of the equipment in the engine room while the numerous holes along the oxygen hose indicated that the combustion event within it was close to, or at, detonation speeds. In Mr Robbins` view, the flashback could only have occurred due to the presence of acetylene in the oxygen line. As for how acetylene got into the oxygen cylinder, he explained that it was relevant that the valves on the blow pipe of the cutting torch were found to be leaking when they were tested. The blow pipe nozzle was partially blocked and the oxygen regulator was found to allow a back flow of gas. If the main valves at the manifold were not closed after the last job, acetylene gas could have passed from the acetylene side of the equipment through the leaking valves into the oxygen side of the equipment, and eventually into the oxygen cylinder in the bottle room through the defective regulator. As for how the flammable mixture of acetylene and oxygen was ignited, Mr Robbins said that there was only one plausible means of ignition. As the oxy-acetylene equipment comprised, in effect, a closed system with only one opening at the nozzle of the blow pipe, ignition could only have occurred at that point when someone attempted to light the blow pipe, prior to commencing further hot work.
 14.As for the third feature referred to, namely, the fact that the first oxygen cylinder in the bottle room to explode (hereinafter referred to as `cylinder A`) was broken into a large number of small pieces, Mr Robbins said that this was evidence that the explosion was the result of a flashback which propagated to the oxygen cylinder in question. In contrast, two other gas cylinders in the bottle room had fish-mouth opening fractures while a fourth gas cylinder in the bottle room buckled in and fractured near the bottom section. Referring to cylinder A, Mr Robbins explained in his affidavit: 
The pattern of damage to the fragmented oxygen cylinder is unique amongst the cylinders in the bottle store, and is in any case a most unusual pattern of damage to an oxygen cylinder involved in a fire. The fragmentation into small pieces and the deformation of the two end sections which were recovered is typical of that caused by a detonation type explosion within the cylinder. The manner in which the cylinder exploded cannot, I consider, be satisfactorily accounted for as a result of it rupturing due to external fire attack. In such cases where cylinders are heated and ruptured due to the increase in internal pressure caused by an external fire, the cylinders usually show less destructive, burst-type damage (as that shown by two of the other oxygen cylinders in the bottle store) or they may fragment into a small number of large pieces as the internal over-pressure is relieved (as shown by a third oxygen cylinder). The fragmentation of the oxygen cylinder into a large number of small pieces also suggests that the event occurred at a low temperature which cannot be readily explained as an effect of the fire. The pattern of explosion damage to the cylinder cannot, therefore, readily be attributed to an explosion occurring elsewhere in the bottle store.
 15.
 The defendants` view on the cause of the fire
The defendants, who denied that the cause of the fire on The Wilson Ruby on 25 February 1996 may be traced to their use of a defective oxy-acetylene torch for unauthorised hot work and to a flashback which reached cylinder A and caused it to explode, took an entirely different view as to how the fire in the bottle room occurred. While the plaintiffs submitted that the damage to the cowling of the mechanical ventilator of the bottle room had nothing to do with the fire, the defendants contended that an investigation into the cause of the fire ought to take into account the fact that the said mechanical ventilator was damaged during an inclining/stability test on the vessel on 16 February 1996. They submitted that after the mechanical ventilator was damaged, the plaintiffs failed to provide proper and adequate alternative ventilation for the bottle room and/or failed to repair the mechanical ventilator in the bottle room in good time. This failure allowed leaking acetylene to accumulate in the bottle room to such an extent that it ignited. To the defendants, it was this fire in the bottle room which heated cylinder A and caused it to explode. As such, they took the view that the plaintiffs were liable to them for the consequences of the fire.
 16.An analysis of the defendants` case will reveal that the defendants alleged the following: (a). that there was an accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room;
 (b). that the plaintiffs failed to avert the accumulation of the acetylene gas; and
 (c). that there was an ignition of the acetylene gas, which caused the oxygen cylinder to explode.
 The defendants` case, in so far as it is based on an accumulation of acetylene in the bottle room, a failure on the part of the plaintiffs to prevent the accumulation of the gas and an ignition of the accumulated gas, is flawed for a number of reasons. To begin with, it has not been established that there had been an accumulation of acetylene in the bottle room as a result of a leakage of the gas. Mr M Sivasamy, the chief engineer of The Wilson Ruby and its most senior officer, testified that he kept the bottle room door open. Another of the defendants` witnesses, Mr Deepak Pandit, the defendants` superintendent, said that on a number of occasions, he noticed that the bottle room door was not closed. If the door had been left open and the fact that the room has a natural air vent is taken into account, the probability of an accumulation of acetylene gas would have been rather remote. In any case, if there had been an accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room, this would have been noticed by anyone going into the room, and certainly by Mr Shetty, the fitter who undertook the hot work on the day of the fire. He must have gone into the bottle room on that day to release the relevant valves before he could do any hot work. Mr Shetty did not allege that he noticed an accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room on the day of the fire.
 17.Even if there had been an accumulation of gas, it has not been established that the plaintiffs were responsible in any way for the accumulation. The defendants blamed the plaintiffs for the alleged accumulation of gas because the plaintiffs had not repaired the cowling of the mechanical ventilator, which could have got rid of accumulated gas. To begin with, a question arises as to whether the mechanical ventilator was in a working condition before it was slightly damaged on 16 February 1996. The plaintiffs` witnesses, Mr Ng Ban Kang, an electrical supervisor at the shipyard, and Mr Mathalikannu James, a ship-repair supervisor at the shipyard, said that although they passed by the bottle room frequently, they had never heard the motor of the mechanical ventilator running. Mr Mathalikannu James` evidence was as follows: 
Q: Did you test whether the fan was working after the damage? 
A: No. I was told by Chiang [the project leader] to look first. It was slightly tilted. Since it was a small dent, do we need to repair? Chief engineer of the ship told me tojust fare it. I did not see that the fan was working at that time. 
Q: How did you know that it was not working? 
A: Because I did not hear any noise. The chief engineer went with me to see it together. I told him that it could not be repaired on the site. He said you leave it as it is and I will talk to Pandit [the superintendent] whether it needs to be repaired or leave it as it is.
 18.Furthermore, Mr Ng Ban Kang said that it was evident from the photographs of the mechanical ventilator that it was in a poor condition. In fact, he was not sure if it could have worked before it was damaged. Another witness, Mr Chiang Cher Moh, who went on board the vessel daily as he was the project leader in charge of the repair project, also shed some light on the condition of the mechanical ventilator. He explained that the delay in repairing the mechanical ventilator was due to the fact that the internal parts were so very badly corroded that he waited for confirmation on whether it should be repaired or renewed. The following paragraph from his affidavit shows just how much Mr M Sivasamy, the defendants` chief engineer, knew about the working of the mechanical ventilator: 
On 17 February 1996 morning, I called the chief engineer to determine whether the fan motor was working before the damage as I was concerned that the owner may make a claim against the yard. The chief engineer himself was not sure. I asked him to switch on the fan motor to check but he was unable to find the switch.
 19.Apart from the fact that it is not clear whether the mechanical ventilator was in a working condition before it was damaged, a question arises as to whether the defendants were indeed concerned about a possible accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room either before or after the cowling of the mechanical ventilator had been damaged. The facts prove the contrary. To begin with, the defendants` chief engineer, Mr M Sivasamy, who was the most senior officer on board the vessel, failed to declare that there were cylinders of flammable gas in the bottle room when he submitted a ship`s flammable declaration form to the shipyard`s safety department on 18 January 1996. More cylinders of gas were brought into the bottle room while the vessel was in the shipyard and the defendants missed yet another opportunity to put the shipyard on notice that there was flammable gas in the bottle room. Having not alerted the plaintiffs in the manner required, Mr M Sivasamy nonetheless tried to shift some blame to the plaintiffs when he stated in his affidavit that at a meeting of the Vessel Safety Co-ordinating Committee (hereinafter referred to as `VSCC`) on 18 February 1996, he emphasised to Mr Chiang Cher Moh, the project leader in charge of the repair project, `that the flammable nature of the gas in the room made it necessary for the mechanical ventilator to be functional at the earliest`. He also said that he reminded Mr Chiang Cher Moh at a meeting on 19 February 1996 to fix the mechanical ventilator. His evidence is clearly flawed. Apart from the fact that Mr Chiang Cher Moh denied that the said conversations took place, there was no VSCC meeting on 18 February 1996. Furthermore, Mr Chiang Cher Moh was already on leave on 18 February 1996 and he did not return to the shipyard until 23 February 1996. As such, Mr M Sivasamy could not have reminded Mr Chiang Cher Moh to have the mechanical ventilator repaired on 19 February 1996.
 20.If all the facts are closely examined, it is clear that if there was negligence on the part of anyone, it was negligence on the part of the defendants themselves. If Mr M Sivasamy was, as he claimed, very worried about the problem of accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room, he certainly failed to take steps to organise the equipment in the bottle room properly or to have the room properly ventilated. Apart from the fact that there were instances of a mixture of left and right-handed threaded fittings for the oxy-acetylene equipment, there was an acetylene cylinder which was painted in the colour usually associated with oxygen cylinders. As for the ventilation of the bottle room, Mr M Sivasamy, who claimed that he kept the bottle room door open, did not know that the bottle room had a port hole which could also have been opened. It is evident that if the bottle room door and the port hole had been left open, then cross ventilation and the natural air vent in the bottle room would have prevented an accumulation of acetylene or ensured that it would not have accumulated to the extent alleged by the defendants.
 21.Mr M Sivasamy also admitted that he failed to inform Mr Ravi, the gas engineer, to whom he handed over his duties when he went on leave on 22 February 1996, about the danger posed by a possible accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room because the mechanical ventilator had not been repaired. Mr M Sivasamy`s answers during cross-examination certainly did not help the defendants` case. When questioned, he said: 
Q: When you left the ship on 22 February, did you ask the gas engineer to continue to monitor the bottle room for accumulation of gas? 
A: Nothing specific about the bottle room except that the shipyard has to repair the mechanical ventilator. 
Q: You failed to appoint a safety co-ordinator. You failed to tell anyone about the bottle room when you went on leave. You failed to ensure proper ventilation. If there was an accumulation of gases, you and the persons who took over from you after you went on leave could have prevented it. You accept that. 
A: Yes.
 22.It must also be noted that if there had been a leakage of acetylene, the defendants were negligent in failing to notice it. Mr M Sivasamy conceded that if there was an acetylene leak, any person who went into the bottle room to release the valves so that the cutting torch could be used would have detected it. Another witness, Mr Jude Illango, the third engineer of The Wilson Ruby, who supervised the cutting work by Mr Shetty, the fitter on the day of the fire, also accepted that he should have checked the bottle room for leakage of acetylene on the day of the fire. When cross-examined, his answers were as follows: 
Q: Having decided to do an illegal act, what steps did you take to ensure that everything was safe; go to the bottle room to check? 
A: There was a fire extinguisher nearby and I kept a bucket of water. 
Q: Did you go to the bottle room to check if there were leaks? 
A: Fitters were cutting regularly. 
Q: Should you have checked the bottle room? 
A: I should have done that. 
Q: You should have ensured proper ventilation in the room. Did you know that the mechanical ventilator was not working? 
A: No.
 In the circumstances, even if there had been an accumulation of acetylene gas in the bottle room as a result of leakage, the plaintiffs are not responsible for the said accumulation.
 23.The third reason why the defendants` case with respect to the cause of the fire is flawed is that even if there had been an accumulation of gas in the bottle room, it has not been established that the cause of the fire which damaged the vessel was the ignition of the accumulated gas. The defendants` expert witness, Dr Abraham Koshy, who considered and ruled out the possibility of a flashback causing the explosion in the bottle room, said that the key evidence that a fire occurred prior to any explosion in the bottle room was obtained from the results of metallurgical tests conducted on the damaged cylinders from the bottle room. He asserted that these tests showed that all the damaged oxygen cylinders had undergone significant changes in their microstructures. In his view, the cause for these changes was a high intensity fire from an external source. Dr Koshy also relied on hardness tests conducted on fragments of the shattered gas cylinders in the bottle room. According to him, these tests showed that the hardness values of the damaged cylinders were high in comparison to a new unaffected cylinder. The highest value observed on a fragment of cylinder A was 319 Hv on the Vickers scale whereas the average value for a new unaffected cylinder was only 245 Hv. He pointed out that as it was the presence of martensite that significantly increased the hardness of the shattered cylinder fragments, the presence of large amounts of martensite in the oxygen cylinder which first exploded, namely, cylinder A, indicated that it was subjected to heat of at least 840[deg ]C and then subjected to rapid cooling and quenching after the explosion. He thus concluded that there must have been a leakage and build-up of acetylene gas before the explosion. As acetylene is a very unstable gas, he suggested that the heat from the sun`s rays on the day of the fire could have raised the temperature of the bulkheads of the bottle room to such an extent that the acetylene gas was ignited.
 24.Dr Koshy`s evidence is not convincing. To begin with, he submitted two reports on the metallurgical phase changes in the nature of fragments of cylinder A. The first, a report by Det Norske Veritas, did not appear to support his case. When this was pointed out to him, Dr Koshy sought to rely on the other report by a Dr Manoj Gupta from the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering at the National University of Singapore. However, this report does not lend credence to Dr Koshy`s assertions as its thrust was rebutted by the plaintiffs` other expert witness, Dr Thomas Parry, a metallurgist, who pointed out that the metallurgical evidence from the microstructures of the metal samples recovered from the scene of the incident does not support the hypothesis that a fire occurred in the bottle room before the explosion on 25 February 1996. Dr Parry, who disagreed with Dr Koshy`s assertion that the values of the hardness measured from cylinder remnants were high relative to that of a new unaffected cylinder, said that evidence of the presence of martensite provided no information as to when this phase was formed. All the same, he thought that the most likely explanation for the presence of martensite within the samples examined from, inter alia, cylinder A would be that this is an artefact of normal heat treatment received during manufacture. Dr Parry also pointed out that the principal requirement for the formation of martensite is rapid cooling after it has been heated to the required temperature and he was not sure what was the source of quenching and rapid cooling in Dr Koshy`s scenario. Dr Koshy replied that the quenching of the fragments occurred when cool air rushed into the bottle room after the explosion. It is difficult to believe that this was the case.
 25.Equally damaging to Dr Koshy`s assertions is the fact that the defendants` other expert witness, Mr Barry Dillon, a metallurgist, supported Dr Parry`s conclusions and disagreed with Dr Koshy and Dr Manoj Gupta. Mr Dillon, who must be commended for his candid and helpful views, pointed out that the microstructure of the fragments of cylinder A that was seen in the reports of Det Norske Veritas and Dr Manoj Gupta could only have resulted from heating to a high temperature, quenching and tempering. All three processes occurred in that order in a factory and he thought that it was highly unlikely that all these could have occurred by chance during a fire in the bottle room.
 26.Dr Koshy could not explain why there were burn marks in the oxygen hose. In fact, after examining the hose in court, he refused to concede that some of the holes in the hose had burn marks even though it was fairly obvious that they did. He explained that heat from the heated cylinders passed into the pipes and softened the oxygen hose. He argued that the holes in the hose were the result of pressure waves travelling down the line, possibly from the exploding cylinders. This argument cannot be countenanced because the first large hole in the hose would have released the pressure and no other holes down the line, or at least not the number found on the hose, would have been created. Equally disturbing is the fact that he could not satisfactorily explain why paint remained on the inside and outside of the neck of the shattered cylinder and why the rubber therein had not melted. If the shattered cylinder had been subjected to heating at 840[deg ]C, as alleged by Dr Koshy, there would have been enough heat at the neck of the cylinder to melt the paint and to char the rubber. Furthermore, the wooden platform, on which the cylinder stood, was quite intact although it was slightly burnt. All these show that there could not have been a fire, and certainly not one of the intensity suggested by Dr Koshy, in the bottle room before the explosion.
 27.As for the argument put forward by the plaintiffs` expert witness, Mr David Robbins, that cylinder A did not explode as a result of heating from a pre-existing fire in the bottle room because it was broken into a large number of small pieces after it exploded, Dr Koshy suggested that the fragments of the exploded cylinder A were propelled at very high velocity against the bulkhead of the gas storage room, including the steel door. In his view, the impact from this collision caused a further shattering of the fragments of cylinder A into smaller pieces. That this was the case is most unlikely for as Dr Parry aptly pointed out, Dr Koshy overlooked the most obvious effect of heating a pressurised cylinder to a temperature in excess of 840[deg ]C. At such a temperature, the steel would be significantly softened and extremely ductile and one would, therefore, not expect a cylinder in such a condition to fracture into multiple fragments. In short, the underlying strength of Mr Robbin`s point, namely, that the physical evidence cannot be satisfactorily explained on the basis that there was a deflagration explosion occurring as a result of the accumulation of a flammable gas and air mixture within the bottle store, was in no way diminished by Dr Koshy`s arguments.
 28.Reference must now be made to the written report and affidavit of the defendants` other expert witness, Mr Barry Dillon. Although Mr Dillon did not agree with Dr Koshy`s views on the significance of the results of the metallurgical tests on the damaged gas cylinders when he was cross-examined, he did say in his report that there was strong evidence that the explosion in the bottle room was that of an oxygen cylinder that had been heated by a pre-existing fire in that room. To be fair to Mr Dillon, his report must be viewed in its proper context because it had been written without the knowledge that the oxygen hose had burn holes. When the report was written, the hose and the cutting torch were still in the possession of the Ministry of Labour investigators. He accepted, when cross-examined, that had the information regarding the holes in the hose been before him, his conclusion that a fire started first in the bottle room might have been different. He also conceded that having seen the hose and having heard the two conflicting versions as to how the fire started, he thought that the plaintiffs` version, namely, that the fire started as a result of a flashback from the cutting torch was `possible` if all four mechanisms devised to prevent this from happening, namely, the temperature sensitive valve, the pressure sensitive valve, the sintered metal and the return valve failed.
 29.After reading the reports of the respective experts and taking into account their oral evidence as well as the Ministry of Labour Investigation Report on the fire and explosion at the shipyard, I have no doubt that the plaintiffs` explanation as to how the fire on The Wilson Ruby started is to be preferred. It must follow that someone tried to light the cutting torch just before the fire, which broke out at around 4.15pm. No one has admitted that he used the cutting torch at the relevant time and the defendants claimed that the cutting torch could not have been lit because their men completed the repair work which required the use of the cutting torch by 2.30pm. All the same, an inference may be drawn from the available evidence that the hot work undertaken by the defendants had not been completed by 2.30pm. If the hot work had been completed, the relevant gas valves should have been shut. This was not the case. More significant is the fact that after the fire, the oxy-acetylene gas cutting torch, a spark lighter and a metal plate were found on the floor of the engine room. The cutting torch and spark lighter should have been stored properly if the cutting work had indeed been completed. Under cross-examination, Mr M Sivasamy, the chief engineer explained: 
Q: Where do you store the ignitor? 
A: Put in drawer of the work bench. 
Q: Cutting torch? 
A: Kept on shelf. 
Q: This system was understood by the crew? 
A: A technical person like Shetty, the fitter, knows the procedure. 
Q: Is it your evidence that Shetty does cutting work and knows the procedure? 
A: Yes.
 30.Another witness, Mr Jude Illango, the third engineer of The Wilson Ruby, under whose supervision the fitter, Shetty, carried out the work involving the use of the oxy-acetylene torch on the day of the fire, also claimed in his affidavit that the cutting work had been completed by 2.30pm but his evidence left much to be desired. When cross-examined, his answers were as follows: 
Q: On that day, did Shetty tell you he has finished cutting? 
A: No. 
Q: Why did you say that the cutting work was completed? 
A: He did not tell me but I told him he can finish. 
Q: Why did he not put the torch back, intermittent valves were open, ignitor there, gas bottle valves were open? 
A: I don`t know.
 It is thus reasonable to suppose that the hot work undertaken on the day of the fire had not been completed by 2.30pm and that someone lit the oxy-acetylene torch just before the fire occurred.
 31.
 Whether the plaintiffs` fire-fighting system was adequate
A question arises as to whether the plaintiffs were responsible in any way for the spread of the fire as the defendants complained at length about the fire-fighting arrangements with respect to their vessel. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs` fire-fighting arrangements failed to meet contractual requirements because para 2.1.7 of the `conditions of tender`, which were handed over to them by the plaintiffs, required the plaintiffs to provide a shore connection to the ship`s fire main. That this was not done is not in doubt. The plaintiffs had a system of fire-fighting which is, in their view, superior to a system which is dependent on the flow of water from the shore fire main into a vessel`s own fire main. They ran a hose from the shore fire line and left it pressurised all the time on mid-ship. This hose had a Y-breeching, which enabled other hoses to be connected in the event of a fire. Besides this hose, there was another hose which was lapped up at the ship`s side near the gangway.
 32.The so-called `conditions of tender` referred to by the defendants must be viewed in their proper context. It was prepared by Star Gas Italy on behalf of the former owners of The Wilson Ruby, who were then interested in having the vessel repaired. After the defendants purchased the vessel, they asked the plaintiffs to hand them a copy of the document, presumably to see the extent of repairs contemplated by the vessel`s former owners. This is the main role of this document. It follows that this document cannot have the effect of requiring the plaintiffs to put into place a system of fire-fighting which was not adopted by them. In any case, if the defendants believed that they had a contractual right to the benefit of another fire-fighting system, it is strange that they did not insist on their rights at an earlier date. They cannot say that they did not know that the shipyard`s own fire-fighting system was in place. When the vessel first arrived at the shipyard, the plaintiffs` personnel conducted a thorough safety briefing session with respect to the safety procedures in the yard and its fire-fighting system. The defendants` chief engineer, Mr M Sivasamy, admitted that he was aware of the shipyard`s fire-fighting system and that he knew that it did not involve connecting water from the shore`s main to the ship`s fire line. The defendants` superintendent, Mr Deepak Pandit, also testified that he knew from the time he first boarded the vessel in the shipyard that the ship`s fire main was not charged by the shipyard`s fire line.
 33.The defendants also complained that their men tried to connect their hoses to the ship`s own fire main and found that it did not work. Why they did this and why they failed to use the shipyard`s fire-fighting equipment in the proper manner cannot be understood. Mr M Sivasamy, the chief engineer of The Wilson Ruby, admitted that he had no fire plan and that he did not have any fire drills. Evidently, he had failed to communicate to his own crew the proper procedures to fight a fire and the plaintiffs cannot be held responsible for the crew`s confusion about the fire-fighting system in the shipyard.
 34.
 Conclusions
I now return to the question of bailment, which was referred to earlier on. In view of my findings, I do not have to consider the question of bailment at length. The plaintiffs are right in asserting that for the purpose of considering their duties with regard to the safety of the vessel, account must be taken of the fact that while the vessel was in the shipyard, a large number of her crew were on board for maintenance and repair work and that other contractors had been engaged by the defendants to do repair work. However, even if the defendants are right in asserting that this fact is irrelevant, the plaintiffs have satisfied me that the defendants` loss which resulted from the fire on The Wilson Ruby was not occasioned by the absence of reasonable care and skill on their part. A bailee is not an insurer for as Holt CJ explained in 
Coggs v Bernard
 
[1703] 2 Ld Raym 909
, p 918: 
He is only to do the best he can. And if he is robbed it is a good account. If he receives money and keeps it locked up with reasonable care he shall not be answerable for it though it be stolen.
 In this case, the plaintiffs took reasonable precautions and had proper safety procedures in place. Their fire-fighting equipment was in good order. There can be no doubt that the plaintiffs had done the best they could with respect to the safety of vessel while she was in their shipyard. It was the defendants` own personnel who undertook hot work without a permit or proper tools or any regard for safety rules. To allow the defendants to succeed in claiming damages from the plaintiffs would be clearly unjust.
 35.It follows that the defendants` claim for damages against the plaintiffs fails and they are not entitled to the declarations sought. As for the plaintiffs, they are entitled to judgment for the sum of $786,620.28 claimed with respect to repairs and for the sum of $350,050 claimed with respect to services rendered after the fire.
 36.As far as the claim for $350,050 is concerned, the plaintiffs are entitled to interest at the rate of 6% from the date of the writ. As for the sum of $786,620.28 claimed with respect to the repairs at the shipyard, the plaintiffs submitted that their standard conditions of contract applied and that they were entitled to interest at the rate of 1.5% per month, or 18% per annum, by virtue of cl 6 of the said standard conditions, which provided as follows: 
Unless alternative credit arrangements have been agreed, full payment for work done shall become due on completion of work. Interest at 11/2% per month will be charged on accounts overdue for payment.
 The defendants did not successfully challenge the plaintiffs` assertion that the said standard conditions of contract were handed over to them and that these conditions were terms of the contract. Admittedly, the plaintiffs were subsequently prepared to negotiate the terms of payment and to give the defendants credit for 60 days but they insisted that these negotiations, which did not result in any agreement between the parties on credit arrangements, did not affect their right to the contractual rate of interest for any delayed payment. The plaintiffs rightly pointed out that cl 6 of their standard conditions of contract made it clear that unless alternative credit arrangements had been agreed upon, interest was to be paid at the rate of 1.5% per month. The defendants contended that the offer of delayed payment terms by the plaintiffs could be construed as a waiver by the plaintiffs of their right to the contractual rate of interest. However, the question of waiver was not pleaded. Taking all circumstances into account, the plaintiffs are entitled to the contractual rate of interest of 1.5% per month in the case of their claim for $786,620.28.
 37.As for costs, the plaintiffs are entitled to taxed costs.",1998-03-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Background
This was a motion arising out of my decision in MA 198/97 dismissing the appellant`s appeal against sentence and conviction. The detailed facts are set out in my grounds of decision dated 18 May 1998. Briefly, the appellant was charged with permitting his employee to use a Class 4 motor vehicle without a valid driving licence and while there was no insurance coverage against third party risks in force, offences under s 35(1) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (the RTA) and s 3(1) Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (the MVA) respectively.
 2.In the court below, the appellant`s defence was that he had relied on the seller`s representations that the motor vehicle was a Class 3 vehicle and therefore permitted his employee, a Class 3 driver, to use the motor vehicle. The district judge found the seller`s evidence unreliable and held that the appellant had been wilfully blind to the class of the motor vehicle. The appellant was convicted and fined $1,000 for the RTA offence and $800 for the MVA offence, and disqualified from holding all classes of licence for 12 months. On appeal, I found the appellant strictly liable for the offences charged and upheld the fines. I also found no special reasons within the meaning of s 3(2) MVA to excuse the appellant from the statutory disqualification. It was the construction of the phrase `special reasons` that formed the subject matter of this motion.
 3.Pursuant to s 60 Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (the SCJA) the appellant`s previous counsel sought to refer two questions to the Court of Appeal; the first concerned the district judge`s finding of `wilful blindness` while the second question turned on the construction of `special reasons` for the purposes of the MVA. By a letter dated 4 June 1998 this court was informed by the appellant`s newly instructed counsel of his intention to withdraw the first question and re-phrase the second question. In the hearing before me on 8 June 1998, the application proceeded with the second question re-phrased in the terms set out below: (a). whether the Singapore courts other than the Court of Appeal are, in construing the words `special reasons` in s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks Compensation) Act, bound by the majority decision of the Singapore High Court of three judges in 
R v Lim Kian Soo
 
[1950] MLJ 181
 construing the words `special reasons` in the context of the predecessor section of s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks Compensation) Act; and,
 (b). whether, if the Singapore courts other than the Court of Appeal are not bound by the majority decision of the Singapore High Court of three judges in 
R v Lim Kian Soo
 
[1950] MLJ 181
 in the manner stated above, the Singapore courts should follow the decision of the majority in 
R v Lim Kian Soo
 
[1950] MLJ 181
 .
 4.The Public Prosecutor objected to this motion. Having heard the submissions tendered by both counsel, I was satisfied that this matter should proceed no further and accordingly dismissed the application. The appellant`s argument has time and again been canvassed before this court without success. In this regard, the reasons which I now set out for my decision will prevent future waste of the court`s time.
 5.
 The motion
The question which counsel for the appellant sought to refer to the Court of Criminal Appeal asked whether circumstances particular to the offender could constitute `special reasons` within the meaning of s 3(2) MVA to dispense with the mandatory disqualification stipulated by statute. The key to the question, as submitted by counsel for the appellant, was whether recent decisions such as 
PP v Balasubramaniam
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 822
  and 
 Joseph Roland v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 179
, upholding the 1947 ruling of Lord Goddard CJ in 
Whittall v Kirby
 
[1947] KB 194
, were made in ignorance of the Singapore High Court decision in 
 R v Lim Kian Soo 
; and whether this created a conflict of authority requiring reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Counsel for the appellant relied on the obiter dictum of Judicial Commissioner Kan Ting Chiu (as he then was) in 
PP v Akhtar Hussain Mann
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 266
  to argue that this question had not been unequivocally resolved. Having considered the ruling in 
 R v Lim Kian Soo 
, Kan Ting Chiu JC observed, at p 268G, that there appeared some uncertainty in Singapore whether `special reasons` extended to circumstances peculiar to an offender, adding that no such uncertainty existed in Malaya following the decision in 
PP v Teo Kok Keng
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 198
 . He then went on to comment that if put to choose between the construction in 
 Whittall 
 and that in 
 Lim Kian Soo 
, he would accept the former although on the facts before him he was not restricted to making such a choice.
 6.The construction in 
 Whittall 
 was an adoption of Lord Goddard CJ`s speech to magistrates and which was expressly considered in 
R v Crossan
 
[1939] NI 106
. The following extract from 
 Whittall 
 is widely quoted and reads: 
A special reason within the exception is one which is special to the facts of the particular case, that is, special to the facts which constitute the offence. It is, in other words, a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence, and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment. A circumstance peculiar to the offender as distinguished from the offence is not a `special reason` within the exception.
 
While it is impossible to enumerate or define everything that can amount to a special reason, one may give as an illustration a driver exceeding the speed limit because he has suddenly been called to attend a dying relative or a doctor going to an urgent call. So too it is certainly difficult to visualize what could amount to a special reason in the case of driving under the influence of drink or drugs, though perhaps one might be found if the court was satisfied that a drug had been administered to a driver without his knowledge, as for instance where a driver had taken a dose of medicine which he believed to be an ordinary tonic but which in fact contained a powerful drug. For myself, I would say that I strongly incline to the opinion that a person who drives or causes or permits a vehicle to be driven when there is no policy in force must be disqualified unless the court can find in relation to the particular offence some mitigating circumstance, and that mere forgetfulness or carelessness in not taking out a policy could not amount to a special reason.
 7.Goddard CJ`s construction of the phrase `special reasons` in 
 Whittall v Kirby 
 was followed not only in 
 Joseph Roland 
 and 
 Balasubramaniam 
 but also in numerous authorities for guidance on the construction of the phrase `special reasons`. The construction does not rob the court of discretion. It merely provides clear guidance as to the circumstances in which an offender is entitled, by law, for the mandatory disqualification to be dispensed with having regard to the facts of the offence. For example, the same English court some years later chose not to interfere with the magistrate`s decision to dispense with disqualification in 
Chapman v O`Hagan
 
[1949] 2 KB 690
 where the driver had taken drugs for a leg injury without knowing that it would make him more susceptible to the effect of alcohol. Closer to home, cases such as 
PP v M Karthiah
 
[1953] MLJ 52
 and 
Re Kanapathipillai
 
[1960] MLJ 243
 have followed 
 Whittall 
. The court in 
 M Karthiah 
 overturned the magistrate`s decision not to disqualify the appellant on the basis, stated at p 53 of the report, that `the appellant did not know of any other way of earning his livelihood other than driving a motor car`. Wilkinson J`s excerpt of Goddard CJ`s grounds at p 200 of the 
 Whittall 
 report is a fine example of the sound reasoning on which the judgment was founded. It read: 
It is to be observed that the sections are mandatory and that Parliament has provided that a period of disqualification shall be imposed but they have given a discretion to be exercised only for special reasons. The limited discretion must be exercised judicially. The reasons inducing the court to exercise it must be special, and special is the antithesis of general. The fact that a man is a first offender or that he has committed no motoring offence for many years are reasons of the most general character that can well be imagined. That a man is a professional driver cannot, as it seems to me, by any possibility be called a special reason. The fact that drivers are professional drivers would of itself indicate that they are more likely to be habitually on the roads than people who drive themselves, so there is all the more reason for protecting the public against them. By exercising discretion in favour of an offender because he is a professional driver it is obvious that the court is taking into account the fact that in such cases disqualification is likely to work greater financial hardship than in the case of a person who uses his car for social or casual purposes. There is no indication in the Act that Parliament meant to draw any distinction between drivers who earn their living by driving and any other users of motor cars Had Parliament intended that special consideration was to be shown to professional drivers or first offenders it would have so provided.
 8.The decision in 
 Karthiah 
 was followed in 
 Re Kanapathipillai 
, a case submitted by appellant`s previous counsel. Curiously enough 
 Re Kanapathipillai 
 was one of ten summons cases brought by the Deputy Public Prosecutor by way of criminal revision and for which Adams J took the opportunity to set out guidance for magistrates in the following terms (at p 243 H): 
Magistrates must appreciate that where there is a duty to disqualify a convicted person from holding a licence to drive a motor vehicle such duty falls not within the discretion of the convicting court but is imposed by the act of the legislature. This duty is not identified with the maximum punishment to be mitigated according to established principles. 
 The duty is mandatory but the act of the legislature has given a limited discretion to a convicting court, to be exercised judicially, to refrain from implementing the law`s clearly expressed requirement for a reason which is special to the offence but not for a reason special to the offender.
 [Emphasis is mine.]
 This passage noticeably resembled Goddard CJ`s statements in 
 Whittall v Kirby 
. Adams J then proceeded to discuss the reliance on 
 Whittall 
 in a number of local and English cases. Interestingly enough, he included the case of 
 Lim Kean Soo 
 in this list of cases. Although spelt differently, the case citation is the same as that of 
 Lim Kian Soo 
 submitted by counsel in this motion. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it would not be impossible to infer that Adams J had considered 
 Lim Kean Soo 
 and concluded that the court there followed 
 Whittall 
. In any case, Adams J`s analysis was considered extensively and approved in the grounds of decision of the magistrate`s appeal from which this application arose. It was my view that over the years, the judgments made pointed to a consistent construction of `special reasons` on the basis of Goddard CJ`s ruling in 
 Whittall 
. This decision has clearly withstood the test of time and for good reason. It is clear from case history that consideration of the 
 Whittall 
 judgment inevitably led to the decision being upheld and contributed to a healthy examination of the reasons to support such a construction.
 9.In this regard, I refer to the decision of Thomson CJ in ordering mandatory disqualification in 
PP v Mohd Isa
 
[1963] MLJ 135
 where he made several useful observations. The appellant had pleaded guilty to a charge of permitting an unlicensed person to drive his motor-cycle and of allowing his motor-cycle to be used while an insurance policy was not in force. The magistrate had refrained from making a disqualification order on the ground that the offender required the use of his motor-cycle to get to his place of work; that he had many dependants to support and that he was a sick man. Thomson CJ reminded magistrates that for `special reasons` to dispense with the mandatory disqualification order, they had to be connected with the commission of the offence. With circumspect grace, he noted that there may be a certain amount of misunderstanding because some statements of the law have been over academic and metaphysical. Yet the statutory intention in mandating disqualification remained intact given his experience that the most satisfactory penalty for most motoring offences was disqualification because a fine is paid once and then forgotten. In his view, a disqualification meant that for 365 days the accused person is reminded every morning of his offence and so where an order for disqualification is made, except in serious cases of being drunk in charge or dangerous driving, the quantum of the monetary penalty imposed was of relatively minor importance. 
 Whittall 
 was applied again in 
PP v Hiew Chin Fong
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 467
  and the construction appreciated for the reasons that the offence is not to be taken lightly. If an innocent road user is knocked down and injured or killed, he and/or his dependants may have no means of recovering from the uninsured driver any loss or damage he and/or they may have suffered or sustained. It is clear from these authorities that to construe special reasons as being those connected with the offence and not the offender would be the clearest means of giving effect to Parliament`s intention. Parliament could not have intended an offender to be excused from the mandatory punishment by virtue of circumstances unique to his situation but irrelevant to the commission of the offence. The mandatory punishment is designed to take away the right that was abused in committing the offence.
 10.Against the weight of authority upholding 
 Whittall 
, counsel for the appellant submitted 
 R v Lim Kian Soo 
 as a decision inclined to a contrary construction of `special reasons`, thereby arguably creating a conflict of authority that necessitated reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In
 Lim 
, Murray-Aynsley CJ considered 
 Whittall 
 to bear persuasive as opposed to binding authority on the court and was of the opinion that Goddard CJ`s guidance in 
 Whittall 
 were open to objection in that they cut down on the discretion given to the courts. He expressed concern that circumstances of a personal nature may sometimes be valid and held that the matter should be treated as a question of discretion. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the decision in 
 Lim 
 was of binding authority on the basis of the stare decisis doctrine discussed in 
Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd
 
[1944] 2 All ER 293
: that, subject to three exceptions, courts are bound to follow previous decisions of its own as well as those of courts of a co-ordinate jurisdiction. He argued that the judgment of the court in 
 Lim 
, being a High Court sitting with three judges on a special case, was binding on the High Court hearing the appellant`s appeal in MA 198/97.
 11.With respect, the Singapore court`s position on this doctrine is well founded in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Mah Kah Yew v PP
 [1971] MLJ 1 [1969-1971] SLR 441 , and upheld in 
Wong Hong Toy v PP
 [1994] 3 SLR 396 . In 
Wong Hong Toy v PP
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 336
  
[1986] SLR 86
 , this jurisdiction`s well-known doctrine of precedents was confirmed in that the High Court is not bound by a previous decision of a High Court judge. Counsel contended that in the interests of promoting certainty, courts sitting in their appellate capacity should be bound by their own decisions. While in agreement with this principle, I had regard to the advice of the court in 
Chan Hiang Leng Colin v PP
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 687
  that in the interest of maintaining finality in proceedings, it was better to exercise a discretion to refer sparingly so that the references are not used as an indirect way of appealing against matters that under the law have been finally determined by the High Court. I found this application to be one such veiled appeal. The court is not faced with so many vastly differing views as to suggest there is a rift in the authorities. I did not find the question so exceptional as to require reference; in fact, a glance at the many authorities upholding 
 Whittall 
 demonstrates that this was a common question before the High Court hearing appeals from the magistrate`s courts. It has clearly been authoritatively laid down and consistently applied by the courts here and, in the circumstances, there is no conflict of authority: 
PP v Bridges Christopher
 
 
[1997] 2 SLR 217
 .
 12.Finally, counsel submitted that the question sought to be referred was of public interest because its definition bore far-reaching implications in view of the use of the phrase in other statutory provisions. I could not agree. If one examined the other contexts in which the phrase `special reasons` was employed, for example, in s 21A(1) of the Environmental Public Health Act, it became clear that the 
 Whittall 
 construction did not necessarily apply to all occasions for which Parliament had chosen to legislate for special circumstances. This is clear from the decision of the court in 
PP v Lim Niah Liang
 
 [1997] 1 SLR 535 
 which held that `special reasons` permitted the court to exercise some discretion in deciding whether or not to sentence a physically disabled offender to carry out a corrective work order. The use of the phrase there relates to the viability and effectiveness of meting out such specific sentences as provided by the EPHA. That application can safely be distinguished from the question raised in this motion.
 13.
 Conclusion
I found it timely, almost half a century after Murray-Aynsley CJ`s remarks in 
 Lim Kian Soo 
, to confirm the construction laid out in 
 Whittall 
 and thereafter followed in numerous authorities. Accordingly, there was no conflict of authority on any question to be worthy of referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.",1998-07-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 The appellant was charged with driving motor car SBP 9320 J while there was not in force a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risk, an offence under s 3(1) Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (MVA). He was convicted and fined $600 and sentenced to one year disqualification for all classes. The appellant paid the fines but appealed against the disqualification order. I dismissed his appeal and now give my reasons.
 2.
 Background
On 5 March 1998 the appellant`s car was involved in an accident along with two other vehicles at the Whampoa East junction of Serangoon Road. Investigations revealed that the appellant drove his vehicle without valid insurance coverage. The insurance policy for the car had expired approximately 3 months and 21 days before the date of the accident. The appellant pleaded guilty to the offence charged but contended that there were special reasons on the facts of his offence that justified dispensing with the mandatory disqualification order prescribed by s 3(2) of the MVA. The district judge found it incredulous that the appellant had continued driving his car without bothering to verify his cheque or that he was properly insured. He held that the appellant`s omission to do so could not be a special reason not to be disqualified.
 3.
 The appeal
Before me, counsel for the appellant submitted that the circumstances leading to the offence, if exceptional, could amount to special reasons. The defence was that at the material time, the appellant held a belief that the car was validly insured against third party risks. It is clear, following 
Knowler v Rennison
 
[1947] KB 488
, that the facts must show not only that the belief was innocent but that it was based on reasonable grounds. I could find no reasonable ground for such a belief on the facts before me. In fact, given that the appellant`s first cheque had been dishonoured, and hence no valid insurance coverage applied to his car, it would have been reasonable to expect the appellant to ensure his second cheque was properly processed if indeed he genuinely sought to be covered by insurance. He made no effort to do so.
 4.The policy behind the 12 months mandatory disqualification of s 3(2) MVA was considered in 
Stewart Ashley James v PP
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 426
  which found it to be the deterrence of vehicles being used in circumstances endangering the user and other persons on the road, leaving such persons without compensation should the user not be able to satisfy the judgment. More recently, I examined the authorities which dealt with the present offence in 
MV Balakrishnan v PP
 (Unreported) and discussed what amounted to `special reasons` within the meaning of s 3(2). The law is clear that the reason must be special to the offence, not the offender: 
Re Kanapathipillai
 
[1960] MLJ 243
 . On the facts before me, I found no reason special to the offence to dispense with mandatory disqualification. It would appear that had the accident not occurred, the appellant would have continued driving around Singapore with the excuse that he had not received any notice that his insurance had lapsed. To permit road users to escape with such irresponsible conduct would go against the policy behind the enactment and would be an abuse of the legislature`s leniency accorded to cases where genuine special reasons exist.
 5.On the appellant`s own facts, it did not go unnoticed that his counsel`s submission of his being `not without means` was supported by an Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore statement of account accompanied by a demand note dated 21 March 1998 informing the appellant that a 5% penalty had been imposed on his overdue income tax. It was clear to me that this appellant could not be of sufficient means to be a road user should he continue to fail meeting payments. In all the circumstances of his case, I found no merit to his appeal. It was dismissed and the disqualification order upheld.",1998-07-22 00:00:00,SG High Court

YONG PUNG HOW CJ
 
 Introduction
This was an appeal against the decision of the district judge in the subordinate court. He found the appellant together with four others guilty of rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). All the accused were sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on the rioting charge. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence on the rioting charge.
 2.
 The charge
The appellant was charged that he (and four others) on 23 March 1997, at or about 2.40am, in front of the Specialist Shopping Centre (SSC), Somerset Road, Singapore, together with two other unknown male persons, were members of an unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to cause hurt to one Ong Kay Wei, male 18 years old and, in the prosecution of such common object, violence was used and he had thereby committed an offence of rioting punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code.
 3.
 The facts
The facts of the case were largely not in dispute. The incident occurred at the SSC on the left side of Somerset Road facing the direction of Takashimaya Shopping Centre, just opposite Club 97. A group of four young motorcyclists, three with pillions, were riding along Somerset Road, at about 2.30am on 22 March 1997. PW1, Ong Kay Koon, rode one of the motorcycles with his friend PW2 riding pillion. The victim, PW1`s brother, Ong Kay Wei (PW3) was riding alone.
 4.When they were riding along Somerset Road, PW1 received a page from his house and he signalled his friends to stop opposite Club 97, SSC on the left side of the road. They all stopped their motorcycles while PW1 made a call on his handphone.
 5.Two men dashed across the road in front of Club 97, shouting vulgar words. One of the men flicked a cigarette butt at the motorcyclists. Three motorcyclists, including PW1, rode off. PW3 could not start his motorcycle and was set upon by the two men who had crossed the road, followed by four or five other men.
 6.PW3 was assaulted by the group and suffered multiple abrasions and a laceration. The other three motorcyclists managed to ride away but PW1 later returned to the scene. A group of four policemen who were on patrol in the SSC vicinity saw the assault and chased the assailants. They were assisted by another group of five policemen in a patrol car in front of the SSC. The five accused, including the appellant, were arrested.
 7.Two identification parades were held at the police station subsequently. PW1, PW2 and PW3 were able to identify the appellant at the identification parade.
 8.
 The prosecution`s case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was mainly as follows. PW1 and PW2 were eyewitnesses to the assault of PW3. PW1 had identified the appellant as the man who had thrown the cigarette butt at the motorcyclists. He also pointed out the appellant as one of the first two men who had shouted vulgarities at the motorcyclists and was one of the first who had crossed the road to where PW3 was, to assault him. PW1 also picked out the appellant at an identification parade conducted at Tanglin Police Station.
 9.PW2 was slower on the scene than PW1. He also postively identified the appellant as the man who had thrown the cigarette butt. This corroborated PW1`s evidence that the appellant was one of the first two persons who were on the corridor and the road. He also picked out the appellant at the identification parade.
 10.The victim, PW3, also identified the appellant as the man who threw the cigarette butt. He testified that he saw the group of about six men move towards him and, as he was so nervous staring at them, he was unable to start his motorcycle. He saw the first two men clearly and identified one of them as the appellant. He further related how the appellant had grabbed hold of his neck from the back and kicked his motorcycle. His motorcycle fell and leaned on PW3 and also the appellant`s leg causing it to be trapped. Only when someone shouted `police` did the group stop attacking him and start to run. PW3 had identified the appellant at the scene. He also identified the appellant at the police parade.
 11.
 The defence case
The defence was that the appellant had been mistakenly identified as being one of the attackers. The appellant claimed that he had been to Club 97 with another accused B1 and had left when the club closed. He was merely standing outside waiting for a taxi. He also claimed that he was so drunk that he was not aware of what was going on around him. The defence claimed that this was a case of mistaken identity as the appellant did not know the other three accused who were also involved in the fracas.
 12.The prosecution applied to impeach the appellant`s credit by using the statement he gave to PW10 under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The district judge found a material discrepancy between the statement he gave and his testimony at the stand and allowed the DPP to impeach his credit.
 13.The statement taken by PW10 contradicted his statement in court. In the statement, the appellant stated that he had been joined at the club by some friends and, when the club closed, had walked out with Ah Chai (B1) and a few friends. He later claimed that he never said that and that he had walked out only with B1.
 14.The appellant claimed that he was neither the one who flicked the cigarette butt at the motorcyclists nor the one who was involved in the fracas. In support of his case that it was one of mistaken identity, he relied on the fact that it was late at night and the prosecution witnesses were some distance away. As such, he claimed that they were unable to see the assailants clearly.
 15.The defence pointed out inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses such as the fact that they were unable to point out the exact number of attackers. He also pointed out that there were discrepancies between the defence`s version of how the appellant had been arrested and the prosecution`s version.
 16.The defence also relied on the medical reports. They claimed that the fact that the appellant had not suffered any injury was inconsistent with PW3`s claim that the appellant had been the one who had assaulted him and the motorcycle had fallen down on him as well as the appellant. Further, PW3`s medical report showed no injury to his neck and this contradicted his claim that the appellant had grabbed him by the neck.
 17.
 The decision of the trial judge
The trial judge found the appellant guilty and convicted him on the rioting charge. He based his conviction on the identification evidence of the prosecution witnesses (PW1, PW2 and PW3) at the scene, and on the identification parades as well as in court. In convicting the appellant, he disbelieved the appellant`s defence of mistaken identity. He found that the appellant`s credibility had been impeached. As such, the appellant was to be disbelieved that he had left the club only with B1. Instead, he accepted the appellant`s earlier statement as evidence to the effect that four or five of his friends had joined him at the table in the Club that he had left the Club with B1 and a few other friends that day.
 18.He found that the group including the appellant had the common object to cause hurt to the victim. This common object was formed on the spot when they rushed as a group across the road to attack him. Although the appellant and another member of the group had reached the victim first, whereas the others were one or two metres behind, it could not be said that they did not form a group when they had dashed across and assaulted PW3. Whether or not the group members had a common intention to hurt PW3 was irrelevant ( 
Lim Thian Hor v PP
 
 
[1996] 2 SLR 258
 ). The trial judge also found that, in order to hold so, there need not necessarily be proof that all the members of the unlawful assembly must know each other.
 19.After considering all the evidence against the appellant, the version given by the appellant and the submissions of defence counsel, the trial judge was satisfied that the defence had not managed to rebut the prosecution`s case that the appellant was a member of the unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to cause hurt to PW3 and that, in the prosecution of their common object, PW3 was assaulted and hurt by them. As such, he decided that the appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him on the rioting charge.
 20.
 Issues arising in the appeal
The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. At the outset, it should be noted that the grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant were primarily factual.
 21.In my opinion, the trial judge, as the trier of fact, had the benefit of observing the demeanour of both the prosecution and defence witnesses. He was entitled to prefer the evidence of the prosecution witnesses over that of the defence. The Court of Appeal in 
Ng Soo Hin v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 105
  had held that an appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge`s findings and his reasons therefor. This was also reaffirmed in the case of 
Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP
 
 
[1997] 3 SLR 464
 .
 22.Here, the trial judge considered the evidence of both the prosecution witnesses and the appellant at length. He was satisfied that the appellant had not managed to rebut the prosecution`s case that the appellant was a member of the unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to cause hurt to PW3 and that in the prosecution of the common object, PW3 was assaulted and hurt by them.
 23.In my opinion, the findings of fact by the trial judge were not so unreasonable as to warrant an overruling by an appellate court.
 
 Appeal against conviction
A Contradictory evidence of prosecution witnesses on number of attackers
 24.One of the grounds of appeal was that the trial judge erred in not properly considering and weighing the contradictory evidence of the prosecution witnesses on the number of attackers. In my opinion, this was not a valid ground of appeal. There was no material discrepancy in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses with regard to the number of attackers. The general consensus was that there were more than six persons assaulting PW3. PW1 and PW2 saw six to seven attackers, PW3 testified that about five to six persons assaulted him. The police witnesses gave essentially the same evidence.
 25.It is true that the prosecution witnesses were unable to give the exact number of persons who attacked PW3 at the material time. This was hardly surprising seeing that they had observed the event from different places and at different times. PW1 was riding his motorcycle away from the scene and had turned his head away to look at his brother, PW3. PW2 was riding pillion on PW1`s motorcycle and had turned around as well to look at the scene. As for the police witnesses, they were some distance away from the scene and had only started running towards the scene when they were alerted to the fracas.
 26.Under such circumstances, it was hardly surprising that there was a discrepancy in the evidence of the prosecution as to the number of attackers. In 
Chean Siong Guan v PP
 [1969] MLJ 63 , Abdul Hamid J stated that: 
 Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies
 This view was endorsed by the learned Chief Justice in the case of 
PP v Kalpanath Singh
 
 
[1995] 3 SLR 564
 .
 27.The trial judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that this was a minor discrepancy and I was of the same opinion. The crux of the matter was that the totality of evidence showed that the five persons who were arrested on that day were members of the group who had attacked PW3. As such, it should not matter that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses as to the number of attackers.
 B Quality of the identification evidence
 28.Another ground of appeal by the appellant was that the appellant had been wrongly identified. This was in fact the gist of the appeal. In support of this ground, counsel for the appellant raised several points.
 (i) Inadequate lighting
 29.He pointed out that the incident happened at about 2.40am in the night, and hence the prosecution witnesses would not have been able to identify the attackers as the place would be dark at that time. At the trial, evidence by way of some 20 photographs taken by DW6 (the defence counsel`s secretary) was adduced. These photographs showed that the vicinity of the place where the incident took place was dark at night.
 30.However, the trial judge had considered DW6`s evidence carefully and concluded that the photographs taken by DW6 were unreliable. In coming to this conclusion, the trial judge took into consideration the fact that DW6 had not taken any courses on photography and that the photos taken may not have been an adequate reflection of the actual conditions at the scene. In particular, DW6 had conceded that the area was not as dark as it had appeared in the photographs. DW6 had also testified that there were street lamps in the vicinity. Further, there could well be other factors contributing to the darkness of the photographs.
 31.I note that the evidence of PW1 and PW6 that the place was well-lighted was not challenged at all at the trial. As such, the trial judge was justified in accepting PW1 and PW6`s evidence that the area was well-lighted and, as such, they and the other prosecution witnesses could see what they had testified to in court.
 (ii) Contradictory evidence on the existence of steps
 32.The evidence of the prosecution witnesses was that there were steps leading from the corridor to the pavement. In reality, there were no steps. As such, counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence on the identification of the appellant on how he had climbed down the steps and moved to the pavement to attack PW3 became suspect. Therefore the trial judge erred in not properly considering and weighing this in convicting the appellant based on the identification evidence of the prosecution witnesses.
 33.There is no indication that the trial judge did not properly consider this discrepancy. He realised that PW1, PW2 and PW3 had testified that the attackers had used the steps to move from the corridor to the pavement. However, he concluded that these witnesses must have been mistaken about the steps as no photographs were shown to them.
 34.Further, as the trial judge rightfully pointed out, the error in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the existence of the steps or staircase was not a material one. What was material was that the `movement of the group from the corridor down to the kerb, down to the road is something seen by these six prosecution witnesses`. As such, this minor discrepancy would not affect the credibility of PW1, PW2 and PW3.
 (iii) Contradictory evidence of prosecution witnesses in identifying the attackers
 35.The trial judge, in my opinion, had carefully considered the relevant evidence. In relation to PW1, he was cross-examined extensively by the appellant`s counsel but PW1 maintained that, when he first heard the shouting, he had already seen the faces of the men standing outside Club 97. He observed them for a period of one to three minutes. He saw one of them smoking and throwing a cigarette butt at the motorcyclists. He could identify that one of the two men who had dashed out first was the appellant. When he rode off on his motorcycle, he passed by the group and again had the opportunity to look at them. He then looked behind him and saw a group of about six or seven persons assaulting PW3. PW1 could identify the five accused as part of the group of persons who had assaulted PW3. At the scene and at the identification parades, he could also identify the appellant as one of the persons who had assaulted the appellant. The trial judge considered that it was clear that PW1 had relied on a sequence spanning more than one to three minutes to base his identification of the five accused.
 36.As for PW2, he stated that he had a good look at the faces of the attackers when they were at the corridor, at the steps and on the road. He had turned back as PW1 rode off on his motorcycle. Although PW2 could not recognise all the attackers, he was sure that the appellant was involved in the attack as it was the appellant who had thrown a cigarette butt at him and his friends. PW2 managed to identify the appellant at the scene as well as at the identification parades.
 37.PW3 gave evidence that the appellant was one of the attackers. He went into considerable detail as to the manner in which the appellant had assaulted him. He also identified the appellant at the scene and at the identification parades.
 38.As such, all the three prosecution witnesses were able to identify the appellant as being the person who had first dashed across the road and attacked PW3. PW2 and PW3 could also identify the appellant as the person who had thrown a cigarette butt in their direction. Therefore, as far as the identification of the appellant by the prosecution witnesses was concerned, I was of the view that there were no discrepancies in their evidence.
 C Medical reports
 39.A further ground of appeal was that the medical evidence was inconsistent with the prosecution witnesses` evidence. PW3 testified that the appellant had grabbed him by the neck from behind. However, the medical examination report showed no sign of injury on his neck. Further, the doctor (PW4) testified that, during the examination, PW3 had not complained about his neck. In my opinion, the district judge was correct to hold that this was not fatal to PW3`s evidence that he was grabbed by the appellant by the neck. Whether he would suffer from any physical injury would depend on the manner and the amount of force used by the appellant when he grabbed PW3`s neck. Further, the fact that PW3 had not complained to PW4 about his neck was not surprising when the other injuries he was suffering from were considered multiple abrasions over the right shoulder, upper chest and elbow. Since he was not injured around the neck, it made perfect sense that he did not complain about his neck.
 40.The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in not considering and weighing that no injuries were detected on the appellant at all. I did not see how the trial judge erred in this. The appellant had attacked the victim with four other persons. With five persons hitting PW3, he could hardly retaliate. Thus, it was hardly surprising that the appellant managed to walk off without a single scratch on him. Further, the appellant argued that, since PW3 had alleged that the motorcycle had fallen down and pinned the appellant`s leg, there should be evidence of injury. The trial judge had considered this and noted that PW3 had also stated that the motorcycle had fallen on him as well as the appellant. It may be that the motorcycle had fallen down harder on PW3 and he thus bore the brunt of the fall. Also, whether the appellant would suffer from any injury would depend on the force and manner the appellant`s leg was pinned under the motorcycle.
 D Evidence of the witnesses at the identification parades
 41.Counsel for the appellant submitted that the evidence on the identification parades was unreliable as the accused were wearing their own pants and shoes while the other people in the parades were dressed in police pants and shoes. He submitted that the `consequences in law are very serious if one were to accept the accuracy of such identification parades`. In my opinion, the trial judge had considered carefully the evidence and was entitled to draw the conclusion that he drew, based on the evidence adduced before him. He had noted that PW1, PW2 and PW3 had testified that they had picked out the respective accused persons according to their faces and not their jeans. He noted that, had they been influenced by or relied on the jeans or pants worn by the accused instead of their faces to pick out each of them, they could have identified all the five accused at the two parades. Instead, PW1 had identified only four accused, B2 to B5. PW2 identified three accused, B1, B2 and B4. PW3 also identified B2 to B5. The trial judge stated: 
Although it was proper for all the paraders to be similarly attired, the identification of the five accused were not based on their different attire. I was convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that all five accused were members of the group which assaulted PW3. My finding was not solely based on the identifications made at the parades. However, the identifications at the parades, at the scene and in court formed part of the evidence I had relied on.
 E Impeachment of appellant`s credit
 42.The appellant confirmed that he had given the statement P24 freely without any threat against him. He could not give any reason why PW10 would substitute a different version from what he had stated. When the appellant was confronted with the discrepancy between the highlighted portion of P24, namely, `
 We were joined by another four to five friends at our table I walked out with Ah Chai and a few friends 
`, and his evidence in court, namely, that he was not joined by anyone at Club 97 and that he had left Club 97 with only B1, he stated that he did not know how to explain the contradiction.
 43.In these circumstances, the trial judge was correct in holding that the appellant`s credit had been impeached. He found that, as the statement had been taken only two days after the incident which occurred on 22 March 1996, the incident should still be fresh in the appellant`s mind. Thus, his recollection should be better on 25 March 1996 than on 28 August 1997, when he gave evidence. He could also find no conceivable reason why PW10 would, at the risk of losing his job, substitute his own version for what the accused had told him.
 44.
 Conclusion
The trial judge had clearly identified all the issues which the defence raised during this appeal, considered them, and still found that the prosecution had proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. In my opinion, the trial judge was right in holding so. There may be a few inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses but they were minor discrepancies. Accordingly I was of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.
 45.
 Sentence
In reviewing the sentence, I was drawn to conclude that the sentence of 18 months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane was manifestly inadequate. Not only were there no mitigating factors in favour of reducing the sentence, there were serious aggravating factors in the appellant`s conduct.
 46.PW3 was only 18 years old whereas the appellant was 32 years old at that time. Furthermore, PW3 had done nothing to provoke the appellant and the appellant had just set upon PW3 together with another four or five other people. They had rained continuous blows and kicks upon him. The appellant also had previous convictions (one for gaming in public and another for consumption of drugs). The medical report was that PW3 had suffered `multiple abrasions over the right shoulder, upper chest, mild abrasion over the right elbow that was bleeding from the subdermal vessels with surrounding mild elbow swelling and tenderness on movement`.
 47.Accordingly I enhanced the appellant`s sentence to 24 months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.",1998-08-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant, Rav Ie @ Raghavan Iyengar, appeals against the sentence of three months` imprisonment and three years` disqualification from holding all classes of driving licence, imposed by the district court when he was convicted on a charge of causing the death of a passenger in his car by driving the motor car in a manner which was dangerous to the public, an offence under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 92). The appellant had pleaded guilty to the charge.
On 20 July 1985, the appellant drove along Tanglin Road at a fast speed and encroached on the wrong side of the road when negotiating a bend, and collided with an on-coming taxi. As a result of the collision the rear passenger in his car was killed on the spot. The certified cause of death was: asphyxia due to aspiration of food.
The trial judge was of the view that s 67(1) prescribed a mandatory sentence of up to five years` imprisonment and that it did not provide for a fine as punishment.
The main point raised in the appeal is whether imprisonment is mandatory under s 67(1). The provision is that a person guilty of an offence under s 67(1) `shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years`.
Counsel for the appellant relied on the Malaysian case of 
 PP v Man b Ismail 
 
 
 
[1939] MLJ 207
  where the words `shall be liable` were construed by Aitken J. and where he held that `shall be liable to imprisonment` in s 3(a) of the Vagrants and Decrepit Persons Enactment (FMS Cap 191) did not render a sentence of imprisonment mandatory. He said (p 208): 
 
It would also seem that the learned magistrate, who tried this particular case, was under the impression that because the section provides that every person found guilty of an offence against it `shall be liable to imprisonment for six months`, therefore he was compelled to pass some sentence of imprisonment on such a person however many mitigating circumstances might be present. If that was his impression, then in my opinion he was under an entirely wrong impression as to the meaning of the words `shall be liable to`. To my mind they give the court an absolute discretion as to whether it shall award a sentence of imprisonment or deal with the accused under and in accordance with the probationary provisions of s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code. If the legislature had intended that all persons convicted of an offence against this s 3(a) of the Vagrants and Decrepit Persons Enactment should be sent to prison, whatever the circumstances may be, it would have used the expression `shall be punished with imprisonment`, which is to be found so frequently in our Penal Code.
 
 
 
It is to be observed that Aitken J was there dealing with the question whether the court could deal with a person, who had been convicted of any offence punishable with imprisonment, under and in accordance with the probationary provisions of s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6). He was not dealing with the question of whether the court had a discretion to impose a fine in lieu of imprisonment.
In 
 PP v Hew Yew 
 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 164
 , Raja Azlan Shah J also construed the words `shall be liable` in s 15(4) of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance 1959 of Malaysia, which reads: 
 
A registered person who contravenes or fails to comply with any order or restriction imposed on him under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and not less than two years.
 
 
 
The learned judge reviewed certain authorities on the words `shall be liable` therein. They show that where provisions of law provide for a term of imprisonment or an amount by way of fine, the courts have a discretion to impose a term of imprisonment or fine not exceeding the maximum prescribed. In the context of s 15(4) of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance, from the words `shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and not less than two years`, the learned Judge expressed this view (p 164): `From that it seems to me that the court has an absolute discretion to impose the maximum sentence of five years or any lesser sentence the minimum of which must not be less than two years.`
In the result, he set aside the sentence of a fine imposed by the lower court and substituted a sentence of two years` imprisonment.
In 
 Jayanathan v PP 
 
 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 68
  the following question of law was referred to the Federal Court of Malaysia: 
 
Whether the provision of s 15(4) of Prevention of Crime Ordinance 1959 overrules the provision of s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code in so far as an offence against s 15 of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance is committed.
 
 
 
In that case, the applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of contravening a restriction order imposed on him under s 15 of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance 1959. The learned President bound him over in the sum of $1,000 in one surety under s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The time for appeal having lapsed, the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor applied for revision of this order to the High Court on the ground that `the learned President erred in law in imposing a sentence of binding over when s 15(4) of the Ordinance clearly states `shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and not less than two years`.`
The Federal Court considered the cases of 
 PP v Hew Yew 
 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 164
  and 
 PP v Man B Ismail 
 
 
 
[1939] MLJ 207
  and considered the provisions of s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code (FMS Cap 6). Ong Hock Sim FJ delivering the judgment of the court said (p 69): 
 
This section (s 294) vests the court before which a person is convicted with power to suspend sentence for such period as the court may direct, and, if the offender behaves himself during such period, he would escape punishment for his offence. If he fails to observe the conditions of his bond, he would be liable to be apprehended and dealt with for his original offence. As Thomson J (as he then was) said in 
 PP v ldris
: `Section 294 which only applies in the case of adult offenders can only be made use of where a person has been convicted and where his conviction is for an offence punishable with imprisonment without the option of a fine.
 
 
 
I do not wish to lay down any hard and fast rule, which in any event would be difficult to prove, but magistrates would be well-advised only to make use of s 294 where an offence which is generally of a serious nature and which is punishable with imprisonment has been committed by an adult offender and where it is considered desirable to place him on probation.`
The learned judge concluded: 
 
In our view, if the legislature intended that s 294 is to cease to have application in respect of an offence under s 15 of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance, it should be so expressed in the clearest possible language. We can find no such provision.
 
 
 
Our answer to the question, we repeat, is in the negative.
Here again, the Federal Court was dealing not with the question whether the court had the discretion under s 15(4) of the Prevention of Crime Ordinance to impose a fine in lieu of imprisonment; it decided that the accused could be bound over under s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It seems to me that, in the present case, the trial judge`s view that s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act prescribed a mandatory sentence of up to five years` imprisonment and that the section did not provide for a fine as punishment is correct.
In the circumstances of this case, the sentence imposed by the trial judge is not manifestly excessive.

 Appeal against sentence 
 
 Appeal against conviction
By a motion dated 18 February 1992 the applicant applied to the High Court to appeal against conviction as well, and sought leave to file a fresh petition within 14 days from the date of the order to be made on the motion or from the date of the receipt of the grounds of decision.
Section 250 of the CPC provides as follows: 
The High Court may, on the application of any person desirous of appealing who is debarred from so doing upon the ground of his not having observed some formality or some requirement of this Code, permit an appeal upon such terms and with such directions to the District Judge or to the Magistrate and to the parties as the Court considers desirable in order that substantial justice may be done in the matter.
 No right of appeal to Court of Criminal Appeal
The form of the application seeking to file a fresh petition is not strictly within the letter of s 250. Nonetheless, I heard the application and disallowed it. The appellant has filed a notice of appeal against my decision to the Court of Criminal Appeal. In my view, the notice of appeal is misconceived. Appeals are statutory creations. There is, however, no provision for an appeal from the High Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a decision refusing leave to present an appeal out of time. Section 44 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`the SCJA`) gives the right of appeal from a High Court judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal against a decision by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction. The decision of the High Court in question was not in respect of its original criminal jurisdiction as the original jurisdiction was exercised by the magistrate. In form and substance, it was an application under s 250 of the CPC asking the High Court judge to exercise its appellate jurisdiction.
Section 29 of the SCJA gives the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear appeals against decisions of the High Court in civil matters, whether made in the exercise of its 
 original 
 or of its 
 appellate 
 jurisdiction. Section 44 of the SCJA is different. It does not provide for an appeal against a decision of the High Court in the exercise of its 
 appellate 
 jurisdiction in criminal matters.
 Merits of the application
Notwithstanding the foregoing, I shall explain my decision for dismissing the application.
In 
Zulkifli bin Puasa & Ors v PP,
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 461
  Sir Alan Huggins JA, speaking for the Brunei Court of Appeal, said [at p 462]: 
There are two factors to be considered upon an application for an extension of time, (1) the length of the delay and whether it can be satisfactorily explained, and (2) whether the out of time application is likely to succeed.
Where, as here, the delay is of short duration the court may, if it thinks fit, disregard the delay, even in the absence of satisfactory reasons, but, where a substantial interval of time (a month or more) has elapsed, an extension of time will not be granted, as a matter of course, without a satisfactory explanation: see 
 Rhodes 
 [(1910) 5 Cr App R 35]. Where the delay is minimal the court will still not grant an extension of time if the application for which the extension is sought is bound to fail: there must be an arguable case. Moreover, even though the subsequent application may be likely to succeed - as where a fellow prisoner`s conviction has been quashed - the court will not grant an extension of time as a matter of course: see 
 Rigby 
 [(1923) 17 Cr App R 111]. The entire circumstances will be considered.
In 
Ratnam v Cumarasamy,
 
[1965] 1 WLR 8
[1964] 3 All ER 933
 Lord Guest, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in an appeal from Malaya, stated at p 12: 
The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of the rules, which is to provide a timetable for the conduct of litigation.
On behalf of the applicant his counsel made an affidavit in which he deposed, inter alia, as follows: 
Due to an oversight and typographical error the applicant`s appeal against the conviction was not included in the aforesaid notice of appeal.
I would say that from instruction[s] given to me I am of the view that the applicant is not guilty of an offence under s 27B of the Road Traffic Rules 1981.
I would say that the applicant has a good chance of succeeding in his appeal against conviction.
I would further say that there is [sic] good merits in the applicant`s notice of appeal filed herein.
Apart from those sentences made in a somewhat casual fashion, there was nothing of substance to explain and substantiate the assertions made by counsel. In particular, there was no statement or submission on the point that was to be raised in the proposed appeal against conviction. No material was placed for the court to consider in order to make its own conclusions on the merits of the proposed appeal on conviction. To use a time-honoured phrase, there was no affidavit on merits.
Additionally, it took more than five months to discover the `typographical error` (from 3 September 1991 to 18 February 1992). The delay of more than five months was inordinate and no satisfactory explanation was given in the affidavit. There was also no explanation how the alleged oversight occurred and why it was not discovered earlier.
Further, whenever such an application is allowed, the judge in the lower court would be directed to state his grounds of decision on conviction. An appeal against conviction involves different considerations from an appeal against sentence. In an appeal only against sentence, the lower court need not go into the evidence and merits of the case, but need only consider matters such as the seriousness of the crime, the mitigating factors, the background of the accused and antecedents of the accused, if any. The judge would be disadvantaged in writing his reasons for the conviction if he has already given his grounds on sentence only. The delay would have induced the judge to put the case off his mind especially when there has been a long delay in notifying him that he must give the grounds on conviction as well.
If applications are allowed on the basis of assertions made in this case, the court`s role will be reduced to rubber-stamping such applications.
The matter was a relatively minor traffic offence carrying a small fine. The magistrate had given his grounds on sentence after almost six months after conviction. The applicant, in all circumstances, failed to make out a case that he might be denied substantial justice.

The applicants` appeals against conviction and sentence of death for murder were heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 13 April 1989, one week before the Judicial Committee (Amendment) Act (Act 21/89) came into operation on 21 April 1989, abolishing all appeals to the Privy Council in criminal cases except in any case where the offence is punishable with death or imprisonment for life, and where the decision of the appellate court is not unanimous. The appeals were, to all intents and purposes, dismissed some 21 months later in a reserved judgment dated 10 January 1991. One of the three appellate judges who heard the appeal and signed the judgment was AP Rajah J; however, he retired from the Bench on 30 September 1989, during the interval between the hearing of the appeal and the signing and delivery of judgment. On the day that judgment was delivered, he was therefore no longer a judge of the Supreme Court.
In moving these criminal motions before us, the applicants asked for leave to appeal to the Privy Council or for an order that the judgment dated 10 January 1991 be declared invalid and the conviction set aside. We ordered that their appeals be reheard before a new Court of Criminal Appeal here and now give our reasons for so doing.
In Pt V of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`the Act`), s 43 provides that for the purpose of `hearing and determining` appeals under that part, the Court of Criminal Appeal `shall be duly constituted if it consists of not less than 3 Judges or any greater uneven number of Judges`. Any other tribunal will not be a duly constituted Court of Criminal Appeal and so cannot have the powers and duties described in Pt V. The duty of such a duly constituted Court of Criminal Appeal is, inter alia, to hear and determine appeals in the manner prescribed in ss 54 and 55, and then to `deliver judgment in open court` (s 56(1)). Such judgment, then, may not be delivered by any other tribunal.
We are of the view that though the Court of Criminal Appeal was duly constituted for the hearing of the appeal, the appellate tribunal which delivered judgment upon the applicants on 10 January 1991 was not a duly constituted Court of Criminal Appeal and was not competent to deliver that judgment pursuant to s 56(1) of the Act.
Furthermore, it was not competent to determine the appeals, for that determination only occurred on the date of delivery of judgment. In 
 Surendra Singh & Ors v State of Uttar Pradesh 
 ,1 Bose J said that a judgment of the court was the expression of the court`s opinion at the time of delivery. Until the time of delivery, a judge is entitled to change his mind as to what is to be delivered. Therefore, any judge who delivers a judgment or causes it to be delivered by a brother judge must be in existence as a proper member of the court at the moment of delivery. Subject to s 33 of the Act, we would agree with this analysis in relation to the Singapore High Court. Certainly, we think it right in relation to criminal cases. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, then, the purported determination of the appeal in the present case also occurred on 10 January 1991 and was also effected by a tribunal incompetent to do so.
The Judicial Committee Act (Cap 148) as it stood before 21 April 1989 would have permitted persons in the applicants` positions to apply to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal to it. The transitional provisions at the commencement of the amendment Act prescribe that: 
 
This Act shall not apply to any appeal, application for leave or application for special leave to appeal made under the principal Act against 
 any decision of the appellate court given before the commencement of this Act
 .... (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The express wording of the transitional provisions does not allow of the conclusion that the previous statute should operate in this case. A `decision of the appellate court` is not the same thing as being heard by the appellate court. As has already been explained above, the judgment and not merely written reasons was held back after the hearing, so the `decision` was not given on 13 April 1989. Therefore, the amended provisions apply and the applicants could only appeal to the Privy Council if the decision of the appellate court was not unanimous. In this case, all who signed the judgment dated 10 January 1991 concurred in the decision that was handed down. Therefore, the unanimity of that Bench was not in doubt. In other words, there is no room for a submission to the effect that the appellate decision was both valid and yet not unanimous. It was in fact a unandecision of a tribunal that no longer had jurisdiction to make such decision. As such, there is no question of an appeal to the Privy Council under the amended provisions of the Judicial Committee Act.

Whether sentence of one day's imprisonment and $4,000 fine manifestly inadequate
  – 
ss 323, 325 & 506 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The respondent, Lee Seck Hing, was charged with voluntarily causing hurt by fracturing the victim`s right arm, an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). He was also charged with committing criminal intimidation of the victim by threatening him with injury, telling him that he would get people to `look him up` and thereby causing the victim alarm, an offence punishable under s 506 of the Code. He claimed trial, but after the victim`s evidence had been taken, he changed this to a plea of guilty. On the first charge under s 325, he was sentenced to one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $4,000, in default, four months` imprisonment. The second charge of criminal intimidation was taken into consideration. He has served the one-day imprisonment and paid the fine of $4,000. The public prosecutor now appeals against the sentence.
The facts of the case are as follows. On 26 November 1990 at about 10.30am, the victim, Thng Yong Heng (whom I shall refer to as `Thng`) was driving his car along the East Coast Parkway. While trying to overtake a slow-moving vehicle in his lane, he switched onto the outer-most lane and, in the process, cut into the path of the respondent who sounded his horn. According to Thng, he raised his arm in apology and cut back into his original lane to allow the respondent to pass. Instead of doing so, however, the respondent proceeded to follow Thng closely, simultansounding his horn and flashing his headlights at Thng. Thng left the expressway at the Benjamin Sheares flyover and drove in the direction of Beach Road. At the junction of Rochor Road and Beach Road he stopped at a red light. It was then that he saw the respondent stopping behind him and emerging from his car. Thinking that he would apologize to the respondent, Thng, too, alighted from his car. He never got to utter his intended apology, for the respondent began to hit him even before he could speak. In defence, Thng attempted to push and kick the respondent away but to little avail as he was of smaller build. The respondent was eventually restrained by passers-by, by which time he had succeeded in breaking Thng`s right arm.
A passer-by then drove Thng to the Singapore General Hospital. Unhappily for Thng, the sorry incident was far from over, for the respondent now tailed his car all the way to the hospital, stopping alongside Thng`s car at a traffic light to threaten further reprisals. Such was the terror Thng suffered that upon reaching the admission entrance of the hospital, he went on his knees in apology to his aggressor. The respondent replied with further threats of injury, telling Thng that he would get people to `look (Thng) up`. It is this threat which formed the subject of the charge of criminal intimidation.
Thng was treated at the hospital where it was confirmed that he had suffered a `closed comminuted fracture of the right humerus`. He was hospitalized for eight days.
As the respondent pleaded guilty to the first charge, he would normally have no right of appeal against the conviction by virtue of s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`), which provides: `When an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a district court or magistrate`s court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.`
Notwithstanding his guilty plea, however, the respondent has taken the rather unusual course at this appeal of first challenging the conviction itself on the ground that there was a miscarriage of justice at the trial in the lower court. The arguments offered by his counsel were that he was convicted of an offence which was not supported by the evidence adduced at the trial, also that the lower court in either convicting or sentencing him was not entitled to rely upon statements of facts which were challenged by him, and in respect of which the lower court failed to evaluate the extent to which the evidence of the victim was accepted or not accepted. Accordingly, the respondent through his counsel, argued today that this court should exercise the powers of revision given to it by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) and, in fact, quash the conviction of the lower court.
As to the first of the arguments which have been raised, I need only say that in my judgment the conviction was more than supported by the evidence which was adduced at the trial before the lower court.
As to the other argument that the lower court is not entitled to rely upon the statements of facts, the record shows that after the respondent informed the court that he wished to plead guilty to the first charge, the charge was read and explained to him and he confirmed that he understood the charge and the nature and consequences of his plea, before he in fact pleaded guilty. The charge was a comparatively simple one, and I have no doubt that he knew and understood what he was pleading guilty to. After he had pleaded guilty to the first charge, the prosecution informed the court that the facts were those which had been adduced by Thng, the victim, in his evidence to the court, and the record shows that the respondent, in fact, confirmed that he admitted these facts. In my judgment, there can be no doubt that, having been in court throughout the proceedings, and having listened to Thng give his evidence and being cross-examined at length by the respondent`s counsel, the respondent admitted the validity of the facts of Thng`s evidence for the purpose of the court determining the sentence to be imposed.
That leaves me only to deal with the question of the sentence. Having reviewed the above circumstances, I am of the view that the sentence of one day`s imprisonment and $4,000 fine (in default, four months` imprisonment) was manifestly inadequate to reflect the gravity of the offence. The respondent was convicted of having voluntarily caused grievous hurt pursuant to s 325 of the Code. The offence is one which carries a maximum custodial sentence of seven years. Section 325 further prescribes caning as an alternative to a fine, to be imposed together with the custodial sentence. Clearly, therefore, the law takes a stern view of such offences. There may well be cases where a custodial sentence of no more than the statutory minimum of one day`s imprisonment, which the district judge imposed, is justifiable. I do not think that can be said of the present case. The respondent was the one who set upon Thng and beat him up badly enough to fracture an arm, all because of the trivial incident of Thng`s car cutting into his path.
Furthermore, as the prosecution has pointed out, there existed in the present case various aggravating factors, in particular, the shocking behaviour of the respondent in then tailing his injured victim to the hospital and in persisting in vengeful threats even as his victim knelt to apologize. I find myself in agreement with the prosecution that these factors are not trifling and yet, with the greatest respect to the learned district judge, whose grounds of decision I have perused with care, they do not appear to have been given sufficient weight in the court below. I would also add, again with respect to the district judge, that it seems to me irrelevant in the context of the present case that the respondent only inflicted a single injury on Thng or that he used no weapons. The only reason why Thng was fortunate enough to suffer no more than a broken arm was because passers-by intervened to prevent the respondent from continuing with the assault. As for the absence of weapons, that simply means that this was not an offence punishable under s 326 of the Code, but that has no relevance when the appellant was charged and convicted under s 325.
Violent crimes are one of the curses of our society against which it is the primary duty of the courts to protect the public. This is especially so on a small island like Singapore, where citizens live in close proximity to each other: our daily lives are unavoidably intertwined to some extent, making the preservation of order and harmony all the more important.
It is true that in this case the respondent is a relatively young man and that this was his first offence. At the same time, this court cannot ignore the fact that his conduct evinced a vindictive and overbearing nature which led him to act in disregard of the law. The court must also be mindful of the need to deter anyone else who would resort with impunity to violence on the roads, especially in view of the deplorable increase in such incidents. Our roads are progressively becoming more crowded each month, as more and more cars add to the traffic, and motorists must simply learn to live with one another. There can be no place on our roads for road bullies. Such persons must be made aware of the severe detestation the law expresses in regard to such crimes. They must not be allowed to go away thinking that they can beat up somebody else on the slightest provocation for the price of a few thousand dollars. If this sort of incidents occur, when they get out of their vehicles and assault others who may have aggravated them by their driving or for any other reason, prison sentences must now follow where the offence is `voluntarily causing hurt` under s 323 of the Code, and where the offence is the more serious one of `voluntarily causing grievous hurt` under s 325 of the Code, caning should be imposed.
The respondent does not appear to have shown any real remorse, and even in this court today, his counsel has, presumably on his instructions, even claimed that the sentence imposed by the district court of one day`s imprisonment and $4,000 fine was a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I allow the public prosecutor`s appeal. Instead of the manifestly inadequate sentence of one day`s imprisonment and fine of $4,000 (which should be refunded to the respondent) there will be substituted a sentence of 12 months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
I also make an order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC for the payment by the respondent to the victim of the sum of $5,000 by way of compensation in respect of the injury.

In May 1984 the appellant, who was a police sergeant attached to the Tanglin Police Station, was charged in a district court under s 201 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (the Code) for causing evidence of the commission of an offence by one Razali to disappear by deliberately not submitting with the investigation papers a statement by one Razali which he had recorded, with the intention of screening Razali from legal punishment.
What happened was that in the course of investigating a criminal case against Razali, the appellant took two statements from Razali. In his first statement (P3), Razali said that one stick of cannabis found in a cupboard in his house belonged to him; in his second statement (P4), which was made only ten minutes later, he said that the cannabis did not belong to him, and he explained that his earlier statement (P3) and an earlier admission to CNB officers that the cannabis did belong to him were made because of his fear that the CNB officers might assault him. The appellant, believing the second statement, P4, to be correct, submitted it to his superior with the investigation papers but retained the first statement, P3. The appellant kept P3 at all times in his desk drawer and produced it to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) as soon as he was asked about it. At the conclusion of the trial in the district court, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to four months` imprisonment.
The appellant appealed to the High Court against his conviction and sentence. [See 
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 136
 .] After the notice of appeal was filed, the grounds of decision of the district judge together with his notes of evidence were made available in the usual way to the appellant. It was found from p 51 of the typewritten copy of the notes of evidence that the district judge had recorded this note after the close of the prosecution`s case:
 
 
DPP: Applies under s 163 CPC to amend charge under s 204 Penal Code. 
 
Court: Defence called on 
 amended 
 charge (emphasis added). 
 
Two courses explained to accused in ordinary language. 
 
Elects to give evidence from the witness box.
  
 
 
The grounds of decision included the following passage by the district judge, in explaining what he did after receiving the evidence and the submissions of counsel and the deputy public prosecutor: 
 
In the circumstances I called on him to make his defence on an 
 amended
 charge (emphasis added) under s 204 of the Penal Code. He elected to give evidence from the witness box.
 
 
 
After considering the evidence of the appellant, the district judge found as follows: 
 
The court considered his evidence carefully and was satisfied that he had not raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case. He had given a host of reasons which I rejected. In the circumstances I found him guilty of the 
 amended
 charge (emphasis added) and convicted him accordingly.
 
 
 
There had in fact been no application for any amendment by anyone. In his petition of appeal, the appellant complained that the amendment was false and consequently there had been prejudice and grave miscarriage of justice occasioned to him. The appellant`s other principal complaint was that the district judge made a grave error in coming to a positive conclusion as to the appellant`s guilt at the end of the prosecution`s case.
While the appeal was in train before the High Court, extraneous correspondence ensued between the deputy public prosecutor, the officers of the subordinate courts and the district judge, who had by then become the Registrar of Trade Marks. In his first letter, as he was not then in a position to contradict the typewritten notes of evidence, the district judge was unfortunately led to explain that, at the conclusion of the prosecution`s case, he had in mind to amend the charge from one under s 201 to one under s 204 of the Code but had inadvertently failed to amend the charge. At the hearing of the appeal in the High Court, the appellant`s counsel therefore contended that a compelling inference should be drawn from that letter that when the district judge was writing his grounds, he was in fact addressing the ingredients of the charge under s 204 and not under s 201 of the Code.
After arguments in the appeal were completed in the High Court and judgment was reserved, further correspondence took place between the officers of the subordinate courts and the district judge. It was then suggested that the district judge should reconsider his explanation since it was thought that his handwritten manuscript notes and the typewritten version of them which had been certified as his notes of evidence did not correspond in respect of the word `amended`. On checking his manuscript notes, the district judge then realized what had happened. In his second letter, he explained that there was a typographical error in the typewritten notes of evidence in that the word `original` in the manuscript notes had been misread by the typist as `amended`. He did not, however, offer any explanation as to the ghost entry `DPP: Applies under s 163 CPC to amend charge under s 204 Penal Code`. Chan Sek Keong J held that the handwriting in the manuscript notes was legible and the word was in fact `original` and not `amended`. He was satisfied therefore that the s 201 charge to which the appellant had claimed trial had never been amended, that the defence was called on that charge, and that after the appellant and his witness gave evidence in connection with that charge, he was convicted on that charge. He described the district judge`s failure to explain `the so-called application by the DPP` as an aberration. All the same, he concluded that such an aberration did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. He, therefore, dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence.
After the appeal was dismissed, the appellant took out a motion under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (the SCJA) for an order that eight questions of law of public interest, which had arisen in the course of the appeal, and the determination of which by the judge had affected the event of the appeal, be reserved for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Four of these questions, as amended by the learned judge, were stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal [see 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
 ] and were argued before us.
Before dealing with the four questions, it would not be inappropriate for us to review the application for the reference itself, in view of the manner in which the application was argued and decided in the court below. The relevant provisions of s 60 of the SCJA are as follows: 
 
(1) When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, the Judge may on the application of any party and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal.
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(5) For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions - 
 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; and 
 
(b) the reservation of a question of law for the consideration of the High Court under the provisions of any written law relating to criminal procedure or the exercise by the High Court of any power of revision under any such written law shall be deemed to be an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter.
  
 
 
It is clear from the terms of s 60 that the court has discretion whether or not to refer a question to the Court of Criminal Appeal when the application to the court is made by a party other than the public prosecutor, even if the question satisfies all the prescribed conditions. It is equally clear that the reference must be of a question of law of public interest, which has arisen in the course of the appeal, and the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal. The crucial condition in the present case was whether these were questions of law of public interest. There is a paucity of published authorities in Singapore on s 60, but in applying the section Singapore courts have always had regard to the authorities decided under the corresponding s 66 of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964. In delivering an oral judgment on a reference to the Federal Court in 
 Tan Yin Yen 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 143
 , Suffian ACJ said: 
 
It is to be observed that questions of law which may be referred to us under s 66 should not be questions that are of personal interest only to the accused or the public prosecutor, but should be questions that are of public interest, and it seems to us better if the High Court were to exercise their discretion under s 66 sparingly, so that the references are not used as an indirect way of appealing against matters that under the law have been finally determined by the High Court.
 
 
 
This statement was endorsed in two oral judgments in the High Court, by Hashim Yeop A Sani J in 
 Sivalingam v PP 
 
 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 27
  and by Abdoolcader J in 
 Ibrahim bin Haji Karim 
 v 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 280
 , in both of which applications for questions of law to be referred to the Federal Court for determination were dismissed. (See also 
 Cecil Rajah v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 147
 .)
Section 66 was considered at greater length in 
 Ragunathan v PR 
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 139
  in which Raja Azlan Shah ALP said on pp 141 and 142: 
 
But it is not sufficient that the question raised is a question of law. It must be a question of law of public interest. What is public interest must surely depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of law raised in the course of the appeal is of public interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this court or the Privy Council or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by the highest court or the general principles in determining the question are well settled and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
It was urged upon us that in at least two previous cases (see 
 PP v D`Fonseka 
 
 
 
[1958] MLJ 102
  and 
 Yap Ee Kong v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 144
 ) the applicants had successfully obtained a reference, and that we should follow those cases and determine the questions referred to us. It was further said that the questions are of general importance upon which further argument and a decision of this court would be to the public advantage (see 
 Buckle v Holmes 
 
[1926] 2 KB 125
). A short answer is that the two cases referred above involved misdirections in law and this court had no hesitation to intervene because they called for discussion of alternative views. There are no views about the present case.
...
But basically, we must consistently decline to receive and answer questions which, though they may be questions of law, are nevertheless not questions of law of public interest, in the sense as we understand it, that a necessity arises for the determination of the questions having regard to the uncertain or conflicting state of the law on the subject; see s 66(6)(a) Courts of Judicature Act 1964.
In 
 Nunis v PP 
 
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 114
 , the Federal Court refused an application and Raja Azlan Shah CJ in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 118: 
 
For leave to be granted, it is necessary that the question posed is a question of law raised in the course of the appeal to the High Court and is of public interest. I have in delivering the judgment of this court in 
 Ragunathan v PR
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 139
  dealt with the test for determining what amounts to a question meeting the requisite factors for the purposes of s 66 of the Courts of Judicature Act, and I made it clear that if it is a mere question of principles, which in the matter before us only involve the construction of certain words in a statutory provision in their application to the facts of the case, the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
In 
 PP v Choo Ching Hwa & Anor 
 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 229
 , the Malaysian Supreme Court dismissed an application by the public prosecutor to refer several questions of law to the Supreme Court. In delivering the judgment of the court, Hashim Yeop A Sani CJ (Malaya) said at p 231: 
 
It hardly needs to be emphasized that an application for leave under s 66 of the Act the court should adopt an attitude of reluctance and be slow in granting leave. This attitude was clearly indicated in 
 Tan Yin Yen v PP
 
 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 143
  and 
 Ragunathan v PR
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 139
 . The basis for this attitude is to ensure that an application for reference does not become an appeal in disguise which is not the intention of s 66(1) of the Act.
 
 
 
The local belief in the application of s 60 of the SCJA was unsettled when the Privy Council took the opportunity in 
 Jeyaretnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 425
  to give their views at p 432 on the meaning of the section: 
 
The conviction of the appellant on the accounts charge depends on a construction of s 199 of the Penal Code first propounded by the Chief Justice sitting as a single judge and later adopted by Judge Foenander and Lai Kew Chai J, which is attacked as bad in law. The convictions on the $2,000 and $200 cheque charges depend on findings of fact by the Chief Justice reversing the primary findings of the trial judge on grounds which are attacked as bad in law. The affirmation by the Chief Justice of the conviction by Judge Khoo of the $400 cheque charge is attacked as bad in law. The appellant has had no opportunity to test any of the questions of law which he claims are involved by appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore or, if necessary, by further appeal to the Board, because the Chief Justice and Lai Kew Chai J refused to reserve any questions of law pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and, in the absence of such reservation, neither the Court of Criminal Appeal nor the Board had any jurisdiction to entertain any appeal. If it can be shown that there were questions of law of public interest which should have been reserved for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal and that this would have led to the quashing of the convictions either by the Court of Criminal Appeal or on appeal by the Board, it must surely be appropriate, to quote Lord Simon`s words `that the conviction(s) should not be conclusive against the accused in the course of disciplinary proceedings, the object of which themselves is, after all, to promote justice`.
 
 
 
Their Lordships have from the outset entertained no doubt that these convictions do indeed raise serious questions of law and they find it difficult to understand how any serious question of law arising in a criminal case on which a person`s conviction of a grave offence may depend can be said not to be `of public interest` within the meaning of s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. In the end, therefore, the determination of the appeal turns on the question whether the convictions are vitiated by errors of law.
The Privy Council`s views were considered at considerable length by Chan Sek Keong J at the hearing of the motion in the court below. As the views expressed by him in his grounds of decision (see 
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 275
  at pp 279-280) accord with those of the Court of Criminal Appeal, they are set out in extenso below: 
 
It is to be noted that the views of the Federal Court of Malaysia on the corresponding section were not considered by the Privy Council, presumably because the relevant decisions were not cited. The test laid down by the Privy Council as to when a question of law is of public interest, ie `any serious question of law ... on which a person`s conviction of a grave offence may depend`, is not easy to apply, if only because of its uncertain ambit. What is a 
 grave
 offence as distinguished from any other offence? From the case itself, we can deduce that any offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment is a grave offence, as Jeyaratnam was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment on one of the charges. He was also fined on one charge in an amount which disqualified him from being a Member of Parliament. Does potential disqualification from holding a public office make an offence grave? Is the test of gravity related to the standards of morality or conduct of Singapore society or to the individual`s own standing in society or both? The gravity of an offence is not necessarily commensurate with the gravity of its consequences to the person who has been convicted of such offence.
 
 
 
What is a 
 serious 
 question of law as distinguished from any other question of law? The ambit of this requirement is also uncertain as the Privy Council has not given any guidelines, beyond stating that the convictions against Jeyaretnam raised serious questions of law. What were these questions of law?
On the accounts charge under s 199 of the Penal Code (ie making a false declaration in relation to the accounts), the question was whether the declaration signed by Jeyaretnam was a declaration within the terms of s 199 of the Penal Code. The Privy Council held that there was no ambiguity about that section, that `what is required is a declaration which is per se admissible `as evidence of any fact`, that the declaration made by Jeyaretnam, not being a statutory declaration, was not per se admissible of the facts stated therein, although it was receivable in evidence.
With respect to the charges on the $2,000 cheque and the $200 cheque, on both of which the Chief Justice reversed the trial judge`s decision, the Privy Council held that the trial judge`s decision was based on findings of fact and that the Chief Justice in setting out to controvert the findings of fact on the central issue as to the circumstances in which the donor had altered his cheque to make it payable to bearer, had exceeded his proper function as an appellate judge and had thereby committed a 
 serious error of law 
 which vitiated his decision.
With respect to the charge on the $400 on which Jeyaretnam was convicted by the trial judge, the question of law was whether the drawer was entitled to withdraw his cheque or change the donee whilst the cheque was still in the possession of Jeyaretnam. The Privy Council, after stating that `this was perhaps the simplest case of all and here it was the trial judge who fell into error probably because the right point was never clearly taken`, held that there was an imperfect gift of the cheque, and therefore the donor could withdraw it at any time, and was on the evidence withdrawn because he did not want the proceeds to go to the receiver for the creditors of the Workers` Party.
The question of law common to the three cheques was whether the property in them had passed to the Workers` Party at the time the cheques were altered by the donor or dealt with by Jeyaretnam with the consent of the donor. The Privy Council held that the property in the cheques had never vested in the Workers` Party as, until they were presented for payment or negotiated to a third party, each of them was nothing more than a revocable mandate to the drawer`s bank to pay the amount shown and a revocable promise to the donee that the amount would be paid. Accordingly, the drawer could change the mandate and the promise at any time before it was acted upon. The reason why the lower courts went wrong on this question of law was that, according to their Lordships, `It is fair to all concerned to point out that these important considerations do not appear to have been fully appreciated at any stage in the criminal proceedings or to have been adequately formulated in argument until the matter reached the Board.`
It can thus be seen that of the questions of law considered as serious by the Privy Council, two of them concerned substantive principles of law: (i) the gift cheque as a revocable mandate, which was the `simplest of all`, and (ii) the legal nature of a declaration under s 199 of the Penal Code, which turned on the fine distinction between a declaration that is admissible 
 as 
 evidence of the facts stated therein and one that is admissible 
 in 
 evidence but not of the facts stated therein. The other two questions of law concerned (iii) the proper role of an appellate court in regard to findings of fact by a trial judge.
The word `serious` used in relation to ideas and concepts connotes the quality of weightiness, complexity and importance and requiring or deserving careful and thoughtful consideration. Except for point (ii) which was conceptually a subtle and therefore difficult point, the other points were not serious in the above sense as point (i) was held to be simple, and point (iii) is settled law.
In regard to point (iii), it was, of course, open to argument that the Chief Justice`s approach was wrong, and, in the event, the Privy Council held that the Chief Justice committed a serious error of law. However, the word `serious` in this context means no more than that it made the difference between an acquittal and a conviction. But, it should be noted, that this kind of questions of law, by its nature, can only be raised in relation to a particular case. It is of no public interest. It was of personal interest to Jeyaretnam in each case.
In Singapore, the majority of criminal cases are tried in the subordinate courts. The normal recourse available to a convicted person who is dissatisfied with his conviction and/or the sentence is to appeal to the High Court. It is in the public interest that a person who has been wrongly convicted of any offence (and not only a grave offence), whether by the wrong application of the law or the application of the wrong law, should be able to have it corrected on appeal. Such a right is provided under existing law, but it does not go beyond the High Court. The public interest in giving a convicted person the right to have his conviction corrected on appeal has to be balanced against the public interest that there has to be finality in the proceedings, and Parliament has decided as a matter of policy that finality in criminal cases tried in the subordinate courts stops at the High Court. Parliament has set the balance by giving a limited right of appeal in such cases rather than to allow them to go all the way to the Privy Council. However, Parliament has also recognized that there are certain questions of law which should be settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal as it is in the public interest that they should be so settled. It is doubtful that s 60 was designed to refer for decision by the Court of Appeal questions which by their nature cannot affect the outcome of cases other than those from which they arose.
It is on these considerations that the courts in Malaysia and Singapore have recognized the limitations of s 60. It is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts. Hence, Suffian ACJ`s caution that the provision be used sparingly lest it be made use of as an appeal provision.
In the present case, on the application of the appellant, Chan Sek Keong J stated to the Court of Criminal Appeal four questions of law of public interest:
 
 
Question 1: whether in law the signed copy of the record of the trial transmitted to the appellant under s 249 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) may be corrected by reference to the manuscript notes of evidence of the trial judge; 
 
Question 2: whether the omission of the trial judge to explain his entry in relation to an event that never took place during the trial was sufficient by itself or in the context of the whole record to vitiate his verdict in this case; 
 
Question 3: whether the trial judge had made up his mind as to the guilt of the appellant before calling on his defence and whether the trial judge had misdirected himself in convicting the appellant on the basis that it was not for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt; and 
 
Question 4: whether, on the evidence, the appellant had caused P3 to disappear.
  
 
 
 
 
 Question 1 
 
 
 
On question 1, whether in law the signed copy of the record of the trial may be corrected by reference to the manuscript notes of evidence of the trial judge, Mr Rubin conceded at the hearing before us that the answer should be in the affirmative, but he submitted that any such correction should be subject to stringent qualifications. He drew our attention to s 249 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC), which requires the trial court to transmit to the High Court and to the public prosecutor a signed copy of the record of proceedings and of the grounds of decision, but makes no reference to the trial judge`s manuscript notes of evidence. We were also reminded of the principle that a trial court, having delivered the grounds of decision may not supplement them, or amplify them: 
 Loh Kwang Seang 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 [1960] MLJ 271 
; 
 Habee Bur Rahman 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1971] 2 MLJ 194
 .
In the form in which this question has been posed to us, we have no doubt that Mr Rubin was right in conceding that the answer to question 1 must be in the affirmative. In the present case, there was no question of the notes being supplemented, or amplified. Although the sequence of events may have been tortuous, what happened in this case was simply that the trial judge`s handwriting, which was somewhat the antithesis of copperplate, led to a mistake in transcription and the word `original` in the note of the court`s decision was misread by the trial court`s secretary as `amended`, a mistake contributed to undoubtedly by the sentence immediately preceding which referred to an application to amend the charge. It was clear to us on inspecting the manuscript notes in question, as it was clear to Chan Sek Keong J in the High Court, that the notes showed that the defence was called on the `original` charge under s 201 and not on an amended charge under s 204. It was in fact a simple clerical error. Provisions such as s 249 merely recognize the fact that handwritten manuscript notes, if they are not otherwise required to be preserved in handwritten form, are normally converted into typewritten copies for easier reading. There is no rule of law which requires a clerical mistake in typing a court record from a handwritten manuscript to be preserved or which protects it from being corrected. The fact that the copy of the trial record has been signed, because the mistake was not detected before signature, cannot prevent the mistake from being corrected once its existence comes to light. The signature on the signed copies which are transmitted to the High Court and to the public prosecutor is to show and authenticate their origin, and no more. This must be so, regardless of whether correction of the mistake would be to the advantage of one side or the other.
 Question 2 
In the present case, there were two obviously inconsistent explanations given by the district judge as to how the mysterious entry could have arisen. Mr Rubin submitted that the appellant`s complaint went to the root of the administration of justice, because an unsatisfactory explanation gave rise to a suspicion that justice had been rushed and had not been manifestly seen to be done. He referred the court to Lord Hewart`s often quoted statement in 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Sussex Justices 
 
[1924] 1 KB 256
 at p 259; to 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Thames Magistrates` Court, ex p Polemis 
 [1974] 2 All ER 1219; and 
 Manokaran & Anor 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 262
 . The deputy public prosecutor conceded that it was clear that the district judge made an error, but he referred the court to s 396 of the CPC and to the recent cases of 
 Seah Kok Huah 
 
 v 
 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 466
  and 
 Chow Dih 
 v 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 197
 . Section 396 provides as follows: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by the court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code; 
 
(b) the want of any sanction required by section 129; or 
 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence, unless 
 the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice 
. (Emphasis added.)
  
 
 
In our opinion, the real question is whether, in considering the charge against the accused, the district judge`s mind had actually been directed towards a consideration of s 204 instead of s 201, and whether consequently this had `occasioned a failure of justice`. From an examination of the notes of evidence, we note that apart from its appearance on p 51 of the appeal record, to which we have referred, the erroneous reference to s 204 appeared in only one other place, on p 82. On the other hand, correct references to the charge under s 201 appeared in all other parts of the appeal record. The appellant`s counsel at the close of the prosecution`s case submitted that no case had been made out under s 201 and in his closing submission dealt only with the charge under s 201. The district judge began his grounds of decision by reciting the whole charge under s 201, immediately following which he recorded: 
 
He claimed trial to the charge, at the end of the trial he was found guilty and was accordingly convicted. He was sentenced to four months` imprisonment. He now appeals against the conviction and sentence.
 
 
 
It is clear from the district judge`s review of the appel`s counsel`s submission and his explanation of his own reasons for calling on the appellant to make his defence that he was considering a charge under s 201. Of particular significance was his reference, on pp 81 and 82, to the question of the exh P3 being caused to `disappear`, and his reference, on p 87, to the appellant`s counsel`s closing submission that there had been no criminal intention to cause exh P3 to `disappear` to `screen` Razali. The terms `disappear` and `screen` are of course essential ingredients under s 201, but have no part in s 204. In our opinion, a close examination of the appeal record shows, in spite of the two inexplicable references to s 204, that the whole proceedings were clearly in relation to a charge under s 201, and that the district judge and both the appellant`s counsel and the deputy public prosecutor were dealing with a charge under s 201, and accordingly that there was no failure of justice.
 Question 3 
This question is in two parts. As to the first part, Mr Rubin submitted that, by observing that the appellant had shielded Razali by keeping out P3, the district judge made up his mind as to the guilt of the appellant before calling on his defence, and that this ran counter to the principles laid down by the Privy Council in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 v 
 PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  which enjoins the judge as decider of fact to keep an open mind. In our opinion, this was a clear misapplication of the principles in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
`s case to what happened in the present case. This authority was in fact cited to the district judge by the appellant`s counsel in his submission of `no case` at the close of the prosecution`s case, when he made a detailed submission that the ingredients of the offence under s 201 had not been proved. This led the deputy public prosecutor in reply, as he was bound to do, to submit that all the ingredients had been proved, and in the process also to cite 
 Haw Tua Tau 
`s case. The district judge, having considered the submissions, recorded: 
 
I was satisfied that a case had been made out against the accused, which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction.
 
 
 
As to the second part of question 3, Mr Rubin referred to Chan Sek Keong J`s observation (appeal record p 158) that `the [district judge] did not proceed on the basis that he preferred the evidence of Razali and of DW2` but `proceeded on the basis that the appellant, as the investigation officer, had to explain why he did not include P3 in the IP`, and contended that this ran counter to the fundamental principle that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. In our opinion, it is clear from a closer reading of the judgment that the learned judge`s observation, taken in the whole context of that part of his judgment, implied nothing of the sort. The learned judge was simply referring in fact to the need for the appellant, once his defence had been called on, to explain in his own defence why he failed to do what an officer in his position would have done in the normal discharge of his official responsibilities. In fact, the district judge considered at some length the appellant`s evidence both in his examination-in-chief and during his cross-examination: 
 
I considered the evidence adduced on behalf of the accused but did not believe him ... He had given so many reasons as to why he did not include exh P3 (appeal record p 87)
 
 
 
... the court considered his evidence carefully and was satisfied that he had not raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case. He had given a host of reasons which I rejected ... (appeal record p 88)
In our opinion, it is clear that the district judge did not convict the appellant on the basis that it was not for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and accordingly had not misdirected himself in convicting the appellant.
 Question 4 
Mr Rubin submitted that P3 did not `disappear`, because the appellant kept it in his desk drawer, and P3 was produced to the CPIB officer immediately when the appellant was asked about it. He referred us to the definition of the word by the Privy Council in 
 Ratnam 
 
 v 
 
 Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 195
 . In that case, the appellant at the time of his arrest, still had in his office two files, and did not disclose them to the police officers who arrested him and searched his office in pursuance of a search warrant. It was argued that he had committed no offence under s 201, because `disappear` involves removing evidence permanently or for so long that it cannot be used in the legal proceedings to which it was relevant, which was not the case, because the two files were subsequently handed over to the police. The Privy Council explained the meaning of `disappear` in the context of s 201 in the following passage: 
 
The argument on the word `disappear` was based partly on what was alleged to be the ordinary use of that term, namely, `cease to be visible or traceable` - partly on the Indian case of 
 Harbans Lal v The State
 AIR 1967 HP 10. But their Lordships consider that the word `disappear` in s 201 must be contrasted with the words `secrete or des` in s 204.
 
 
 
 
 
 For the purpose of s 201 the degree or length of the secretion of the evidence is immaterial, provided that the evidence in question is for a time caused to escape the vigilance of those who are seeking it as evidence 
 
. This accords with the apparent purpose of the section; and the sense of `disappear` involved is well within the ordinary meaning of the word. Their Lordships do not think that 
 Harbans Lal v The State 
 would necessarily be followed in other jurisdictions. (Emphasis added.)
In the present case, the appellant should have submitted P3 with the investigation papers, but retained it and kept it in his drawer. In our opinion, this was done to keep it from the sight of those to whom it should have been shown, and this was sufficient to bring the action within the meaning and purpose of s 201.
Accordingly, we answer questions 1 and 4 in the affirmative, and questions 2 and 3 in the negative.
 Order accordingly

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an action instituted by the plaintiff against the defendants for malicious prosecution and libel on account of a police report made on 15 March 1983 by the second defendant, on behalf of the first defendant, against the plaintiff. The second defendant was and is a shareholder and director of the first defendant. The second defendant was also at the material time the sole proprietor of Jee Ah Chian & Co, a firm of public accountants.
 Plaintiff`s evidence 
The plaintiff first came to know the second defendant in 1952 when the latter was the book-keeping teacher of the former at the YMCA. They met again in 1967 and from then the plaintiff appointed the second defendant as his consultant to deal with his tax matters. Their relationship from then until the date of the police report was purely professional. They did not have any other social or business dealings.
In 1982, through financial investments, the plaintiff obtained immigrant status in Australia and left for Australia in August that year. A condition of the scheme governing the plaintiff`s immigrant status was that he had to stay for a year in Australia. In order not to affect that status he could only leave Australia during that one year period for good reasons, eg business.
On 9 March 1983 the plaintiff returned to Singato consult the second defendant on his tax matters. Before departing from Australia the plaintiff wrote to the second defendant on 23 February 1983 informing the latter that he would be arriving in Singapore on the evening of 9 March 1983 and that he would be staying here for a week. The plaintiff also requested for an appointment to see the second defendant at 10.15am on 10 March 1983. At the time the plaintiff was still a citizen of Singapore and was (and still is) a shareholder and director of Standard Photo Pte Ltd.
According to the plaintiff, he came to see the second defendant at his office at the appointed time and handed over to the second defendant the books and documents to enable the second defendant to prepare the accounts and the tax returns. The plaintiff was asked to come back on 14 March 1983 to sign the accounts and the tax returns. He left two contact telephone numbers with the second defendant - the office number (2356264) of one Mr Khafi and the office number (2829122) of Standard Photo at MacPherson Road. Mr Khafi was the personal friend of the plaintiff with whom the plaintiff was then staying. The plaintiff could not be sure whether he identified the two places to which the two telephone numbers related.
The plaintiff returned to see the second defendant on 14 March 1983. He said that the second defendant`s table was cluttered with files and papers. He went through the accounts and tax returns with the second defendant and signed them and paid for the services by way of a cheque. A receipt was issued for the payment. When he was about to leave the second defendant`s office, he asked the latter where the toilet was. He left his briefcase in the second defendant`s room. On his return from the toilet, he saw the second defendant opening his drawer and taking out a packet. From the packet the second defendant showed the plaintiff some green stones and said that those were emeralds. The stones were wrapped with a silk type of paper or oily paper. The plaintiff picked up a few of the stones to have a feel. He put the stones back into the paper wrap and the phone rang. The second defendant picked up the phone and the plaintiff then left the second defendant`s office. (I may add that in cross-examination the plaintiff gave a slightly different sequence of events: `Phone rang. I put the stones back. Bid him farewell and left.`) He did not take any of the stones. The plaintiff said that he saw one of the second defendant`s hands was placed on the paper wrap. On this visit on 14 March 1983, the plaintiff did not inform the second defendant the date when he would be returning to Australia.
After leaving the second defendant`s office, the plaintiff went to a couple of other places before returning to the Khafis` residence at 6.15pm. Mrs Khafi told the plaintiff that there was an urgent call from the second defendant at Mr Khafi`s office. He thought it related to his tax matters. As it was past the normal office hours, he decided that he would return the call the next day. The next morning (15 March 1983), a co-director of Standard Photo came to fetch the plaintiff to the Standard Photo main office at MacPherson Road. On arrival he was told that the second defendant was trying to contact him. He called up the second defendant (at about 9.15am) who said this to him, `Hi Robin, you did not return the stones. Unless you return it right away, I am going to report you to the police.` On hearing what the plaintiff said he was astounded and told the second defendant that he must be mad. The plaintiff threatened the second defendant that if he persisted in that accusation, he would take legal action against him. The plaintiff said that he asked the second defendant to wait for him as he was coming right away to confront him with regard to the accusation. The second defendant agreed to wait for him to come over. The plaintiff arrived at the second defendant`s office just before 10am in the company of two co-directors. But the second defendant was not there. They waited for 45 minutes and then the plaintiff received a telephone call from Standard Photo informing him that an Insp Loo from the Central Police Station was looking for him. After speaking to his legal adviser (Mr Elias) on the phone the plaintiff called Insp Loo and made an appointment to see Insp Loo at 4.30pm that afternoon.
In the company of his legal adviser and a co-director, the plaintiff kept his appointment with Insp Loo. When he was interviewed in private by Insp Loo, the plaintiff denied that he had taken the emeralds or that he was running away. The plaintiff also told Insp Loo that he was not leaving on 17 March 1983 but on 20 March 1983. At about 5pm, the second defendant came into Insp Loo`s office and accused him of taking the stones. The plaintiff called the second defendant a liar. After the second defendant left, a statement was taken by Insp Loo from the plaintiff. Insp Loo also prepared a charge of criminal breach of trust against the plaintiff. The plaintiff was arrested and released on bail. He was charged in court on 16 March 1983. On 18 March 1983 the case was fixed for hearing on 29 December 1983; but the court allowed the plaintiff to leave Singapore. In the meantime between 16 and 18 March 1983, there were some discussions between the solicitors of the two parties, initiated by the plaintiff`s solicitor, with the aim of terminating the criminal proceedings and having the dispute be determined in a civil action. And as part of the understanding, the plaintiff would not sue the second defendant on account of the police report. The proposal was that they should make a joint petition to the public prosecutor. However, no agreement could be reached. The plaintiff explained that he was anxious to have the matter sorted out because if he did not return to Australia by a certain date his immigrant status would be adversely affected.
On 4 June 1983, the plaintiff`s solicitor wrote a petition to the Attorney General`s Chambers asking that the charge against the plaintiff be withdrawn. On 15 July 1983, the plaintiff`s solicitor was informed that the charge would be withdrawn. On 7 September 1983 a district court discharged the plaintiff amounting to an acquittal.
The plaintiff said that he first came to know of Sunrise Investments (Pte) Ltd, the first defendant, on seeing the police report made by the second defendant. His dealings were entirely with the second defendant. The plaintiff said that in 1983 he was not dealing in real jewellery. Then his business was in 8mm home movie films, pre-recorded video tapes, imitation jewellery, watches, spare parts and tools. Prior to 1983 he had been dealing in imitation jewellery for 10 to 12 years. Even at the time of his evidence in court, the plaintiff was not dealing with precious stones but in gold and silver jewellery. He had no experience or knowledge of precious stones.
The plaintiff admitted that from 1952 until 1983 their relationship was cordial. There had never been any misunderstanding or ill-will between them though they had no social interaction. From 1967 until 1983, he was satisfied with the second defendant`s work. He had no complaint. The second defendant had never asked him to do anything improper. The plaintiff did not know of any reason why the second defendant would want to harm him. At the time (ie March 1983), the plaintiff was not doing anything in Australia. He told the court that for 15 months from August 1982 (the time he first immigrated there) he was not working and was looking for something to do.
The plaintiff denied the defendants` counsel`s suggestion that the emeralds were packed in a small plastic packet with a small piece of paper in it on which was written the weight, the price and the number of stones therein. He denied that such a packet was handed to him for his visual inspection. He denied that the second defendant had handed to him any emeralds for his decision whether to buy or to return on the same day.
 Defendants` evidence 
In his evidence the second defendant confirmed what the plaintiff said as to how they came to know each other and their subsequent relationship. There had never been any dispute between them. On 10 March 1983, the plaintiff came to see the second defendant with his books and documents to enable the accounts to be prepared and the tax returns completed. The plaintiff left two contact telephone numbers here and also gave his Australian address.
On 14 March 1983 when the plaintiff came to see him, the second defendant said there were five files on his table, two on one side and three on the other. The files/papers on his table were not in a disorderly state. The second defendant explained the accounts and the returns to the plaintiff and the latter appeared happy. The plaintiff asked questions on the accounts. After he signed the accounts and the returns, the second defendant gave him the bill for the services rendered. The plaintiff paid the sum stated in the bill. While they were waiting for the receipt to be issued by the second defendant`s staff, they had a conversation where the plaintiff said that he was looking for business opportunities in Australia especially in jewellery and stones. The second defendant said that he had some emeralds and at the request of the plaintiff, the second defendant took out a small plastic packet containing emeralds and handed it to the plaintiff for his visual inspection. The second defendant told the plaintiff that he could either buy it straight away or decide before the end of the day. Then the phone rang and the second defendant picked it up. While the second defendant was so talking on the phone the plaintiff left the second defendant`s office. The plaintiff did not hand anything back to the second defendant. The second defendant did not notice when the plaintiff left his office. The time then was about 11.30am.
At 12.30pm that afternoon, the second defendant called the plaintiff at the two contact telephone numbers to get his confirmation as to his decision on the emeralds as the plaintiff had left his office without saying anything. At both places the plaintiff was not there and the second defendant left a message for the plaintiff to return the call urgently. The second defendant recognized one of the two telephone numbers as that of Standard Photo. At 2.30pm that same day the second defendant called both the telephone numbers again and still he could not reach the plaintiff. The second defendant again left the same message for the plaintiff to return the call. At about 5pm that same afternoon the second defendant called a third time on the two telephone numbers and the plaintiff was still not there. Again the second defendant left the same message for the plaintiff.
The next morning, 15 March 1983, the second defendant arrived at his office at 8.30am. He said he called the two numbers nine to ten times but the reply was still that the plaintiff was not in. Shortly after that the plaintiff called the second defendant who asked the plaintiff what his decision was on the stones. The plaintiff called the second defendant a mad man and denied receiving the stones; he shouted at the second defendant. There was no appointment for the plaintiff to come to see the second defendant at the latter`s office. Immediately after that telephone conversation the second defendant went to see his solicitor whose office was located on the same floor of the same building. He did so specifically to obtain guidance from his solicitor. He wanted to be careful. His solicitor warned him about the consequences of lodging a police report. With the help of his solicitor, a report, in these terms was lodged by the second defendant: 
 
On 14 March 1983 about 11.30am at the request of Mr Silas Saul Robin (SS Robin) of temporary resident of Australia (NRIC No 1041522/E) I, Lee Boon Chye, on the behalf and for Sunrise Investment (Pte) Ltd handed to him a plastic pack (small) containing 45 pieces cut/polished round emeralds (8.98 carat at $650 = $5,837) for his viewing and return on the same day or immediately for his decision. Mr SS Robin cannot be contacted at the telephones 2829122 and 2356264 given nor return the said emeralds.
 
 
 
Mr SS Robin is expected to fly to Australia on Thursday, 17 March 1983, as our company believes that he is now a temporary resident of Australia.
I lodge this report against Mr SS Robin as I, Lee Boon Chye, acting on behalf of Sunrise Investments (Pte) Ltd believe he may be committing an offence of cheating or criminal breach of trust.
In the afternoon of the same day the police report was made, ie 15 March 1983, the second defendant`s solicitor also wrote a letter to the officer-in-charge of the Central Police Station, which was copied to the Changi Airport Police, the immigration officer at Changi Airport, the public prosecutor`s office and the commercial attache to the Australian High Commission, as follows (2DB13): 
 
We act for Mr Lee Boon Chye of 36 Phillip Street, #02-00 Leong Chuan Building, Singapore 0104.
 
 
 
We repeat that the abovenamed is intending or planning to fly to Australia.
We repeat that the abovenamed is a non-resident in Singapore and is planning to leave Singapore for Australia on Thursday, 17 March 1983.
As stated in the police report, the abovenamed has committed an offence of cheating or criminal breach of trust.
The abovenamed is contactable at telephone No 2829122 or No 2356264 as given by him, or at 565-B, 2nd Floor, MacPherson Road, Singapore 1336, as given by him.
Our client requests that you take steps to arrest the abovenamed before his flight to Australia.
A note was also appended at the bottom of the letter marked for the attention of the two authorities at Changi Airport as follows: 
 
At the airport, please search the above named for a bag of 45 pieces of 8.98 carats of green emeralds. Please check the manifest of passengers from Singapore to Australia today, tomorrow and the day after (Thursday, 17 March 1983).
 
 
 
The second defendant explained that by the last paragraph in the letter, he wanted the police to stop the plaintiff from leaving Singapore. On the advice of his solicitor, the plaintiff had to be arrested. The original of the letter, plus the four copies, were handed by the solicitor to the second defendant who despatched all five copies by hand to Insp Loo at Central Police Station, marked `Private and Confidential`. The carbon copies were not sent out to the carbon copy addresses. They were received by Insp Loo at about 4.30pm. The second defendant explained that he had in that letter asked the airport authorities to search the plaintiff because he was sure that the plaintiff took the emeralds and that they would be on the plaintiff`s body.
The second defendant also told the court that earlier, on 6 March 1983, he made a bulk purchase of a quantity of emeralds totalling approximately 41.86 carats. On 8 March 1983, he repacked them into ten small plastic packets to facilitate handling and sale. His business was mainly on consignment basis. A record was made of the contents of the ten plastic packets: see DB3. He marked each plastic packet personally. The third packet was sold and the fourth was given to the plaintiff. The Strepsils box, which contains the remaining eight packets, was produced to court (marked as exh `D2`). He said that the emeralds were not wrapped with silk or oily paper though there were two such wrappers in the box `D2`. He explained that he did not pack the emeralds in that way because the emeralds, being so small, could easily drop. The empty wrappers were placed in the box just in case a purchaser would want to have them. However, he agreed that precious stones are normally wrapped with such papers.
The second defendants recalled the sale of a bracelet he made to the plaintiff on 11 March 1975. Exhibit `D1` was tendered in support. That sale was made by the second defendant on behalf of the first defendant. The business of the first defendant, which first started in 1966, was carried out by the second defendant and his son (DW2).
In cross-examination the second defendant said that he had other emeralds, apart from those he bought on 6 March 1983, in the safe in his office. He denied there was any mix-up between those he bought on 6 March 1983 and his other emeralds.
On 16 March 1983, pursuant to a request made by the plaintiff`s solicitors, a search of his desk was made by the second defendant. But nothing was found. The second defendant said the search was carried out just to comply with the request of the plaintiff because the second defendant was certain that he did hand the emeralds to the plaintiff who never returned them to him.
 Malicious prosecution: the law 
I will first deal with the claim under malicious prosecution. The essentials that need to be proved by a plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution are succinctly set out in 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1348 as follows: 
 
To succeed in an action for damages for malicious prosecution a plaintiff must prove (1) the prosecution by the defendant of a criminal charge against the plaintiff before a tribunal into whose proceedings the criminal courts are competent to inquire; (2) that the proceedings complained of terminated in the plaintiff`s favour; (3) that the defendant instituted or carried on the proceedings maliciously; (4) that there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause for the proceedings; and (5) that the plaintiff has suffered damage.
 
 
 
In relation to our present action it has not been argued that essentials (1), (2) and (5) have not been proven. The contentions centred on essentials (3) and (4) which are invariably the two most difficult questions in an action for malicious prosecution. Acquittal on a charge does not mean that the institution of the criminal proceedings was necessarily without reasonable and probable cause. This comes out loud and clear from the decision of Brett MR in 
 Abrath 
 
 v 
 
 North Eastern Railway Co 
 
(1883) 11 QBD 440
 where he said at p 448 as follows: 
 
It is not enough for the plaintiff to show, in order to support the claim which he has made, that he was innocent of the charge upon which he was tried; he has to show that the prosecution was instituted against him by the defendants without any reasonable or probable cause and with a malicious intention in the mind of the defendants, that is, not with the mere intention of carrying the law into effect, but with an intention which was wrongful in point of fact. It has been decided over and over again that all these points must be established by the plaintiff, and that the burden of each of them lies upon the plaintiff.
 
 
 
What will constitute want of reasonable and probable cause and malice will have to depend on the circumstances of the case. As was so aptly observed by Tindal CJ in 
 Willans 
 v 
 Taylor 
 (1829) 6 Bing 182 at p 186; 130 ER 1250: 
 
What shall amount to such a combination of malice and want of probable cause is so much a matter of fact in each individual case as to render it impossible to lay down any general rule on the subject; but there ought to be enough to satisfy a reasonable man that the accuser had no ground for proceeding but his desire to injure the accused.
 
 
 
However, if reasonable and probable cause is established, it does not matter whether there is or is no malice. As Denning LJ stated in 
 Tempest 
 v 
 Snowden 
 
[1952] 1 KB 130
 at p 140: `Even though a prosecutor is actuated by the most express malice, nevertheless he is not liable so long as there was reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution.` Therefore, a plaintiff who proves malice but not want of reasonable and probable cause still fails. `There must be a concurrence of malice in the defendant and want of probable cause` - Tindal CJ in 
 Willans 
. Want of reasonable and probable cause does not per se amount to malice; but malice may be inferred therefrom.
 Assessment of the evidence 
Let me first set out briefly the obviously undisputed facts that emerged from the evidence of both the plaintiff and the second defendant. They first came to know each other in 1952. In 1967 the plaintiff appointed the second defendant as his tax consultant and this relationship, which was cordial, continued until the occurrence of the incident in March 1983 which formed the subject of this action. Until then, both parties had no complaint against each other. There was nothing unharmonious in their relationship. But it was a purely professional relationship as they did not socialize on a personal level. The event on 15 March 1983 was the first time that the second defendant had made any criminal or unfriendly allegation against the plaintiff.
In the letter of 23 February 1983, the plaintiff sought an appointment to see the second defendant on 10 March 1983. The letter also mentioned that the plaintiff would be in Singapore for a week. On the appointed day, the plaintiff came to see the second defendant on his tax matters. He gave the second defendant two contact telephone numbers. One was that of Standard Photo at MacPherson Road though the plaintiff did not tell the second defendant where the place of the second telephone number was. On 14 March 1983 the plaintiff returned to the second defendant`s office and after being satisfied with the tax papers prepared by the second defendant, signed them. There is a discrepancy in the evidence as to whether the plaintiff did ask the second defendant questions on the accounts. But I do not think that this point is material for our present purposes. The plaintiff paid for the services of the second defendant. What happened thereafter is the matter in dispute.
I find, on the evidence, that after the two had finished with the tax matters and while waiting for the preparation of the receipt, they must have had a chat about what the plaintiff was doing in Australia. To my mind, that was only natural. The second defendant said that the plaintiff informed him that the plaintiff was looking for business opportunities in Australia especially in jewellery and stones. I am inclined to think that this was likely to be true since the plaintiff has told the court that he is now in the gold and silver jewellery business, which is a somewhat similar kind of business. It must be in that kind of a context that the second defendant took out the emeralds from his drawer to show to the plaintiff. In this regard there is that evidence from the plaintiff that before he left the second defendant`s office, he went to use the toilet. It is probably true that sometime that morning the plaintiff did go to the toilet. But this point does not seem to me to be material.
The plaintiff said that the emeralds were wrapped in the oily type of paper. On the other hand, the second defendant said that they were wrapped in a small plastic packet, like the remaining eight packets in exh `D2`. He explained that the emeralds were wrapped in that way to prevent accidental loss as the emeralds were very small articles. The plaintiff said that he took a few emeralds from the oily paper wrap to have a feel. However, the second defendant said that he handed a plastic packet containing emeralds, which was the packet marked as No 4 in DB3, to the plaintiff for him to have a visual inspection. The plaintiff said that the second defendant`s desk was cluttered with files whereas the second defendant said he had only five files on his table: three on one side and two on the other. Notwithstanding these contradictions in the evidence, one incontrovertible fact emerges and that is, that emeralds were in fact shown to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff said he had replaced the emeralds which he picked up to feel and then the phone rang. As I have pointed out above, in cross-examination the plaintiff seemed to say that the phone rang first. The second defendant answered it and the plaintiff left. The plaintiff did not take the emeralds with him. On the other hand, the second defendant said that after he handed the plastic packet of emeralds to the plaintiff he told the plaintiff that he could either buy them straight away or he could decide before the end of the day. Then the phone rang and the second defendant picked it up. Without the second defendant noticing, the plaintiff left the second defendant`s office without saying whether he was taking the emeralds straight away or he would decide before the end of the day. On this aspect of the evidence there are two common facts - one, the phone rang soon after the emeralds were shown to the plaintiff; two, the plaintiff left the office soon after the phone rang.
DB3, which sets out the detailed particulars of the ten packets, was not accepted by the plaintiff`s counsel. He suggested that DB3 could well be prepared after the event or shortly before the trial. But there is one point which runs counter to that suggestion and this point is there is both the police report and the letter dated 15 March 1983 (2DB13). In both these two documents there is a reference to 45 pieces of 8.98 carats of emeralds. It seems to me clear that such precise particulars could only be furnished based on some record. I find that that record must be DB3. I am satisfied that DB3 was prepared by the second defendant on 8 March 1983 when he separated the emeralds he bought in bulk on 6 March 1983 into ten lots based mainly on size. I am also inclined to accept the second defendant`s evidence that each of the lots were wrapped in a small plastic packet to facilitate easy handling and prevent accidental dropping of any stones. They were not wrapped in the oily paper. Even the plaintiff agreed that the oily paper is stiff and if pressed `the stones would jump`.
I must also add that I am much impressed by the fact that the second defendant made three calls to each of the two contact numbers that day to try to reach the plaintiff to get his confirmation on the emeralds. Several calls were also made by the second defendant on the morning of 15 March 1983. Though there is a discrepancy in his evidence regarding the number of calls the second defendant made that morning, I do not think that matters too much. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that these calls merely go to show that the second defendant having lost or misplaced the emeralds sought to check with the plaintiff whether he had taken them. But on the plaintiff`s own evidence, when he eventually contacted the second defendant on the morning of 15 March 1983, the first thing the second defendant said was: `Hi Robin, you did not return the stones. Unless you return it right away, I am going to report you to the police.` These words do not seem to me to show that of a person who was not sure but a person who was convinced, rightly or wrongly, that the plaintiff had taken the emeralds. And of course the response of the plaintiff by calling the second defendant a mad man and threatening to sue did not help to allay the worst fears of the second defendant. Such utterance could only have a negative effect on the second defendant. A better and constructive response would have been for the plaintiff to explain what he did to the emeralds after feeling them, recall the events the day before and perhaps ask the second defendant to do a search. That would have been more helpful and removed whatever fears then present in the second defendant`s mind.
There is one other point concerning the telephone conversation on 15 March 1983. I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that he told the second defendant that he would be coming over to the latter`s office to confront him on the accusation. However, in view of the rather heated exchange that had taken place between them on the telephone, I doubt there was any firm understanding that the second defendant would wait for the plaintiff to come over for a confrontation before he would take any further steps in the matter.
On the evidence I am satisfied that the first defendant had been in the precious stones business for sometime before 1983, that the second defendant did on behalf of the first defendant buy a quantity of emeralds from a seller on 6 March 1983 and that he repacked them into ten plastic packets according to size. I find that arising out of their chat of what the plaintiff was doing in Australia, and pursuant to at least an implied request, the second defendant showed the plaintiff the packet of emeralds saying he could buy them straight away or he could decide at the end of the day or words to that effect. It is possible that the plaintiff might not have heard completely what the second defendant had said. At that very moment the phone rang. Before leaving, the plaintiff probably did bid the second defendant farewell and could have placed the plastic packet, which was really quite small, somewhere on the table. There were files on the table; I do not think it is necessary for me to determine how many. But because the second defendant was concentrating on what he was talking on the telephone, he probably did not hear the plaintiff and did not observe what the plaintiff did with the packet of emeralds. I think the plaintiff could have been mistaken about how the emeralds were wrapped because there were two empty oily wrappers in exh `D2`. I should like to add that in reaching the foregoing findings, I placed no reliance on the alleged sale of a bracelet by the second defendant to the plaintiff in 1975. That is really quite insignificant. If the plaintiff had forgotten about that transaction, I can`t really fault him. The transaction was just too long ago to expect him to remember.
Counsel for the plaintiff also relied on DB2 to say that the second defendant did not in fact lose any stones. He argued that as DB2 stated that one Steve Papps sold 175 emeralds to the second defendant and as the second defendant now still has more than 175 emeralds in the remaining eight packets in exh `D2` that means that the second defendant has lost nothing. In fact he has more. However, having considered DB3 and the second defendant`s evidence on this, including the element of weight, it is clear that the figure 175 is a mistake. It should have been 275. Incidentally there was another error in DB2 but that was corrected. Counsel for the plaintiff also showed that in packets No 9 and No 10, the number of emeralds contained in each of them was one short of what was stated on each packet (49 instead of 50 and 25 instead of 26). It seems to me that those were probably due to counting errors. In cross-examination, the plaintiff`s counsel also attempted to show that the way in which the second defendant kept his record of the precious stones was not very satisfactory. I have carefully considered these points but I not think they materially affect the case.
I turn next to examine the police report lodged by the plaintiff. The complaints of the plaintiff on the report are broadly these: (i) it was not true that the plaintiff `requested` to see the emeralds; (ii) the second defendant had failed to state in the report that the plaintiff had contacted him that morning and denied taking the emeralds; (iii) it was not true that the plaintiff could not be contacted at the two telephone numbers; (iv) the plaintiff was not flying off on 17 March 1983; (v) the plaintiff was not a temporary resident of Australia but was an immigrant. On (i), as I have stated above, there was in the context of the circumstances at least an implied request to see the emeralds. On (ii), I agree that the second defendant should have stated that the plaintiff did finally contact him that morning and he denied taking the stones. But as the second defendant would be questioned (as advised by his solicitor) on the report by the police officer, I do not think this omission materially affected the thrust of the report or indicated any improper motive. After all, he also knew that the plaintiff would be given a chance to explain by the police officer. His main concern was obviously to recover the emeralds. As regards (iii), in a sense it is true that his attempts to reach the plaintiff at the two numbers were not successful. This point is really connected to point (ii). As regards (iv), the date of the plaintiff`s departure, I would not say that it was erroneous, bearing in mind that the second defendant was told by the plaintiff that he would be in Singapore for a week. As regards (v), I do not think it was wrong to describe the plaintiff as a temporary resident of Australia. The second defendant said that the plaintiff had once told him that the plaintiff might come back to Singapore. As I understand it, the plaintiff was given permanent resident status, subject to conditions.
Therefore, looking at the police report as a whole and bearing in mind that the second defendant was aware that he himself would be questioned on the report and the plaintiff would also be given a chance to explain, I do not think the wording of the report or any omission therein could reasonably be construed to suggest any improper intention or motive.
Finally, I turn to the letter of the same date written by the second defendant`s solicitor. It was obviously written on the premise that the police had still not located the plaintiff, otherwise there would have been no need to ask the airport authorities to check the manifest of passengers on flights from Singapore to Australia for that day and the next two days and to arrest the plaintiff. What this letter shows was an aggrieved complainant who wanted the police to act with due despatch. He wanted the wrongdoer to be brought to justice and did not want to see the plaintiff (whom he bona fide believed took the emeralds) slip out of Singa. It was suggested by the plaintiff that this letter shows bad motive as it sought to apply pressure on the police. Furthermore, the fact that it was copied to four other parties also indicates malice. I do not think that necessarily follows. A party who is convinced that someone else has taken his things is entitled to pursue his case vigorously.
As regards the four carbon copy addresses, the relevance of the first three seems obvious to me. The copy to the Australian High Commission was of course to inform the Australian government that the plaintiff had committed an offence so that if the plaintiff should escape from Singapore to Australia, steps could be taken to bring him back to justice. Therefore, the four addresses were not uninterested persons. Further, to copy the letter to the four addresses was the idea of his solicitor to which the second defendant agreed. In any event and equally important, the four copies were never despatched to the four addressees. They were all given, together with the original, to Insp Loo, leaving it to him to decide whether there was a need to despatch them to any of the four addresses. This is not the attitude of a person who wished to cause harm to the plaintiff indiscriminately. Since at the time the letter and the copies arrived at Insp Loo`s office, the plaintiff was already before Insp Loo, I think it would be fair to assume that (though there is no direct evidence here) Insp Loo would not have despatched them to the four addressees as there would have been no point in sending out those copies. The police investigation papers on the case had been destroyed. In this connection I note that when the plaintiff eventually left Singapore on 20 March 1983 he was not searched.
Having carefully reviewed and examined the evidence as a whole, on balance I would be inclined to think that there was some reasonable and probable cause for the second defendant to have lodged the police report. In 
 Abrath v North Eastern Railway Co 
 
(1883) 11 QBD 440
, Cave J left this question to the jury: `Did (the defendants) honestly believe the case which they laid before the magistrates?` On the facts of our present case, I think the answer to the question is in the affirmative. The report lodged by the second defendant did not rest on mere suspicion. It was based on direct personal interaction between the second defendant and the plaintiff. Though a few discrepancies or unsatisfactory answers in the evidence of the second defendant were pointed out by the plaintiff`s counsel (eg number of calls he made on 15 March 1983; said he did not want the police to arrest the plaintiff and yet something different was stated in the last paragraph of the letter dated 15 March 1983; said he was not prepared to call the plaintiff a thief until the police investigated, yet see letter of 15 March 1983), I do not think these points affected the overall picture. They are, in my view, not really that significant. He had, in any case, explained that he was advised by his solicitor that to stop the plaintiff from leaving Singapore at the airport, the plaintiff had to be arrested. I am unable to find any motive for the second defendant wanting to accuse the plaintiff of the offence other than the fact that he genuinely thought that the plaintiff had taken the emeralds. He even consulted his solicitor before making the report. I am conscious that mere consultation with a solicitor does not convert a report, which is not otherwise based on reasonable and probable cause, into a report which is so based. But this is certainly a factor in the overall assessment.
In reaching my conclusion that the second defendant acted on reasonable and probable cause, I have borne in mind the following views expressed by Hawkin J in 
 Hicks v Faulkner 
 
(1878) 8 QBD 167
 at p 171, which were subsequently approved by the House of Lords in 
 Herniman v Smith 
 
[1938] AC 305
: 
 
I should define reasonable and probable cause to be, an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed.
 
 
 
However, should I be wrong to hold that there was reasonable and probable cause, I am satisfied that in the circumstances the report was not lodged with any malice, ie presence of spite, ill-will or some improper and indirect motives. I am satisfied that the second defendant honestly thought that the plaintiff took the emeralds. As I have pointed out, the response of the plaintiff over the telephone on the morning of 15 March 1983 did not help matters but aggravated the situation. There could have been a bona fide mistake on the second defendant`s part as regards the question whether the plaintiff did place the packet of emeralds on the table before he left; but that in no way suggested malice. More importantly, the second defendant did not act just on his own. As I have said, he took the precaution of consulting his solicitor before making the report. He was appraised of the consequences that would follow. There is nothing to suggest that in making the report the intention of the second defendant was not to recover the emeralds but to cause wrongful harm to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff`s counsel has also submitted that the refusal of the second defendant to jointly petition the public prosecutor to have the charge withdrawn and to allow the dispute to be resolved in a civil action indicated malice. Now if the second defendant honestly thought, based on facts within his knowledge, that an offence had been committed I do not see why he should be obliged to make such a joint petition and if he did not do so that would be evidence of malice. He took this stand after obtaining advice from his solicitor. There is nothing to stop an accused person from submitting his own petition, which was what the plaintiff did. We do not know why the public prosecutor withdrew the charge. I assume one or more of the reasons given in the petition must have found favour with the public prosecutor or it could be a case where the public prosecutor had decided to give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff.
This is, in my view, a truly unfortunate case. A cordial relationship which spanned over a period of more than 30 years was brought to an abrupt and unpleasant end through a regrettable incident. Both are respectable individuals. I have given this matter the most anxious consideration but I cannot find a motive for the second defendant in wanting to cause wrongful harm to the plaintiff. The second defendant is a professional person. This is not a case where, out of the blue, an allegation like that was made.
Counsel for the plaintiff suggested this motive. The second defendant had lost the emeralds and would have to account to the shareholders of the first defendant; thus he put the blame on the plaintiff. If that were in fact the motive then it was absolutely low down. But considering the circumstances, I do not think this is likely to be the case. Unless a person has lost his mind, I do not see him putting a blame of this kind on someone with whom the person has 30 years of cordial relationship. There is no suggestion that the second defendant has lost his mind. The first defendant was after all a family company of which the second defendant was the main shareholder. The amount involved was not even large. If this suggested motive were in fact the real reason for making the police report then having done so I would have thought that he would more likely have agreed to submitting the joint petition to the public prosecutor, having already achieved his purpose. To my mind it is clear that a combination of a number of circumstances brought about this unfortunate turn of events and caused a cordial relationship to turn sour.
In the event, I dismiss the claim based on malicious prosecution. As regards the claim based on defamation, there can be no doubt that to accuse a person of having committed the crime of cheating or criminal breach of trust is defamatory. For the present purposes I need only consider the defence of qualified privilege. Counsel for the plaintiff conceded, and quite rightly so, that the police report and the letter of 15 March 1983 were written on an occasion of qualified privilege: 
 Collins v Cooper 
 (1902) 19 TLR 118. To succeed in the action, the plaintiff must show that the second defendant was actuated by express malice, that is to say by spite or ill-will or some other wrong or improper motive: 
 Bowles v Armstrong 
(1913) 32 NZLR 409. For the same reasons indicated above, I am satisfied that no malice was shown and therefore, the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
There remains the question of the counterclaim by the second defendant for the return of the emeralds. Having heard both the plaintiff and the second defendant, I am inclined, on balance, to hold that the second defendant has not proven that the plaintiff had taken away the packet of emeralds which was handed to him for his visual inspection. The second defendant did not see the plaintiff leave his office with the emeralds. The plaintiff said that he had left the emeralds on the table. It is not for me to speculate what could have happened to the packet that was probably left on the table. The burden of proof is on the second defendant to show that the plaintiff had taken the emeralds away and he has not discharged that burden. I accordingly dismiss the counterclaim.
There is one other matter which I ought to allude to before I conclude this judgment. This relates to a telephone call which the son (DW2) of the second defendant made to the plaintiff in Australia in 1987 with the aim of exploring a compromise and bringing this action to an end. The son said that he made the call because the second defendant was then about to undergo a major operation, following the results of some tests. The second defendant knew that the son would be making the call. I do not think anything should reasonably be drawn against the second defendant on that account.
Finally, as regards costs, considering all the circumstances, I think the ends of justice would be met in this case if I should order that each party bear his own costs and I do so order.
 Order accordingly

Whether the use of the words 'yang ming jiu' (in Chinese characters) by the defendants to describe their Chinese wines infringed the plaintiffs' registered mark 'yang ming jiu Yomeishu' (bearing the same Chinese characters) for Japanese wine
 
This is a motion by the plaintiffs for an order to restrain the defendants until trial or further order from selling, offering for sale, importing distributing, or dealing with in any manner wine or medicated wine products bearing the mark or name `` and/or `Yangmingjiu` which have no connection in the course of the plaintiffs` trade, and an ancillary order for delivery up to the plaintiffs for their safe custody any such wine or medicated wine products.
In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs have pleaded that they are the registered proprietors in Singapore of the trade mark (the registered mark) consisting of ` Yomeishu` which is registered as (i) TM No 1400/80 in Part A of the Register from 5 April 1980 in Class 5 in respect of wines, spirits (beverages) and liqueurs, all being medicated, and (ii) TM No 1401/90 in Part A of the Register from 5 April 1980 in respect of wines (with the exception of medicated wines) and spirits (drinks). The registered mark is current and subsisting.
In this action, they claim that the defendants have infringed the registered mark in selling a medicated wine (the Chinese wine) under the name `Chinese Yangmingjiu` or ``. Alternatively, they also claim in passing-off. The second plaintiffs are the sole importer and agent in Singapore of the first plaintiffs in respect of their medicated wine. They claim an interim injunction in terms I have set out.
The material facts are as follows. The first plaintiffs claim that their predecessors in title have been selling since 1602, a unique medicated wine (which I shall refer to as the Japanese wine) known by the Japanese/Chinese written characters as `` or phonetically as `Yomeishu` if the characters are read in Japanese, or known phonetically as `Yangmingjiu` if the characters are read in Mandarin. I shall refer to this wine as `the Japanese wine`. They have produced in evidence a document dated March 1813 which referred to the Japanese wine as ``.
The first plaintiffs say that the Japanese wine has been imported into and sold in Singapore since 1970 and advertised since 1973.
In March 1981, the defendants started importing and selling the Chinese wine under the `Huang He Lou ` (Yellow Crane Tower) brand which was manufactured in China by Huangshi Drink Factory of Hubei Province, and exported to Singapore by an organization known as China National Native Produce and Animal By-Products Import and Export Corp, Hubei Native Produce Branch. The Chinese wine was imported into Singapore in bottles each bearing a label with the English words `Chinese Yangmingjiu` and below them the Chinese characters ``. In between, in smaller letters were the words/characters for the brand name. The bottles were sold in boxes also containing all these features, with the words/characters in gold against a red background.
The defendants obtained exclusive distribution rights to the Chinese wine under an agreement dated 22 September 1981. They then began to advertise the Chinese wine in the Chinese newspapers in Singapore, as a result of which the first plaintiffs came to know of the competition from the Chinese wine.
On 7 July 1981, M/s Donaldson & Burkinshaw (D & B), the first plaintiffs` solicitors, wrote to the defendants and, after stating that the word `Yomeishu` had been registered as a trade mark in Class A since 1970 and that they had pending applications for ` Yomeishu` in Class B for medicated wines, claimed that they had the exclusive right to the use of the characters `` which were the `Chinese phonetic equivalent of our ... registered trade mark `Yomeishu``, and that `these characters have through long use and extensive advertising come to be associated in the mind of the trade and public exclusively with our clients` herbal tonic or wine and none other`. They threatened to institute legal proceedings unless the defendants ceased their business in respect of the Chinese wine.
The defendants replied on 22 July 1981 that the Chinese characters meant `life preserving/prolonging wine` and were therefore ordinary descriptive words which could not have become associated exclusively with the Japanese wine. The defendants refused to comply with the first plaintiffs` demand, saying that they would reserve the right to object to the registration of the said characters as a trade mark. The defendants followed this up with their solicitors` letter of 4 October 1981 repeating the same stand.
On 22 May 1982, the first plaintiffs` solicitors informed the defendants that their clients were the registered proprietors of the mark in Part A in respect of the characters `` in Class 5 (Reg No 1101071) and Class 33 (Reg No 1101072) in the United Kingdom (UK), and that accordingly the mark would be treated as a distinctive mark and would be accepted for registration under the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) (the Act). After pointing out that their clients had registered the phonetic equivalents of `YO` and `MEI` in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Sarawak, Canada and the United States, they reiterated the threat of legal proceedings.
However, after obtaining registration in Singapore, the first plaintiffs ceased and desisted from threatening the defendants for a period of more than seven years. It was not until 15 August 1989 that D & B sent another `cease and desist` letter to the defendants in respect of the sale by them of the Chinese wine. The first plaintiffs have given a number of reasons for the period of inaction. I shall comment on it later when dealing with the balance of convenience. At this juncture, it may be convenient to consider how the first plaintiffs came to register `` as a trade mark in Part A of the United Kingdom Register.
 Registration of ` 
 ` in the United Kingdom 
On 29 August 1978, the first plaintiffs` trade mark agents, Wenping & Co (Wenping) instructed trade mark agents in Glasgow, M/s Fitzpatricks, to file applications to register the word `Yomeishu` in its transliterated form, `` in Class 5 and Class 33 under Part A of the Trade Marks Register. The word `Yomeishu` had already been registered as a UK mark in 1975. The applications were duly filed on 5 September 1978 and on 13 December 1978, the registrar requested a transliteration of the characters and the 
 meaning 
 thereof. On 18 December 1978, Fitzpatricks passed this request on to Wenping but omitted to ask the 
 meaning 
 of the characters. On 11 January 1979, Wenping replied that the Chinese characters were a phonetic equivalent of `Yomeishu`, but did not say whether they had any meaning. Fitzpatricks relayed the information to the registrar on 1 February 1979. On 16 May 1979, the registrar notified Fitzpatricks that the applications, if they proceeded, should be treated as associated trade marks with the mark `Yomeishu` already registered under Reg Nos 1034710 and 1034709, that the applications be amended as indicated (in the reply) and the registrations be endorsed (the endorsement) with the following clause: 
 
The transliteration of the Japanese characters of which the mark consists is `Yomeishu` which has no meaning.
 
 
 
By a letter dated 18 May 1979, Fitzpatricks notified Wenping of the registrar`s conditions and said that they would proceed to confirm the acceptability of the amendments. They however appeared to have, again, omitted informing Wenping of the terms of the endorsement. Eventually, on 6 September 1979, Fitzpatricks forwarded to Wenping photocopies of the advertisements of the marks in the O
 fficial Journal 
 of 5 September 1979, which advertisements contained the endorsement required by the registrar.
 Registration of ` 
 Yomeishu` in Singapore 
On 14 March 1980, Wenping instructed D & B to register the words ` Yomeishu` in Singapore in Part B of the register for wines in Class 5 and Class 33. The following specific instructions were given: 
 
These new applications are to be filed in Part B of register. Our clients are now preparing evidences of use to establish the distinctiveness of the marks, which will be sent to you when the registrar requires. Points to bear in mind that our clients do want to avoid the deletion of Chinese equivalent like their pending applications` case.
 
 
 
The applications were duly filed on 5 April 1980. On 14 November 1981, D & B informed Wenping that the registrar had requested the filing of evidence of long and substantial use of the mark in Singapore. Such evidence was never filed, as on 8 January 1982, D & B informed the registrar that `` had been registered in Part A of the Register of Trade Marks in the United Kingdom and requested that the application be amended to Part A. On 16 October 1982, D & B informed the first plaintiffs that the registrar had accepted the mark for advertisement on the following terms: 
 
In accepting the mark for advertisement, the registrar has imposed the following disclaimer:
 
 
 
`The transliteration of the Japanese characters appearing in the mark in `Yomeishu` which has no meaning.`
 
 
 
In addition, this mark is to be associated with No 77516 and others.
 
 
 
Kindly confirm that the afore-mentioned conditions are acceptable to you.
As the registrations were advertised in the Government Gazette on 29 April 1983 (Class 5) and on 5 August 1983 (Class 33), the presumption must be that the first plaintiffs did accept the registrar`s conditions.
 Action for infringement 
The plaintiffs` case in infringement is based on the registered mark. As registration gives prima facie validity (s 47 of the Act), they should be entitled to an interim injunction to restrain the defendants from infringing their mark in using and continuing to use the works `` to describe the Chinese wine. They also rely on s 48 which gives, after seven years, conclusive validity to the mark `in all respects`. The defendants` case, in so far as this motion is concerned, is that, inter alia, the first plaintiffs` original UK registration was obtained by fraud, and therefore the registration in Singapore was not conclusive against the defendants by virtue of s 48. The defendants have raised other defences but fraud is the main defence in this application.
Section 48 provides as follows: 
 
In all legal proceedings relating to a trade mark registered under this Act in Part A of the register (including applications under s 39) the original registration in Part A of the register of the trade mark shall after the expiration of seven years from the date of the original registration be taken to be valid in all respects unless the original registration was obtained by fraud or unless the trade mark offends against s 15:
 
 
 
Provided that nothing in this Act shall entitle the proprietor or a registered user of a registered trade mark to restrain the use by any person of a trade mark identical with or nearly resembling it in relation to goods in relation to which that person or a predecessor in title of his has continuously used that trade mark from a date anterior -
 
 
(a) to the use of the first-mentioned trade mark in relation to those goods by the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his; or 
 
(b) to the registration of the first-mentioned trade mark in respect of those goods in the name of the proprietor or a predecessor in title of his,
  
 
 
whichever is the earlier, or to object (on such use being proved) to that person being put on the register for that identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under s 25.
 
 
 
 
 
 Descriptive words and distinctiveness 
 
 
 
The issue of fraud arises in connection with the question whether the characters `` were descriptive words which were not distinctive in relation to the first plaintiffs` wine when registration was obtained in Singapore. Under s 10 of the Act, a word or words which have a direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, (ie descriptive words) is/are not registerable under Part A except upon evidence of distinctiveness. `There is no absolute incompatibility between what is descriptive and what is distinctive` (per Fletcher Moulton LJ in 
 Re Joseph Crosfield and Sons Ltd 
[1910] 1 Ch 130 at p 145, approved by the Privy Council in 
 De Cordova 
 
 v 
 
 Vick Chemical Co 
(1951) 68 RPC 103 at p 106). It is thus settled law that distinctiveness in relation to the use of descriptive words may be satisfied by adducing evidence that the words have acquired a secondary meaning in connection with the goods of the claimant. But, as the law does not permit any person to claim a proprietary right to the use of common words in a language, it is extremely difficult to establish that common words have acquired a secondary meaning in relation to the goods of the claimant. There are degrees of difficulty in proving a secondary meaning. In the 
 Vick Chemical 
 case (concerning the well-known ointment, VapoRub), the Privy Council said: 
 
But if a word or words are merely descriptive, in the sense that `cellular cloth` or `shredded wheat` were said to be merely descriptive in the well-known cases in which their significance was the subject of judicial decision, then it would follow the use of such words by one trader in his mark could not amount to an infringement of the mark of another trader, even if the words formed part of the mark. For no court could conclude that they amounted to one of its essential features and thus sanction just that encroachment on the common of the English language which the law has always refused to permit.
 
 
 
In this case, it would be an abuse of language to place a fancy word such as `VapoRub` in the same descriptive class as such phrases as `malted milk` or `shredded wheat`. This much can be said, that the word has a descriptive element: for it is a compound of two ordinary English words which were chosen for the purpose of suggesting to the reader leading characteristics of the substance sold.
If the words `` mean `life nourishing wine`, as the defendants say they mean to a literate Chinese, then they would fall within the category of expressions like `shredded wheat` and `malted milk` and not `VapoRub`. In the `shredded wheat` case, 
 Canadian Shredded Wheat Co Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 Kellogg Co of Canada Ltd 
[1938] 1 All ER 618
 , 
 the facts of the case and the decision of Privy Council are succinctly set out in the headnote as follows: 
 
The appellant company for over 30 years have manufactured and sold a product known as shredded wheat, and, until 1914, when the patent expired, were the sole vendors of the article in Canada. The apparatus for the manufacture of the product was also protected by patent, which expired in 1919, when the appellants` monopoly ceased. The appellant company had registered in 1928 the words `shredded wheat` as their trade mark to be applied to the sale of biscuits and crackers, and in 1929 the same words were registered as their trade mark to be applied to the sale of cereal foods. The respondent company in 1934 commenced to sell in Canada biscuits of shredded wheat made by substantially the same process. The biscuit was of the same shape as, but smaller than, that made by appellant company, and the carton in which the biscuits were contained was quite different from that used by the appellants. The appellants claimed an injunction to restrain the respondents from infringing their registered trade mark `shredded wheat`, and alternatively, an injunction to restrain the resfrom, by a use of the same words or any words only colourably differing therefrom, passing off their biscuits as the appellant company`s biscuits: Held: (i) the appellants were in no way using the words `shredded wheat` as indicative of the origin of the goods contained in their carton, but only as descriptive of those goods. The words, which were both the name of, and descriptive of, the invented product, had not acquired the secondary meaning of being distinctive of goods manufactured exclusively by the appellant company, and this was clear from the use made of them by the company in their cartons and advertisements. The requisite secondary meaning of exclusive distinctiveness had not been established. The registration of the appellant company`s trade mark `shredded wheat` was invalid, and the action for infringement failed. (ii) 
 Once it was established, as here, that the words `shredded wheat` were both the name of a product and descriptive of it, an action for passing off through the use of those words must fail
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
At p 631B-G of the judgment, the Privy Council said: 
 
It must be remembered that `shredded wheat` was not only the name given by the inventor to a new product which could be baked into a biscuit, but was also descriptive of the product as to both its composition and its appearance. It must also be remembered that for a lengthy period the plaintiff company enjoyed a legal monopoly of making and selling in Canada the product shredded wheat baked into biscuits, and that, with the negligible exception of some shredded wheat biscuits called muffets, the plaintiff company continued to be the sole maker of the product, baked or otherwise. In these circumstances, it was inevitable that the words `shredded wheat` and shredded wheat biscuits should become associated in Canada with the goods of the plaintiff company, since many members of the public would get to know that the product shredded wheat was in fact the plaintiff company`s product.
 
 
 
This, however, is far from establishing the required meaning of distinctiveness, which must carry with it the feature that the goods distinguished are the goods manufactured by a particular person, and by no other. 
 A word, or words, to be really distinctive of a person`s goods, must, generally speaking, be incapable of application to the goods of anyone else 
. It is on this point that the evidence breaks down. It is full of ambiguities. One is left in doubt as to whether a witness, in speaking of shredded wheat, refers to the baked biscuit or to the material of which it is composed, and the answers of many are inconsistent with the witness really believing that the words `shredded wheat` necessarily indicate goods manufactured by the plaintiff company exclusively, and by no one else. (Emphasis added.)
The principles applied in these cases concerning the English language apply with equal force to any other language in common use in any country. In Singapore it would obviously apply to the Chinese, Tamil or Malay language. In 
 McAlister & Co Ltd v Pasuma (1960) Ltd & Ors 
 
 
[1961] MLJ 298
 
 , 
 counsel for M conceded that the Chinese characters in question were descriptive and the only question was whether they had acquired a secondary meaning. There, M had been importing and selling since 1957 in large quantities in Singapore and Malaya essence of chicken under the `Apollo` brand. When rendered into Chinese, `Apollo` was read as `Yi-Po-Ly` (in Mandarin) and meant `beneficial for restoring strength`. They had also advertised their product as `Apollo` brand together with the Chinese characters `Yi-Po-Ly`. P started to sell in 1961 essence of chicken under the name of `Yipoly` but they rendered it into Chinese as `I-Pu-Li` and only two of the Chinese characters were the same as those used by the plaintiffs. M`s counsel conceded that the Chinese characters `Yi-Po-Li` used by them were deswords. The court held that M had failed to prove that the Chinese characters `Yi-Po-Li` had acquired a secondary meaning and dismissed their claim for an injunction to restrain P from using `Yi-Pu-Li`.
I return to ``. In para 2 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs say: 
 
The name `` consists of three Chinese characters which are also used in the Japanese written language. Although each character has a meaning by itself, the unique combination of ` ` is an invention of the founder of the said medicated wine, the said Sokan Shiozawa. The combined word `` has no official meaning and is not found in any known Chinese or Japanese dictionary or encyclopaedia. The names `Yomeishu` and `Yangmingjiu` are English phonetic equivalents or transliteration of the word ``. These English phonetic equivalents also have no meaning in English.
 
 
 
Paragraph 2 acknowledges that `` are Chinese characters which are also part of the Japanese language and that each character has a meaning. This must mean that to a Japanese, each word has a meaning and also to a Chinese literate in Chinese each word also has a meaning. It is common ground that to a Japanese and a Chinese, each character in `` has more or less the same meaning, as its origin is Chinese and the Chinese language has been adopted as part of the Japanese written language. It is not clear what the first plaintiffs mean when they say that `` in that combination (the expression) has no 
 official meaning 
.
The first plaintiffs also say that the words `Yomeishu` and `Yangmingjiu` are English phonetic equivalents or transliterations of the expression, which they also claim their predecessor in title invented in the 17th century to describe the Japanese wine. They say that the English phonetic equivalents have no meaning in English. But, they do not say in their pleadings that `Yangmingjiu` when written as `` has no meaning to a literate Chinese. However, in his submissions, counsel for the first plaintiffs continues to maintain that the endorsement is an honestly held view, that is to say, that `` have no meaning to a Japanese. However, they appear to have rendered their position unclear by causing, after the commencement of this action, the UK endorsement to be corrected to substitute the word `Chinese` for the word `Japanese` on the representation that it was a clerical error. I am not sure whether this amendment improves the first plaintiffs` case in these proceedings. What they now appear to say is that `` are Chinese characters with no meaning as they are a transliteration of `Yomeishu` which itself has no meaning. However, there is no evidence that the Singapore endorsement has been corrected so that in Singapore the impression given is that they are Japanese words.
The defendants rely on the opinion of Mr Loo Shaw Chang, the Acting Director of the Chinese Language and Research Centre, National University of Singapore. Mr Loo is of the view that the expression is neither unique nor invented, the first two characters `` (meaning `life nourishing`) having been in use in about 200 BC in 
 A Book of Chinese (Herbal) Medicine 
 by Shen Nong. He also listed six other Chinese books dating from 100 AD up to 1968 in which `` were used. The last character `` meant wine. He however admits that he has not been able to trace the origin of the expression. But he is of the view that the expression should mean, to a Chinese, `the kind of wine that is tonic, nourishing and good for health`.
In the light of Mr Loo`s opinion, counsel for the plaintiffs concedes that there is a serious issue on whether `` have the meaning given by Mr Loo. But, he maintains that the expression is unique and an `invented` expression. In my view, if counsel is unable to refute the opinion of Mr Loo, and he has to accept it for the purpose of this motion, the probability of the first plaintiffs succeeding in establishing that `` are invented words under s 10 of the Act is low, if not remote. The expression might have been `invented` by the first plaintiffs` predecessor in the unusual sense that they were the first person to use it. But that is not the meaning of invention in s 10 of the Act. The expression is no more invented than `shredded wheat`. In the `Solio` case, 
 Eastman Photographic Co`s Application 
 [1898] AC 571at p 581, Lord Herschell said: `I do not think the combination of two English words is an invented word, even although the combination may not have been in use before.` In 
 Philipart v William Whiteley Ltd 
 [1908] 2 Ch 274 at p 279, Parker J said: 
 
To be an invented word within the meaning of the Act a word must not only be newly coined, in the sense of not being already current in the English language, but must be such as not to convey any meaning, or, at any rate an obvious meaning to ordinary Englishmen. It must be a word having no meaning or no obvious meaning until one has been assigned to it.
 
 
 
Uniqueness in the sense of being the only person to use the disputed word does not qualify it as a trade mark if it is descriptive, although uniqueness in the sense of long use may establish a secondary meaning.
That being the law, the first plaintiffs could not have registered `` as a trade mark or part of a trade mark under s 10 of the Act unless they could prove that the characters had a secondary meaning of being distinctive of the medicated wine manufactured exclusively by them. The documentary evidence adduced in these proceedings shows that ` Yomeishu` was accepted for registration in Part A solely on the fact of the UK registration and subject to the same conditions, one of which was that `` were Japanese words which had no meaning. In correcting the error in UK, the first plaintiffs have now admitted that `` were and are not Japanese characters with no meaning but Chinese characters with no meaning to a Japanese. They have adduced no expert evidence to contradict Mr Loo`s opinion that the expression has a descriptive meaning to a Chinese.
In these circumstances, the defendants say that there is a serious issue on fraud to be tried within the 
 American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon 
[1975] AC 396
 guidelines. They say that there was a suppression from the Singapore registrar of material information on how the first plaintiffs obtained registration of the expression in the UK, that the UK registrar believed and was allowed to believe that the expression was a phonetic of `Yomeishu` (which word the registrar was aware had no meaning from its prior registration), and had no meaning. Now, of course, they have corrected their own error in admitting that they are Chinese words. Although this is an interlocutory application, I am minded to say that I have no doubt that if the UK registrar had been told that `` were Chinese characters in origin although used by the Japanese as part of their written language and that they conveyed the meaning claimed by the defendants, he would never have accepted the expression for registration as a mark under Part A of the Register. It may also be said that in accepting the endorsement as one of the conditions for registration in Singapore, the first plaintiffs have similarly allowed the registrar to think that `` were Japanese characters with no meaning. In contrast, Wenping themselves did not appear to think that the words had no meaning as they instructed D & B to register them in Part B of the Register.
The first plaintiffs say there was no fraud in obtaining the UK registration in 1978 as they made no representation to the registrar with respect to the meaning of the expression (not having been asked by Fitzpatricks) other than that it was a transliteration of the word `Yomeishu` which, in Japanese, had no meaning. This is their only substantive defence on the issue of fraud. Their counsel however relied on the procedural objection that fraud was not pleaded in their particulars of objections filed on 18 July 1990. That is so, but although the word `fraud` was not used, the defendants did rely on s 15 of the Act, the ambit of which is not settled. If there were fraud in the registration, it is arguably disentitled to protection under the rubric of `otherwise`: see Lord Diplock in 
 Re GE Trade Mark 
[1973] RPC 297 at p 324. Also, the affidavits filed on behalf of the defendants have expressly alleged fraud in the registration of the registered mark. Moreover, the plaintiffs in their reply and defence to counterclaim have expressly denied that the registrations in both countries were obtained by fraud. In any event, the defendants are relying on fraud as a defence to the application for an interim injunction and not as a ground for expunction under the counterclaim, which has yet to be heard. These are early days yet, and no doubt, the defendants will in due course amend their pleadings. There is no merit in the procedural objection.
`Fraud` is one of those protean concepts in English law. In so far as trade mark legislation is concerned, Roxburgh J had this to say in 
 Bentley Motor (1931) Ltd v Lagonda Ltd 
 (1947) 64 RPC 33 at p 35: 
 
I am most anxious to avoid defining `fraud` in the context in which it appears here, because apparently it has not yet been done, and I am not anxious to be the first to do it if it is not necessary for me to do it; but when I see in conjunction the words `obtained by fraud`, I feel bound to hold that it involves some element of actual deception by the applicant for registration. 
 I want to make it plain that in using the phrase `actual deception` I do not necessarily exclude all omissions, because it is quite possible, and I think it is a trite saying, that a statement may be in such a form that having regard to what is omitted it is deceptive, though on the face of it and taken quite alone it is not deceptive.
 
 
 
But in my judgment a claimant who sets out to say that registration was obtained by fraud must allege some actual deception by word or deed, or some omission by word or deed, of the character which I have just indicated; and accordingly I am not prepared to hear evidence directed to the issue that the registration was obtained by fraud. (Emphasis added.)
 Suppressio veri 
 and 
 suggestio falsi 
 are the two sides of a bad coin. On the evidence, there is undoubtedly a serious issue of fraud to go to trial with respect to the regisof the registered mark, 
 notwithstanding 
 that the applicants` trade mark was deemed distinctive under the proviso to s 10 of the Act which provided as follows: 
 
(1) A trade mark (other than a certification trade mark) registerable in Part A of the register shall contain or consist of at least one of the following essential particulars:
 
 
 
QPARA1>(a) the name of a company, individual or firm represented in a special or particular manner;
(b) the signature of the applicant for the registration or some predecessor in his business; 
(c) an invented word or invented words; 
(d) a word or words having no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods, and not being according to its ordinary signification a geographical name or surname; 
(e) any other distinctive mark; provided that a name, signature, or word or words, other than such as fall within the descriptions in paras (a), (b), (c) and (d), shall not be registrable under this paragraph except upon evidence of its distinctiveness.
 
 
 
 (2) For the purposes of this section, `distinctive` means adapted, in relation to the goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered or proposed to be registered, to distinguish goods with which the proprietor of the trade mark is or may be connected in the course of trade from goods in the case of which no such connection subsists, either generally or, where the trade mark is registered or proposed to be registered subject to limitations, in relation to use within the extent of the registration.
 (3) In determining whether a trade mark is adapted to distinguish as aforesaid the Registrar or the court may have regard to the extent to which - 
(a) the trade mark is inherently adapted to distinguish as aforesaid; and 
(b) by reason of the use of the trade mark or of any other circumstances, the trade mark is in fact adapted to distinguish as aforesaid:
 
 
 
Provided that any mark which has been registered as a distinctive mark in Part A of the register kept in the United Kingdom under the Trade Marks Act 1938 shall be deemed to be a distinctive mark for the purpose of this Act.
 
 
 
If it is contended that s 44 deals with fraud only against the Singapore registrar and not against the United Kingdom registrar and that the Singapore registrations were not fraudulent by reason of the deeming effect of the proviso to s 10, then the further issue arises whether such a statutory provision is applicable to protect or promote in Singapore a fraudulent registration in the United Kingdom. It may be that the provision should be given a purposive interpretation so as not to result in the promotion or protection of fraud: see 
 R 
 v 
 Registrar General, ex p Smith 
 
[1991] 2 QB 393
; [1991] All ER 88 for an illustration of the principle.
 Section 15 of the Act 
The defendants have also raised a defence based on s 15 which provides as follows: 
 
(1) It shall not be lawful to register as a trade mark or part of a trade mark any matter the use of which would, by reason of its being likely to deceive or cause confusion or otherwise, be disentitled to protection in a court of justice, or would be contrary to law or morality, or any scandalous design.
 
 
 
(2) No trade mark shall be registered in respect of particular goods or classes of goods set forth in the Schedule unless the trade mark has been and is registered in the United Kingdom in respect of such goods or classes of goods and unless the application for registration is made by the registered proprietor in the United Kingdom or any person deriving his right from the registered proprietor by assignment, transmission or other operation of law.
 
 
 
Counsel for the defendants contends that the existing registration of `` as part of the registered mark offends s 15 on the ground that, being descriptive words, they are disentitled to protection. This is a difficult argument to sustain in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Imperial Tobacco Co Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 De Pasquali 
 (1918) 35 RPC that s 11 of the 1905 Act (corresponding to s 15) did not apply to a mark which was not entitled to protection because originally not containing one of the essential particulars. In the words of Lord Diplock in 
 Re GE Trade Mark 
 at p 333, `What s 41 (corresponding to s 48 of the Act) did was to preclude removal of a trade mark from the register after seven years upon any ground of invalidity, such as lack of distinctiveness, which would have applied to the original registration.` In view of my finding that there is a serious issue to be tried on fraud, I need not consider this point further.
 Section 45 of the Act 
The defendants also rely on s 45 of the Act which reads: 
 
(1) Subject to this section, and ss 48 and 52, the registration of a person in Part A of the register as proprietor of a trade mark (other than a certification trade mark) in respect of any goods shall, if valid, give or be deemed to have given to that person the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words, that right shall be deemed to be infringed by any person who, not being the proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use, uses a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade, in relation to any goods in respect of which it is registered, and in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken either -
(a) as being use as a trade mark; or 
(b) in a case in which the use is use upon the goods or in physical relation thereto or in an advertising circular or other advertisement issued to the public, as importing a reference to some person having the right either as proprietor or as registered user to use the trade mark or to goods with which such a person as aforesaid is connected in the course of trade.
 
 
 
The defendants say that the words `Chinese Yangming` or ``, when used as a mark, have been adapted to distinguish it from the registered mark. It is contended that the prefix `CK` made it distinguishable from ` Yomeishu`. They also say that `` are used in a descriptive sense, so that it is not likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade in relation to the first plaintiffs` wine. These are questions of fact which can only be established at the trial of the action. Accordingly, there is a serious issue on this defence. The registered mark is not simply `` but ` Yomeishu`, whereas the defendants have been using `Chinese Yangmingjiu` and/or ``. Counsel for the first plaintiffs has indicated from the Bar that the Japanese wine has invariably been advertised and promoted in the form of the registered mark and that neither `Yomeishu` or `` is ever used in isolation but always together. Even if this were not so, an issue of fact arises whether any Chinese-literate consumer in Singapore of the Chinese wine would mistake it for the Japanese wine. No such evidence has been adduced before me.
 Passing-off 
There is an alternative claim in passing-off. On the materials before the court, the motion as based on this cause of action must fail. This again is a question of fact. No evidence has yet been adduced of any consumer having been deceived or confused into thinking that the Chinese wine was or is the product of the first plaintiffs. It is not obvious from a cursory comparison of the respective shapes of the bottles used for the bottling of the Japanese wine and the Chinese wine, the labels thereon and the get up of the boxes in which they are sold to the public that there is sufficiently close similarity in the essential particulars to justify the immediate conclusion of passing off.
 Balance of convenience 
As to the balance of convenience, I start with the consideration of damages as required by the 
 American Cya 
 guidelines. On the evidence, I do not think that the plaintiffs will suffer any loss which cannot be compensated in monetary terms or that the defendants would not be able to pay any such damages that the plaintiffs would be entitled to should they succeed in this action. There is no allegation or any evidence that the Chinese wine is in any way inferior to the first plaintiffs` wine. Accordingly, the question of damage to the reputation and goodwill of the first plaintiffs in the Japanese wine, which might be irreparable, does not arise for consideration.
The sales of the Chinese wine in Singapore for the years 1981-1989 as claimed by the defendants are as follows: 
 
Total yearly sales for Chinese Yangmingjiu
 
 
 
 
(1981) 201 ctns S$25,376.25 
 
(1982) 321 ctns S$41,550.00 
 
(1983) 214 ctns S$28,187.50 
 
(1984) 179 ctns S$25,775.64 
 
(1985) 137 ctns S$18,621.04

(1989) 245 ctns S$33,300.40
  
 
 
Total 1,493 ctns S$199,451.15
 
 
 
In comparison, the sales of the Japanese wine claimed by the plaintiffs are as follows:

(1988) S$2,254,010 S$2,083,151 92% 
(1989) S$2,528,294 S$2,129,242 84%
 
 
 
These figures show that the defendants were and are not seriously in competition with the plaintiffs. As the defendants are small players compared with the plaintiffs in the sale of medicated wine, the grant of an interim injunction will adversely affect the defendants more than if it is not granted.
There is also a countervailing factor against the granting of an interim injunction in this case, and that is the inordinate delay on the part of the first plaintiffs in commencing legal proceedings against the defendants for infringement and passing off. The first plaintiffs were aware as early as 1981 that the defendants were selling the Chinese wine in Singapore. In spite of their earlier threats to institute legal proceedings and the registration of the registered mark in Singapore since 1983, they went to sleep for seven to nine years. They have given a number of reasons for not doing anything from 1981 to 1983, from 1983 to 1986 and from 1989 to 1990. I do not propose to recount these reasons or to comment on their validity except that, in my view, none of them, even if accepted, actually prevented them from taking action if they had wanted to. They were legally entitled to do so, but the curious fact remains that they did not do so until the registered mark became conclusive under s 44 of the Act.
The consequence of the first plaintiffs` inaction was that the defendants were allowed to import, promote by means of advertising and sell the Chinese wine for this long period of time. They have incurred expenditure in building up whatever reputation and/or goodwill they may have in the Chinese wine. Having hibernated for seven to nine years, I am not persuaded that the first plaintiffs` business is suddenly threatened by the defendants` business in the Chinese wine. This is clearly a case where equity will not help him who fails to help himself. The balance of convenience is clearly and preponderantly in favour of the defendants. The status quo ante bellum must remain.
Notwithstanding the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs and the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs with respect to the activities of the Malaysian dealers or manufacturers of the Chinese wine, the alleged conduct of the Chinese exporters of the Chinese wine, their alleged reneging of their promises not to export the Chinese wine to South East Asia and not to use `` to describe such wine, I do not propose to comment on the evidence. Neither the Malaysian manufacturers nor the Chinese exporters (and there is even a dispute on their identities during the period from 1981 to 1990) are parties to this action. Moreover, the present action is not based on the alleged binding agreement with the Chinese exporters, and in any event there is a dispute as to the scope of this agreement, whether the defendants knew of it and if so, whether they are bound by it or if it gives rise to a cause of action against them. The plaintiffs have also alleged that the defendants have not acted bona fide in the way they imported their wine and that they had committed offences under the Customs Act (Cap 70) in the way they described the Chinese wine in their import declarations. All these matters are disputed, and if they are relevant at all in this action, they can only be resolved at the trial.
For the above reasons, the application for an interim injunction is dismissed. Costs will be reserved until the trial of the action.

This is an appeal by the appellant against a sentence passed on him under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`) on his conviction of an offence of driving a car while subject to disqualification.
The facts are that on 10 September 1990 at about 7.40am a car driven by the appellant along Jurong West Street 42 was stopped and checked by the traffic police. On being required to produce his driving licence, the appellant failed to do so. The appellant did not have a driving licence at the time, for reasons that will appear later. Subsequent investigation disclosed that the car belonged to a member of his family. The insurance policy contained the usual condition that it was valid only if the car was driven by a licensed driver.
The appellant was charged under s 43(3) of the Act for driving while under disqualification, and was also charged under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) for driving a car while there was not in force the required policy of insurance in respect of third party risks.
The appellant pleaded guilty to the charges. On the first charge, he was sentenced to one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500, and was also disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of three years. On the second charge, he was sentenced to a fine of $500 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a class 3 driving licence for a period of 12 months. The disqualifications were to run concurrently. The appellant, being dissatisfied with the sentence on the first charge, has appealed to this court. He has paid the fines in respect of both charges and has been granted bail pending his appeal.
Section 43(3) of the Act reads: 
 
If any person who under the provisions of this Act is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence applies for or obtains a driving licence while he is so disqualified or if any such person while he is so disqualified drives a motor vehicle, or if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description a motor vehicle of that class or description, on a road, that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction - 
(a) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months; 
(b) (if the court thinks that having regard to the special circumstances of the case it is not necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the offence) to a fine not exceeding $1,000; or 
(c) to both,
 
 
 
and a driving licence obtained by any person disqualified as aforesaid shall be of no effect.
 
 
 
Section 42 of the Act provides for disqualification for offences as follows: 
 
 
(1) Any court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court thinks fit: 
 
Provided that if the court thinks fit, any disqualification imposed under this section may be limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of the same class or description as the motor vehicle in relation to which the offence was committed. 
 
(2) A person who by virtue of an order of court is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence may appeal against the order in the same manner as against the conviction, and the court may if it thinks fit, pending the appeal, suspend the operation of the order.
  
 
 
The learned magistrate, in his grounds of decision, noted that the appellant admitted to a long list of antecedents. In particular, the appellant had been sentenced to one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $300 for driving while under disqualification as recently as 24 July 1990 and had also been disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of two years. This was less than two months before his present offence. The learned magistrate was of the view that the appellant clearly showed a contempt for court orders, committing the same offence again so soon after he had been disqualified for two years. The learned magistrate took into account counsel`s plea in mitigation that the accused was married with two children aged seven and five years old, was supporting his aged mother, and was presently under probation as a supervisor. He noted that much was made of the fact that the appellant had been suffering since 1987 from diabetes mellitus which required daily medication and that on the day of the offence, the appellant claimed that he was driving to a pharmacy to purchase insulin for his medical condition. However, the three medical reports which had been tendered to substantiate the appellant`s claim of his medical condition had been issued in December 1991 and January 1992, some considetime after the offence had been committed on 10 September 1990. The appellant had made no attempt to show that he was in dire need of insulin on the day of the offence; neither had he shown that he could not have taken a taxi to the pharmacy or had somebody else in his family drive him there.
From a perusal of the appellant`s antecedents, the learned magistrate noted that since 1982 he had been convicted of driving without a valid licence and without insurance on nine previous occasions, and on five of these occasions he had also been driving while under disqualification. Nevertheless, keeping in mind the appellant`s guilty plea, his medical condition and mitigation plea, he sentenced him to only one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500 and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of three years.
The appellant has appealed against the sentence on the ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances. Essentially, his counsel has submitted in this appeal that the learned magistrate failed to give due consideration to his mitigation plea; in particular, that, because of his medical condition, the appellant was, at the time of the offence, under extreme stress and in a state of panic which rendered him incapable of thinking and acting rationally, and resulted in his breaching the order of court. This is very much a rehash of the mitigation plea which was urged on the learned magistrate, and I have no hesitation in rejecting it.
Driving while under disqualification is a serious offence. A person who cannot be trusted with driving a motor vehicle and who yet does so prejudices the safety of other road users. Such an individual must not expect to be treated lightly when he has posed a danger to others by assuming a trust for which he is not fit. Additionally, this leads to a situation in which the motor vehicle is no longer covered by a policy of insurance against third party risks. If the car meets with an accident resulting from the negligence of the driver, the insurance company will not be liable to pay compensation for any damage or injury caused to a third party. Unless special circumstances of the case can be shown within the meaning of the term in s 43(3)(b) of the Act, magistrates should no longer hesitate to impose a substantial sentence of imprisonment. That being so, a sentence of one week`s imprisonment and a fine of $500, together with a disqualification for three years, cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be manifestly excessive. In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, the sentence in this particular case was much too light, and I am surprised that the appellant has not been dissuaded by his solicitors from an unwise appeal.
In this particular case, I note from the list of antecedents in the appeal record that between July 1982 and his present offence on 10 September 1990, the appellant had been convicted on nine separate occasions for driving without a licence and without insurance, and had already been disqualified from driving for varying periods on each of these occasions, in July 1982, July 1983, June 1984, March 1985, August 1985, July 1986, January 1989, February 1990 and July 1990. When he committed the present offence on 10 September 1990, there were three overlapping disqualifications which had not expired, the last of which had been ordered less than two months earlier. In my opinion, this is clearly a case in which, at the hearing of an appeal, the court should exercise its powers under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to enhance the sentence. Accordingly I set aside the previous sentence under s 43(3) and substitute therefor a sentence of imprisonment of six months and a fine of $1,000 or, in default, a further three months. I also order under s 42 of the Act that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life.
The enhancement of sentence which I have ordered this morning is the maximum which is possible under the present law. From his record of offences in the last ten years, it would appear to me that even a disqualification for life is not necessarily going to inhibit a confirmed offender like the appellant from committing the offence again after his release from prison. This is a problem which cannot be resolved by the courts, as the punishment which a court can impose for offences under s 43 of the Act is no longer adequate in the circumstances of today. The problem requires urgent attention by the law-making authorities.

This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the sentence passed on the respondent on his conviction of an offence under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`). The sentence under appeal is a fine of $1,000. The appellant argued that a custodial sentence should have been imposed.
The offence of which the respondent was convicted and sentenced is for driving whilst under disqualification. The charge against him reads: 
 
You, Akhtar Hussain Mann are charged that on 23 March 1989 at about 3pm along Commonwealth Avenue West Singapore, did ride motor cycle No FE 6809Y whilst you were being disqualified by the Magistrate Court No 23 from riding all class 2B, 2A and 2 vehicle for a period of one year wef 18 April 1988 to 17 April 1989 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 43(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
Section 43(3) of the Act reads: 
 
If any person who under the provisions of this Act is disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence applies for or obtains a driving licence while he is so disqualified or if any such person while he is so disqualified drives a motor vehicle, or if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description a motor vehicle of that class or description, on a road, that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction -
 
 
 
(a) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months; 
(b) (if the court thinks that having regard to the special circumstances of the case it is not necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment for the offence) to a fine not exceeding $1,000; or 
(c) to both,
 
 
 
and a driving licence obtained by any person disqualified as aforesaid shall be of no effect.
 
 
 
The magistrate in his grounds of decision explained that: 
 
I did not impose any custodial sentence as I was then of the view that the mitigating circumstances pleaded by the accused amounted to special circumstances under the Act. The prosecution did not address the court on this issue of special circumstances. I took into account the fact that the accused was a first offender and in a month`s time he would be studying in the university. An imprisonment term may affect the accused`s university studies. The accused had also committed the offence towards the end of the disqualification period.
 
 
 
It should be noted that the magistrate was clearly mistaken in describing the respondent as a first offender.
The issues to be determined in this appeal are firstly, what `special circumstances of the case` encompasses and secondly, whether there are any such special circumstances on the facts.
There are no reported decisions from Singapore or Malaysia on the meaning of the phrase. There are decisions on the `special reasons` for not ordering disqualification for the offences of driving under the influence of drink and for driving without insurance cover (see s 67(2) of the Act and s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189)) which must be considered.
Rex v Lim Kian Soo
 
 
[1950] MLJ 181
  is the first reported decision. This was a special case before the High Court of Singapore (Murray-Aynsley CJ, Evans and Storr JJ). The question before the court was the meaning of the words `unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise` in s 48(2) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1941, relating to the offence of driving without insurance cover.
Murray-Aynsley CJ referred to 
Whittall v Kirby
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 a decision on s 15(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1930 bearing the same `special reasons` provisions. In 
Whittall
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 Lord Goddard adopted Andrews LCJ`s definition in 
Rex v Crossan
 
[1939] NI 106
 that: 
 
A `special reason` within the exception is one which is special to the facts of the particular case, that is, special to the facts which constitute the offence. It is, in other words, a mitigating or extenuating circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with the commission of the offence, and one which the court ought properly to take into consideration when imposing punishment. A circumstance peculiar to the offender as distinguished from the offence is not a `special reason` within the exception.
 
 
 
Murray-Aynsley CJ had reservations over this definition. He said: 
 
I personally think that the form in which that statement is made is open to objection. I think that it cuts down the discretion given to the courts when it limits `special circumstances` in this way. Mitigating circumstances in a case may be of either kind.
 
 
 
In my opinion courts, when approaching the question, should begin by remembering that if they find the circumstances sufficient in one case they must make a like finding in all like cases.
The word `special` is the antonym of the word `general` which would mean the circumstances that would be present in every case under the section. But, if they find circumstances `special` for the purpose of mitigation which are found in a large percentage of cases, they are creating exceptions of a general character and it must be assumed that if the legislature had intended that the particular provision should not apply to these common cases it would have said so. Most of the circumstances of a personal character that are usually relied upon are of this kind; eg that the accused had not offended in that way before, that he is a professional driver, etc.
When a discretion of this kind is given it means that certain uncommon cases may occur which could not be foreseen by the legislature in which that particular kind of punishment is unsuitable or manifestly excessive. Such circumstances will usually be found in the circumstances of the offence. It would be perhaps difficult in dealing with this section to think of circumstances of this kind of a personal character, but it will be seen from decided cases that this has happened.
Evans J accepted 
Whittall
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 without reservation, but Storr J expressed his agreement with the Chief Justice. In the event, as far as Singapore is concerned, there appears to be some uncertainty whether `special reasons` extend to circumstances peculiar to an offender. In Malaya (and now in Malaysia), there is no uncertainty. The construction in 
Whittall

 has been accepted in a series of reported decisions, the most recent being 
PP v Teo Kok Keng

Whittall
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
 or that in 
Lim Kian Soo
 
 
[1950] MLJ 181
  I would accept the former. However, I am not so restricted.
The operative words in s 43(3) are `special circumstances 
 of the case 
` (emphasis added). This provision has its counterpart in s 7(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1930, which has received judicial consideration.
In 
Lines v Hersom
 
[1951] 2 KB 682
 Lord Goddard said (at pp 687-688): 
 
In the present case, the words of the section `having regard to the special circumstances of the case`, emphasize that for the purpose of s 7 the circumstances must be special to the case.
 
 
 
I will not say that the conditions relating to the offender are to be left out altogether, because that is almost impossible, but it is the circumstances which are special to the case which are to be the primary consideration.
We also pointed out in 
 Whittall v Kirby 
 
[1947] 1 KB 194
, and I desire to re-emphasize it, that, where Parliament says that the circumstances are to be `special`, it is obviously contrasting circumstances that are special with circumstances that are general.
and that (at pp 688-689): 
 
... the proper interpretation to be put upon s 7, sub-s 4, is that prima facie, for the very serious offence involved, the offender should be sent to prison. The offence of driving when disqualified is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit, because it follows that if he injures someone that person will be unable to recover any compensation if the motorist cannot pay, because no insurance company will be liable. Parliament has said that prison is the proper penalty for the offence. That may be hard, and we have often pointed out that questions of disqualification often involve great hardship, but the question whether there is great hardship or whether the penalty is a severe one is not a matter for the court if Parliament has ordained it. Our duty is to apply the law which Parliament has laid down, and if Parliament has said that prima facie the penalty for this particular offence is to be imprisonment it is the duty of the courts to impose imprisonment unless, as provided in s 7, sub-s 4, there are special circumstances of such a kind as would justify them in passing a lighter sentence, that is to say, a fine instead of imprisonment.
 
 
 
Hilberry J, in concurring with Lord Goddard, was of the view that: 
 
In s 7, sub-s 4, the words are not only `special circumstances` but `special circumstances of the case`, and, in addition, those words occur in a sentence where it is said `or if the court think that, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, a fine would be an adequate punishment for the offence`. I regard the last words of that sentence as being of some importance since they indicate that in s 7, sub-s 4, the statute is not contemplating the offender but essentially the offence, and the special circumstances which the court must find are to be circumstances of the case, disregarding any circumstances which are special to the offender.
 
 
 
In 
Aichroth v Cottee
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1124
[1954] 2 All ER 856
 Lord Goddard went on to say that there is no difference in substance between `special circumstances` and `special reasons` and that the two expressions are the same.
I am in full agreement with the views of the learned judges. Having come to this conclusion, I find that the fact that the respondent was due to go to university is not a special circumstance. In any event, even if this is a matter that can be taken into consideration, the mitigating factors considered by the magistrate do not constitute a sufficient reason not to impose a custodial sentence.
For these reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the fine of $1,000 imposed by the magistrate. As the respondent did not offer any explanation for having ridden his motor cycle whilst he was under disqualification, I sentenced him to serve two weeks` imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of $500.

On 10 August 1990 the appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer death on a charge of murder, being an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). He appealed against the conviction and sentence.
The facts were that on 26 October 1983 a female prostitute was found murdered in her rented room at a boarding flat in Geylang. The autopsy which was performed the next morning found nine injuries on her body. Six of these injuries were triangular stab wounds on her chest, and each of them in itself was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. According to the pathologist who performed the autopsy, these six fatal wounds were all directed at the centre of the body where the vital organs were located. There were too many stab wounds on the body, and they were too deep, ranging between 6cm and 9cm, for them to have been caused accidentally.
At the same time that the body of the deceased was found, the occupant of another rented room in the same boarding flat found that her room had been ransacked. Missing were some $10,000 in money and some $30,000 worth in jewellery, which included one gold-coloured bracelet, one gold-coloured medallion, and another gold-coloured bracelet studded with green and white stones.
No further developments took place for some time. But about five years later, with the assistance of the Malaysian police, the appellant was traced in Alor Setar, Kedah in Malaysia and was arrested and extradited to Singapore. While in custody, he made a statement under s 122(6) and another five statements under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The appellant did not challenge the admissibility, the voluntariness or the accuracy of any of these statements, and they were admitted by the trial judges under s 122(5) as evidence after having been satisfied as to their admissibility. In his statements, the appellant related how in 1982 he had brought a Malaysian girl into Singapore for the purpose of prostitution and had lived on her earnings. Early in 1983 they had gone back together to Malaysia for the Chinese New Year, and had got married there in March 1983. Soon thereafter they had returned to Singapore, where she resumed working as a prostitute, while he continued to live on her earnings, until later in 1983 when they decided to return to Malaysia. Back in Malaysia, however, he soon ran through her accumulated savings. Again in need of money, he remembered that his wife had lent $500 to the deceased early in 1983, while they were in Singapore; he also remembered that, before leaving Singapore, he had asked the deceased to repay the loan, but she had claimed then that she had no money. He thought that if he only frightened her, she would pay up. Armed with a bearing scraper which he bought in Malaysia, he went back to Singapore to look for her.
When he found her in her room in the boarding flat and asked for repayment of the loan, she again claimed that she was unable to repay the money because she was out of work, and thus had no money. He threatened her by pointing the bearing scraper at her neck, but she brushed the bearing scraper aside. It fell to the floor, and the appellant claimed that they both fought for it. He managed to get it, and stabbed her a number of times with it. Before he fled the scene, he noticed that the door of the next room was open, so he went in, broke open the drawer of the wardrobe and stole the cash and items of jewellery which have been described earlier. He went back to Malaysia and spent the money, and, when the money was exhausted, he sold or pawned the jewellery.
The relevant part of one of the appellant`s s 121 statements read as follows: 
 
 
(17) ... I took a taxi and proceeded to Lorong 29 Geylang ... I saw [the deceased] at the hall. She also saw me outside the gate. I called her name and asked her to unlock the gate for me to go in as I have something to talk to her. She obliged and unlocked the iron grille gate with her set of keys. I could not recall where she took her keys from. At the hall, I asked her for the $500. `Sow Cheng` replied that she had no money as she had been out of work.While replying to me, she moved towards her room. She entered her room and I followed in. This was the room which my wife and I previously occupied when we were in Singapore. I chided her for breaking her promise and that I was also in dire need of money. She kept on saying that she had no money and out of work. I then whipped out the bearing scraper which I kept in my sock and threatened her with it. I also pointed the bearing scraper somewhere in her neck region. At that moment, I did not have any intention to harm her. I merely wanted to frighten her to submit hoping that I could collect the $500. `Sow Cheng` on seeing my weapon appeared more aggressive and swipe my right hand away with her left. On impact, the bearing scraper dropped from my right hand and landed on the floor. `Sow Cheng` and I went for the bearing scraper and there was a struggle between us. I managed to grab hold of the bearing scraper and in the process, I saw blood on my right palm. I also felt pain. `Sow Cheng` and I went down on the floor and she was still trying to grab my hand. At that juncture, I lost my head and just kept on stabbing `Sow Cheng` with the bearing scraper. I could not know how many times did I plunge the bearing scraper into her body. I am also unable to say whether or not did she uttered any sound at that moment. After a brief moment, I stopped and I then realized that `Sow Cheng` was motionless and blood on her body. I also saw blood on my hands. At that moment I also did not know whether `Sow Cheng` was dead or alive. I then went to the kitchen area and washed the blood away on my hands.
  
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that there was no case to answer as he did not have an intention to kill the deceased; but the learned trial judges found that the prosecution had made out a case on the charge for the appellant to answer, and therefore called on him to enter on his defence. The appellant elected to remain silent and declined to call any witness for his defence. His counsel also declined to make a further submission. The court`s consideration of the matter was set out on p 22 of the grounds of decision which read as follows: 
 
From the accused`s confession, which we found to be true, it is clear to us that he had come all the way from Malaysia to Singapore armed with a bearing scraper in order to collect the $500 debt the deceased owed him. He looked up the deceased and inflicted all these fatal stab wounds when she failed to pay up. From the weapon used and the location of these fatal stab wounds, we have no doubt whatsoever that the accused, when he stabbed the deceased, had intended to inflict the kind of bodily injuries on the deceased which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. 
 We have also found that there was no provocation coming from the deceased to the accused and the accused was not entitled to the benefit of Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code
. We again considered the prosecution evidence and we were satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt. We therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him.
 
 
 
The passage emphasized is referred to later in our judgment.
Before this court, Mr Palakrishnan, counsel for the appellant, contended that the written grounds of judgment were almost entirely confined to extensive quotations from the six statements by the appellant, and the remainder of the grounds did not show that the defence had been completely considered, much less the reasons for its rejection. There was no reasoned judgment on the facts and the law which was necessary to show that the court had got to the bottom of the case. He referred the court to 
Sultan Mohamed v R
 
 
[1952] MLJ 186
  ; 
Balasingham v PP
 
 
[1959] MLJ 193
  ; and 
Vijayaratnam v PP
 
 
[1962] MLJ 106
 
In particular, he contended that the statements which constituted the main evidence against the appellant were in fact mixed statements, containing both inculpatory and exculpatory passages, and the trial judges wrongly treated them as wholly inculpatory and as true. This totally ignored the principles laid down so recently by this court in 
Chan Kim Choi v PP
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  which referred to the decisions by the English Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in 
R v Storey and Anwar
 
[1968] 52 Cr App R 334
 and by the Privy Council in 
R v Leong Kam-kwok
 
[1985] 81 Cr App R 83
 The trial judges should have considered both the inculpatory parts which were likely to be true, and the exculpatory parts which were the evidence of the facts stated, and this was of particular importance in a case such as this where the accused elected, as he was entitled, to remain silent. By their misdirecting themselves the trial judges held the confessions to be true and dismissed any argument by the defence of provocation based on Exception 1 to s 300 of the Code. We disagreed with this argument. As correctly pointed out, 
 Chan Kim Choi 
`s case4 lays down the test. It was clear to us that the learned judges did not err. In fact, they had considered the entire statement and expressly rejected the defence of provocation as seen from the extract above.
Another argument raised by counsel for the appellant was that the trial judges had a duty to consider all the exceptions to s 300 of the Code even though the defence had not raised any of them. The failure or omission of the trial judges to do so was fatal. He referred us to 
Mat Sawi bin Bahodin v PP

[1986] 1 MLJ 474
  and 
Ramlan bin Salleh v PP
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 709
  Counsel contended that in particular the trial judges had failed to consider Exceptions 2 and 4 having regard to what the appellant had said in his s 121 statements. We disagreed with this contention. In our view, the authorities cited by counsel did not support such a wide proposition. In each of the said decisions, there was some evidence on one or more of these defences which was fit to be referred to the jury or the assessors for their finding but which the judge had withheld from them. The correct position is set out in the following passage from the judgment of the Privy Council (delivered by Lord Scarman) in 
Mohamed Kunjo v PP
 
 
[1978] 1 MLJ 51
  at p 53: 
 
The exception was not relied upon by the defence either at trial or before the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is not mentioned in the judgments of the High Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal. Can it now be raised for the first time?
 
 
 
Where trial has been by jury and the burden of proof is upon the prosecution to negative the defence, it is settled law that the judge must put to the jury all matters which upon the evidence could entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict than murder. And, if the judge fails to do so, the Board will intervene, even if the matter was not raised below. For otherwise there would be the risk of a failure of justice. In 
 Kwaku Mensah v The King 
[1946] AC 83
, Lord Goddard, giving the reasons of the Board for allowing the appeal, said, at p 94: 
 
`The principles on which this Board acts in criminal cases are well known and need no repetition, but when there has been an omission to place before the jury for their consideration a matter of such grave importance that they were never led to consider whether in this respect the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving murder as distinct from manslaughter, their Lordships think that they can properly entertain the appeal. They would add that it must be seldom that they consider a matter which was not only not mentioned in the courts below, but was not included in the reasons given by the appellant in his case.`
 
 
 
Although different considerations arise where, as here, the burden of proving the defence or exception is upon the defendant and trial is by judge (or judges) alone, Mr French for the public prosecutor has not contended either that s 105 of the Evidence Act, or the mere fact of trial being by judge alone, precludes the Board from considering a defence not raised below. But he does raise the point that it does not follow from a judge`s silence as to a possible defence that he has ignored it. He may have thought the matter too plain for argument - more especially, if it has not been raised by the defence. Moreover it would not, in our judgment, assist the administration of criminal justice if there were to be cast upon the High Court the duty of reciting in judgment only to reject every defence that might have been raised but was not. Nevertheless there will be cases in which justice requires the Board to consider matters not mentioned in the court below.
 
 
 
Exception 2 refers to the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence and where the accused uses excessive power in the exercise of such right but without any premeditation and without doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. In our view, this defence was incompatible with the express finding of the trial judges that the appellant had inflicted the fatal wounds when she failed to pay up her debt of $500. In making this finding, the trial judges had disbelieved the appellant`s statement in his confession that the deceased and the appellant `went for the bearing scraper and there was a struggle between [them]`. The trial judges were entitled to reject this part of the confession of the appellant: see 
Chan Kim Choi
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 260
  Furthermore, the evidence of the pathologist who conducted the autopsy clearly showed Exception 2 could have no application. There were six triangular stab wounds on the deceased`s chest, and the pathologist`s evidence was that any of the six in itself would have been sufficient to cause the death of the deceased in the ordinary course of nature. The inapplicability of this defence was too plain for argument. Exception 4 refers to killing a person without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. For the same reasons given earlier in this paragraph, this defence was also not available to the appellant. The s 121 statements did not disclose a sudden fight. There was no point in the trial judges reciting this exception in their judgment only for the purpose of rejecting it.
Counsel for the appellant made one further submission that the trial judges erred in law in admitting the appellant`s statements in their entirety without considering that there was prejudicial evidence in the statements which suggested that the appellant may be guilty of other offences and/or was of bad character. He relied on 
Makin v A-G for New South Wales
 
[1894] 57 AC 
 He said that no evidence was given that the appellant had a good character, and, therefore, several parts of the appellant`s statement ought not to have been admitted as they showed bad character. He submitted that the evidence might have influenced the trial judges. He further submitted that if the evidence had no probative value, it was inadmissible.
We did not agree with this submission. Although the trial judges have reproduced the whole of the s 121 statements in their grounds of decision, and the statements showed that the appellant was, prior to the killing, a pimp and had lived on the immoral earnings of his girlfriend, there was no basis to suggest that the trial judges had been adversely influenced in any way by these statements concerning the character of the appellant. They had merely accepted the appellant`s confession as to his motive for coming to Singapore and his stabbing of the deceased, but without accepting his exculpatory statements. In a criminal trial without a jury, as in all such trials in Singapore, the wrongful admission of evidence of the bad character or disposition of the accused does not necessarily mean that the judge or judges have been adversely influenced by such evidence. We must bear in mind that judges are trained to assess evidence objectively and to sift the wheat from the chaff. It is, of course, true to say that the admission of past conviction of the accused or of his bad disposition or reputation 
 may 
 influence the minds of the judges. But, this is very far from saying that there was a probability that it has influenced them or indeed that it has influenced them in a particular case. Section 396 of the CPC makes it clear that no finding of the trial court shall be reversed unless the wrongful admission of evidence has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. In this case, we did not think that there was any miscarriage of justice by the admission of the entire s 121 statements.
Having said that, we should also like to say that prosecutors should exercise more care in admitting statements under s 122(5). Here, the entire s 121 statements containing 17 paragraphs were tendered in evidence when all that the deputy public prosecutor desired was to admit that portion which contained the confession of the appellant that he had stabbed the deceased in the circumstances mentioned therein. The confession was contained in the last paragraph of the statements ie para 17, the bulk of which we have quoted earlier. The other 16 preceding paragraphs of the statements were concerned with the past activities of the appellant and had nothing whatever to do with the offence for which he was charged. Section 122(5) is not a carte blanche to introduce irrelevant and/or prejudicial statements made by the accused which would otherwise not have been admissible under the provisions of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) or the CPC. We expect prosecutors to exercise more care in future in complying with the rules of the procedure and evidence in this particular respect.
In the result, we were satisfied that on the evidence the trial judges were fully justified in convicting the appellant of murder. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal.

Whether sentence manifestly excessive
 
On 20 November 1992 the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal trespass and was convicted. She was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment and appealed against this sentence as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to four weeks` imprisonment. I now give my reasons for doing so.
The charge to which the appellant pleaded guilty read as follows: 
 
You, Leong Shiaw Ling ... are charged that you on or about 23 October 1992, at about 1am, at the 33rd level of Westin Stamford Hotel, Stamford Road, Singapore, committed criminal trespass by entering into the compound of aforesaid hotel in the possession of one, Gunajekaran s/o SN Sinniah, with intent to cause annoyance to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Before this court, counsel argued that the trial judge was wrong in convicting the accused on the charge because her intention to annoy when entering the hotel at the relevant time was not addressed in the statement of facts.
The first observation that may be made is that s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides: 
 
When an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.
 
 
 
These words are plain and should not be circumvented. Counsel asked in his skeletal arguments in support of the appeal against sentence that the court`s revisionary powers be exercised, but no petition for revision was filed nor do there appear to be any reasons, let alone good and sufficient ones, why it was not. In this particular instance no prejudice appears to have been occasioned by this procedure so counsel was permitted to address the court on this submission, but some adverse criticism of this method as a habitual manoeuvre is merited.
In any event counsel`s argument did not succeed. In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 1 a person who entered the Bukit Turf Club in blatant disregard of a prohibition notice was held by this court to have entered with intent to annoy the management of the club. In was held that it would be wrong and unrealistic to insist on further evidence of such intention before a conviction could be founded; the requisite intent might be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and need not have been the primary or proximate intent of the accused.
Counsel sought to distinguish 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 1 on the grounds that the accused in that case had not pleaded guilty but had elected to remain silent at trial, arguing at the end of it that there was no direct evidence as to the intention with which he entered the club`s premises. The utility of this particular distinction to the appellant in the present case is not immediately apparent. Indeed her plea of guilt was an admission as to all elements of the offence charged, including the mental element. As such, on counsel`s argument, she had in fact a weaker case than the respondent in 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 .1 Counsel did not put forward any other arguments to distinguish that case. I therefore turn to consider the facts of the case and the matters stated in mitigation of the appellant`s sentence.
The appellant was at the material time a masseuse. On 10 October 1992 she was served with a persona-non-grata notice by the Westin Stamford Hotel in respect of her soliciting hotel guests as clients for her services. Apparently she had already been prosecuted previously for this particular activity and on 12 October 1992 was fined $500 for it.
The complainant, Gunajekaran s/o SN Sinniah, is a security supervisor at the Westin Stamford Hotel. On 23 October 1992 at about 12.40am the security controller told him that a hotel guest in a room on the 33rd level had complained about being solicited by a masseuse, and instructed him to watch for her. Accordingly he went to the 33rd level and at about 1am observed the appellant walking towards the room of the hotel guest who had made the complaint. The complainant identified himself and questioned the appellant, who said she was looking for the hotel guest in that room. She was then brought to the security office in the hotel.
The trial judge decided that the repetition of her solicitations so soon after the first incident merited a short custodial sentence of two weeks since the $500 fine in respect of the first incident, which was the maximum, appeared to have had no deterrent effect upon her.
I have considered the matters stated by counsel in mitigation. It is appreciated that the appellant has had a personal history of much hardship and unhappiness. Nevertheless counsel had not put before the court any matter which would justify a finding that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive in the circumstances. In fact, her criminal record is not confined to the previous incident of criminal trespass when she was fined $500. In May of the same year, 1992, she had been convicted of two offences of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, contrary to s 332 of the Penal Code. She was fined $1,500 for each of these offences. She continued to enter the same hotel when she had been served with a notice not to do so, and entered precisely to conduct the very activities in respect of which that notice was served and which she had been prosecuted for already in the recent past. In the circumstances I was of the view that a degree of severity beyond that adopted by the district court was condign. Accordingly I dismissed the appeal and enhanced the appellant`s sentence to four weeks` imprisonment.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff is a widow who contends that her home has been wrongly mortgaged, her signature to the mortgage having been obtained by fraud. She now claims: 
 
 
(a) as against the mortgagee (the second defendant), an order that (i) the mortgage be declared fraudulent and void, (ii) it be set aside and (iii) the title deeds to her home be returned to her; 
 
(b) as against the company whose liabilities the mortgage was intended to secure (the first defendant), an order for damages; 
 
(c) as against the firm of solicitors (the third defendants) whose employed solicitor is alleged to have falsely witnessed her signature in the mortgage and attested her acknowledgment of execution, an order for damages.
  
 
 
There are also third and fourth party proceedings between the various defendants. The second defendant claims an indemnity or damages (or both) from the other two defendants as well as from the solicitor personally. The third defendants, in their capacity as second third party, likewise claim an indemnity or damages (or both) from the solicitor (now no longer employed by them) as fourth party.
The first defendant has not entered appearance, and a default interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiff for damages to be assessed has been entered against it. The trial has therefore proceeded with only the second and third defendants and the fourth party present.
I begin with an examination of the facts.
 The evidence of the plaintiff
The plaintiff`s evidence (given in Cantonese) was this. She was born in 1919. She came to Singapore from China when she was about 11 years old, not having learnt any English there. She had received ten years of education in the Chinese stream in Singapore. At school, she learnt English two or three times a week, but she claimed that her English was poor. After completing her secondary education at the age of 19, she became a primary school teacher and carried on teaching until her retirement in about 1974.
She had a husband, Hoh Sou Yen, and three children: 
 
 
(a) Hoh May Yin (born around 1952), 
 
(b) Hoh Weng Cheong (born around 1953), and 
 
(c) Hoh Weng Yip (born around 1964).
  
 
 
The property in question, No 64 Lorong 24A, Geylang (which I will call `the property`), is their family home, and was purchased in 1957 in the name of the plaintiff. In 1973, the plaintiff conveyed the property to Hoh Weng Cheong and Hoh Weng Yip by way of gift. Later, Hoh Weng Cheong married and wished to purchase an HDB apartment. It was therefore necessary for him to divest himself of his interest in the property, and Hoh Weng Cheong and Hoh Weng Yip then conveyed the property to the plaintiff and her husband in 1978, again by way of gift.
In early 1984, the plaintiff`s husband became very ill, and in February he was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where he remained until he died on the night of 27 June 1984. Prior to his death, the title deeds to the property were kept in a safe deposit box in the joint names of the plaintiff and her husband. Around June 1984, the plaintiff took out everything in the safe deposit box, as she knew of a friend who had encountered difficulties in removing her belongings from her safe deposit box after her husband`s death. A few days after she brought the items home, the plaintiff handed the title deeds to Hoh Weng Cheong and asked him to photocopy them as a precaution. Thereafter, she forgot about the deeds until the events of November 1986, which I will describe later.
On 28 June 1984, the day after his father`s death, Ho Weng Cheong approached the plaintiff in her kitchen with two sheets of paper written in English, which he asked her to sign. Ho Weng Cheong told her that he was in business and that he wanted others to know that he was a man of good character. She was therefore under the impression that what she was signing was a form of testimonial as to her son`s character to help him in his business. She did not understand the documents as they were in English, and she signed her name in Chinese on the two sheets of paper. (The two pages signed by her are reproduced at the end of this judgment.) No one else was present at this meeting.
Contrary to her belief, the two sheets were in fact the last two pages of a mortgage of the property. The mortgage was purportedly made between the plaintiff and her husband of the first part, the first defendant (which I will call `Sourgrapes`) of the second part and the second defendant (which I will call `OCBC`) of the third part. Under the mortgage (which the plaintiff did not see until much later), the plaintiff and her husband jointly and severally guaranteed the credit facilities to be granted by OCBC to Sourgrapes, and the property was mortgaged to OCBC as security for the guarantors` obligations. Sourgrapes was controlled by Lee Boon Seng, the brother-in-law of Hoh Weng Cheong. (Hoh Weng Cheong was apparently working in Sourgrapes at this time and became a director shortly after the execution of the mortgage, although the plaintiff claimed that she did not know this at the time, or even that her son was involved in Sourgrapes.) Unknown to the plaintiff, Lee Boon Seng had negotiated with OCBC for a line of credit to be granted to Sourgrapes on the security (among other things) of a mortgage of the property, and Hoh Weng Cheong had been asked to secure the signatures of his parents to the engrossed mortgage. The two places where the plaintiff was asked to sign were in fact (i) the execution clause of the mortgage and (ii) the attestation certificate prescribed for mortgages requiring registration in the Registry of Deeds.
Also unknown to the plaintiff at the time, Hoh Weng Cheong, after obtaining her signature to the mortgage, forged his father`s signature. His parents` purported signatures were then witnessed by the fourth party (whom I will call `the legal assistant`), who also signed the attestation certificate. The legal assistant, who had been retained by Hoh Weng Cheong to act for Sourgrapes in the transaction, then forwarded the mortgage to Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co, solicitors for OCBC, who advised their clients to release the banking facilities to Sourgrapes. The facilities were also guaranteed by Hoh Weng Cheong and Lee Boon Seng. The plaintiff remained ignorant of all these matters until the events next described.
Sometime around 12 November 1986, the Registrar of Titles wrote to Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co to advise them that the property was being brought under the provisions of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157). A copy of this letter was extended to the plaintiff and her husband as owners of the property. When the letter arrived, Hoh May Yin was at home and opened the letter. When she read its contents, she realized that the property had been mortgaged to OCBC, and informed the plaintiff of this. The plaintiff then summoned Hoh Weng Cheong, who was not staying with them. He admitted that he had mortgaged the property to OCBC, and said that they had lost the house because his business (presumably referring to the business of Sourgrapes) had failed.
A few days later, the plaintiff went to the Jurong branch of OCBC (which was the branch in charge of Sourgrapes` account) and met the branch manager, Pang Tee Hiak. After obtaining his confirmation that the property had been mortgaged to OCBC, the plaintiff queried how her husband`s name could have appeared in the mortgage as he had already passed away. She also told him that she had not knowingly signed the mortgage. Pang Tee Hiak advised her that, since the mortgage had been signed by both mortgagors, OCBC had advanced the credit facilities to Sourgrapes. He also informed her that the amount owing on this account was about $224,000.
She then returned home, and summoned Hoh Weng Cheong again to ask him who had signed her husband`s name. He admitted that he had forged his father`s signature. He also told her that the legal assistant had `effected` the mortgage for him (which presumably meant that the legal assistant had acted in the mortgage transaction for Sourgrapes).
Some days later, the plaintiff returned to the Jurong branch of OCBC, and told Pang Tee Hiak that she wanted to sell her house to settle the amount owing from Sourgrapes. He said that he would have to check on this with his superiors. Later, he called her to say that this could be done. Since she had been told that the amount owing on the account was about $224,000, she wanted to sell the house for about $320,000 so as to have enough left over to buy an HDB flat. However, the highest offer she received was only $240,000, and so she did not carry out her plan to sell the property.
In December 1986, she summoned Hoh Weng Cheong, the legal assistant and Lee Boon Seng for a meeting to try and resolve the matter by getting these three persons to pay her compensation of $60,000 each. The meeting was held at the coffee house of the Hotel Grand Central, but nothing could be discussed because Lee Boon Seng failed to attend the meeting. Another attempt was made at a meeting a few days later at her house, but again Lee Boon Seng did not attend.
As no progress was being made towards a settlement of the problem, the plaintiff then decided to take legal advice. She went to see a lady lawyer, who obtained a copy of the mortgage, and for the first time the plaintiff saw her own signature and the forged signature of her husband. She then changed lawyers, and briefed her present counsel. On 21 January 1987, she lodged a police report against Hoh Weng Cheong at the Commercial Crimes Division. This led to charges being preferred against Hoh Weng Cheong and Lee Boon Seng for cheating OCBC. Hoh Weng Cheong eventually pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to a term of 18 months` imprisonment on 13 July 1987. Lee Boon Seng claimed trial and, at his trial on 2 May 1989, Hoh Weng Cheong gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. However, his credit was impeached and, as a result, Lee Boon Seng was acquitted and discharged.
On 8 April 1987, the plaintiff`s solicitors wrote for the first time to OCBC to dispute the validity of the mortgage on the grounds that she had not knowingly signed the mortgage and the writ in this action was eventually issued in November 1987.
In the course of her cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that she had made a loan of $30,000 in 1985. At the request of counsel for OCBC, the loan documents were produced by the plaintiff. They showed that she had made a loan of $30,000 to Sourgrapes at 4% interest per annum, the loan being guaranteed by Lee Boon Seng. The plaintiff, however, claimed that she had always believed that the loan was a personal loan to Hoh Weng Cheong to help him in his business, and that the guarantor was the legal assistant.
 The evidence of Hoh May Yin
Hoh May Yin gave evidence in support of those parts of the plaintiff`s evidence to which she had been a witness. She was English-speaking, and worked as a secretary. She had stayed in the family home until her marriage in March 1987. She confirmed the plaintiff`s account of how she had discovered in November 1986 that the property was mortgaged. She also accompanied the plaintiff on her second visit to OCBC, and corroborated her mother`s offer to sell the house. She was also present at the two meetings between her mother and Hoh Weng Cheong in 1986. She had assisted in trying to sell the house, and confirmed that the highest offer received was $240,000. She was also present at the two meetings with the legal assistant and Hoh Weng Cheong which Lee Boon Seng failed to attend.
In her cross-examination, Hoh May Yin became confused when she was asked about the $30,000 loan. She appeared familiar with the matter when it was first raised, but later claimed that she had no knowledge of it until it was mentioned in court. The next day, she said that she had heard about the loan when the plaintiff`s present lawyers were being briefed.
There was a slight conflict between her evidence and that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had given evidence that Hoh Weng Cheong hardly ever came home after he got married in 1978. Hoh May Yin, however, said that he came home fairly regularly (about once a month) and, when their father was ill, he came home very frequently, and continued to visit the home fairly often even after their father`s death.
One question that arose in the course of cross-examination of both the plaintiff and Hoh May Yin was how the property came to be valued on two occasions by valuers of OCBC, who had obviously gained access to the property for the purpose of such valuations. Both the plaintiff and Hoh May Yin denied any knowledge of these valuations, but said that Hoh Weng Cheong had his own keys to the house, and sometimes brought his friends back to the house when neither of them was at home.
 The evidence of Hoh Weng Yip
Hoh Weng Yip was called by the plaintiff only to explain why he had signed a joint statutory declaration with Hoh Weng Cheong, declaring that they were solvent in 1978, when the property was conveyed by them by way of gift to their parents. The statutory declaration was required by Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co as part of the mortgage documentation (presumably to satisfy themselves that the provisions of s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) were not applicable). It was declared before a Commissioner for Oaths on 29 June 1984, two days after their father`s death, and one day after the plaintiff had signed the mortgage.
Hoh Weng Yip claimed to know nothing about the mortgage, and his explanation for signing the statutory declaration was that Hoh Weng Cheong had asked him to sign it, which he had done without understanding what it had meant. According to him, Hoh Weng Cheong had told him that the effect of the document was that it would transfer the ownership of the property back to the plaintiff.
Hoh Weng Yip had completed his secondary three education in a technical school, and then studied in VITB for two years before commencing work. He was trained as a machinist, but had never worked as such; his last job was as a packer, but he was currently unemployed. He had received his education in English, and could read and write English. However, he gave his evidence in Cantonese.
This witness`s evidence was quite hopeless, as he was either unable or unwilling to answer most of the questions put to him in cross-examination. I will comment on the effect of this later.
 The defence of OCBC
OCBC only called one witness, Pang Tee Hiak. Although his account of the conversations he had with the plaintiff differed slightly from hers, I did not find any significance in the discrepancies. A contemporaneous minute he made on the day of their first meeting supports the plaintiff`s version in most material respects. The defence of OCBC was that the plaintiff knew what she was signing on 28 May 1984. This was supported by the fact that she had agreed to loan Sourgrapes $30,000 in 1985, which showed that she was willing to help Hoh Weng Cheong in his business. This defence was taken to its logical conclusion by counsel for the third defendants, who (without adducing any evidence) suggested that the plaintiff had willingly executed the mortgage to assist Hoh Weng Cheong`s business and (by implication) had stood by while he forged his late father`s signature. Counsel went on to suggest that subsequently, when Hoh Weng Cheong`s business failed, the whole Hoh family had conspired to make up the story that the plaintiff had been tricked into signing the mortgage so as to save the property from foreclosure or a mortgagee sale. I will deal later with the third defendants` defence on the issue of the negligence of the legal assistant.
 Analysis of the evidence
The plaintiff`s evidence was highly unsatisfactory in many respects. The following are but a few examples. 
 
 
(a) She said that she thought the loan of $30,000 was to her son personally, and that the loan would be guaranteed by a lawyer. Upon further cross-examination, she said that she thought the lawyer who would give the guarantee was the legal assistant, even though, on her own evidence, she did not know the legal assistant until after November 1986. Furthermore, she never satisfactorily explained why she wanted a guarantor for a loan to her son (whom she claims she trusted). 
 
(b) She also denied that she ever considered charging her son interest for the loan, yet the loan documents clearly showed that interest was chargeable at 4%pa. 
 
(c) Although she said that she had agreed to make the loan to her son instead of to Sourgrapes, no explanation was proffered as to why the loan documents were in the name of Sourgrapes. 
 
(d) She did not satisfactorily explain why she had made no claim against any party for the recovery of the $30,000 loan, when (on her own evidence) she could have sued Hoh Weng Cheong or the legal assistant. On her own admission, she never even mentioned the loan to the legal assistant on the two occasions she met him, apparently because she did not wish to raise the loan issue until the mortgage issue was settled. 
 
(e) One would have thought that, when the loan was not repaid, even if she had believed that Hoh Weng Cheong had no money to pay her, she would have looked at the guarantee in her possession. If she had done so, she would immediately have discovered that the loan was in fact to Sourgrapes and the guarantor was in fact Lee Boon Seng. 
 
(f) She also gave no satisfactory explanation for the fact that she had not sued Hoh Weng Cheong or Lee Boon Seng for fraudulently inducing her to sign this mortgage when, on her own evidence, these two were the principal culprits for her predicament. (I was informed from the Bar, however, that Lee Boon Seng had been made bankrupt.) 
 
(g) She said that Hoh Weng Cheong had moved out of the house in 1978, and hardly ever came back to visit. However, when asked how it was possible for valuers from OCBC to visit and inspect the house for purposes of producing valuation reports (of which she claimed she had no knowledge), she said that Hoh Weng Cheong had keys to the house, and sometimes used to bring his friends back to the house when she was not in. She did not explain how this was likely at a time when Hoh Weng Cheong had stopped visiting the family, and presumably would have had no opportunity to tell her of any visits made when she was not in. 
 
(h) Hoh Weng Cheong`s lack of visits would also imply a lack of closeness to his mother during the period preceding his father`s death, and yet she was prepared to sign a testimonial for him unquestioningly even though, on her own evidence, she had no real idea of what he had been doing recently. 
 
(i) Although she discovered the fraud in November 1986, she took no steps to write to OCBC to disclaim liability under the mortgage until April 1987, even though she had taken legal advice in January. 
 
(j) It was a strange coincidence that she should have handed the title deeds to Hoh Weng Cheong at about the time he needed to give them to OCBC`s solicitors. Furthermore, there was no clear explanation as to how he was able to obtain the insurance policy and property tax receipts as well. (All these documents had been requested by Messrs Wee Swee Teow & Co and furnished by Hoh Weng Cheong.) Nonetheless, I was inclined to accept her explanation that she had handed the deeds to him for photocopying, and had forgotten to get them back from him.
  
 
 
The evidence of Hoh May Yin was also unsatisfactory with regard to the loan, and Hoh Weng Yip`s evidence could effectively be discounted completely in view of his performance in the witness box. Indeed, it was suggested that he knew of the mortgage when he signed the statutory declaration, and, if he knew, he would not have done anything to facilitate it unless he had first obtained the plaintiff`s approval; hence, the plaintiff must have known of the mortgage. However, I am more inclined to believe that he was duped by Hoh Weng Cheong into signing the statutory declaration, and was now too ashamed of his part in this disaster to assist the court. At the end of the day, there was no other evidence in support of the conspiracy theory, and I cannot find that the defendants have discharged the heavy onus of proof required to sustain an allegation of fraud, which was not even pleaded.
Nevertheless, despite the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff, I find in favour of the plaintiff on the essential question of fact, namely, whether she signed the mortgage knowing the legal nature of the document. In my judgment, she did not know that what she signed was a mortgage or any document relating to the property. I make this finding for the following reasons. 
 
 
(1) I give allowance for the fact that she is not a person conversant in business affairs, and was unused to giving evidence in court, particularly undergoing cross-examination by several counsel in an unfamiliar language. 
 
(2) While she was often incoherent and illogical in her answers, she is now 73, and often had difficulty in understanding some of the questions and expressing herself clearly. I do not think that she gave her evidence with the intention of misleading the court. For example, she said, in answer to a question from me, that she had put on her glasses before signing the documents, although she could easily have said that she did not do so in order to strengthen her case. 
 
(3) Although the hypothesis of conspiracy suggested by the defence is plausible, it remains purely speculative, without any tangible evidence to support it so as to destroy the credibility of the plaintiff`s case. The only weapon in the armoury of the defence was to try and find inconsistencies in the evidence of the plaintiff or her witnesses. Although there were certainly such inconsistencies, I am afraid they are not enough for me to reject the plaintiff`s case outright in favour of the conspiracy theory, which I must adopt if I am to reject the plaintiff`s account of the facts. 
 
(4) Cross-examination of the plaintiff disclosed that she had previously signed conveyancing documents in English. The mortgage, however, was signed in Chinese. If the plaintiff had intended voluntarily to execute the mortgage, I think it more likely that she would have signed in English (as in the previous two documents) than in Chinese. I recognize, however, that this is a marginal point. 
 
(5) Although she was vigorously attacked in cross-examination on the $30,000 loan, she made no attempt to conceal the loan, and in fact volunteered the information (albeit in cross-examination). She also produced the loan documents when she could well have said that they had been lost. Again, I do not find her attitude in relation to the loan (however confused) consistent with that of a conspirator. 
 
(6) There was no suggestion that, at the time of signing the documents, she was attempting to cheat OCBC, or that she knew that Hoh Weng Cheong had forged her husband`s signature. If she had knowingly signed the mortgage to help Hoh Weng Cheong, she must have queried him whether her signature alone would have been valid, since her husband had just died, and I cannot believe that she would have been familiar with the niceties of land law (which I will explain later) that made her sole signature sufficient for the validity of the mortgage. 
 
(7) The factor, however, that weighs most heavily with me is this. To adopt the conspiracy theory is to postulate that the plaintiff, in order to buttress her fraud argument so as to set aside the mortgage, deliberately made a police report against her own son. Since she did this after having taken legal advice, she must have known full well that this was likely to lead to her son serving a term of imprisonment, which he in fact did. Her unchallenged evidence was that during his incarceration she did not visit him, and that she did not see him after his release from prison except to bring him to her counsel`s office to accept service of a subpoena. Although Hoh Weng Cheong was subpoenaed, he did not appear and, despite OCBC`s counsel`s submission that I should draw an adverse inference from his non-appearance, I decline to do so. It would require a mother to possess qualities worthy of Medea or Tz`u Hsi deliberately and cold-bloodedly to send her own son to jail in order to save her home. I do not think that the plaintiff is such a person. Indeed, the undisputed evidence is that, when she first knew of the mortgage and raised the question of the signatures to the mortgage with Pang Tee Hiak, she actually offered to sell the property to OCBC to settle Hoh Weng Cheong`s debt. In other words, she was initially prepared to accept the fraud perpetrated on her and to rescue her son even at the expense of losing her home, provided something could be salvaged. It was only when she could not carry out her rescue plan on acceptable terms that she decided to exercise her full legal rights and remedies.
  
 
 
In the circumstances, I am prepared to accept her account that she was tricked by Hoh Weng Cheong into signing the mortgage and that, when she signed the two sheets of paper forming the last two pages of the mortgage document, she did not know the nature of the document.
 Non est factum
This, however, is not the end of the matter. I now have to consider whether, in the circumstances of this case, the plea of non est factum can be applied. It is therefore necessary to consider the legal requirements for the application of this doctrine.
As a preliminary point, the parties accept that, apart from non est factum, the mortgage is an effective legal document, notwithstanding the forged signature of the plaintiff`s husband. Since the property was held by the parties as joint tenants, upon the death of the plaintiff`s husband on 27 June 1984, his undivided half share automatically vested in the plaintiff by virtue of her jus accrescendi. Accordingly, on 28 June 1984, his signature was no longer necessary to make the legal mortgage effective (although it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff or Hoh Weng Cheong would have known this). The plaintiff`s signature was all that is required for its validity and, if I find that the defence of non est factum does not apply, then the mortgage will be effective as such.
The modern law on this subject has been restated by the House of Lords in 
 Saunders v Anglia Building Society 
 1 (often referred to under its alternative name, 
 Gallie v Lee 
). Although each of the Law Lords chose to formulate the doctrine in his own words, three of the judges indicated that they were in general agreement with the speech of Lord Pearson and, as this is a well-known case, it is sufficient for me to quote a short passage from his judgment (at p 1034): 
 
In my opinion, the plea of non est factum ought to be available in a proper case for the relief of a person who for permanent or temporary reasons (not limited to blindness or illiteracy) is not capable of both reading and sufficiently understanding the deed or other document to be signed. By `sufficiently understanding` I mean understanding at least to the point of detecting a fundamental difference between the actual document and the document as the signer had believed it to be. There must be a proper case for such relief. There would not be a proper case if (a) the signature of the document was brought about by negligence of the signer in failing to take precautions which he ought to have taken, or (b) the actual document was not fundamentally different from the document as the signer believed it to be.
 
 
 
My earlier finding of fact enables the plaintiff to fulfil requirement (b) stated above (which I will call `the first requirement`). The documents signed by the plaintiff on 28 June 1984 were clearly fundamentally different from the documents which the plaintiff believed them to be. The plaintiff, however, still has to satisfy the other requirement (which I will call `the second requirement`) by showing that she was not negligent in signing the documents. In this regard Lord Pearson went on to say (at p 1037) : 
 
The word `negligence` in this connection [has] no special, technical meaning. It [means] carelessness, and in each case it [is] a question of fact for the jury to decide whether the person relying on the plea [has] been negligent or not.
 
 
 
Lord Pearson also said (at p 1035) : 
 
If a person forbears to read the document, he nearly always should be reckoned as negligent or otherwise debarred from succeeding on the plea of non est factum.
 
 
 
The concept of carelessness has also been explained by the High Court of Australia in 
 Petelin v Cullen 
 2 at p 360 : 
 
It is now settled beyond any shadow of doubt that when we speak of negligence or carelessness in connexion with non est factum we are not referring to the tort of negligence but to a mere failure to take reasonable precautions in ascertaining the character of a document before signing it. The insistence that such precautions should be taken as a condition of making out the defence is of fundamental importance when the defence is asserted against an innocent person, whether a third party to the transaction or not, who relies on the document and the signature which it bears and who is unaware of the circumstances in which it came to be executed.
 
 
 
There are many cases where the plea of non est factum has been raised, but relatively few where the plea has succeeded. Usually the plea has failed because the court has found that the signer knew the general nature of what he or she was signing, and therefore the first requirement has not been satisfied. However, there are cases where, regardless of the finding in relation to the first requirement, the court has examined the second requirement, the issue of carelessness. I will now discuss these cases.

Gallie v Lee

[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 itself, Mrs Gallie was asked by her nephew to sign a document which she could not read because she had broken her spectacles. She asked what it was, and her nephew`s companion (Lee) told her that it was a deed of gift of the house to her nephew. She executed it on that basis when in fact it was an assignment of her house by her to Lee. Mrs Gallie`s appeal failed because the court held that what she had signed was not fundamentally different from what she thought she had signed. However, Lord Pearson said (at p 1034) : 
 
In the present case the plaintiff was not at the material time a person who could read, because on the facts found she had broken her spectacles and could not effectively read without them. In any case her evidence (unless it was deliberately false, which has not been argued) shows that she had very little capacity for understanding legal documents and property transactions, and I do not think a reasonable jury would have found that she was negligent.
 
 
 
The modern doctrine of non est factum really commences with the decision in 
Foster v MacKinnon
 
[1868-69] LR 4 CP 704
 The defendant was induced to put his name on the back of a bill of exchange by the fraudulent representation that he was signing a guarantee. The jury was directed that, if his signature had been obtained by fraud and he signed it thinking it was a guarantee and not a bill, and if he was not guilty of any negligence in so signing, he was entitled to the verdict. The Court of Common Pleas approved the direction and made no finding on the facts.
In 
 National Provincial Bank of England v Jackson 
 ,4 Jackson, a solicitor, obtained from his sisters their signatures to two deeds. By each deed, in alleged consideration of the release of a debt of o400 and payment to them of o300, they conveyed their shares of mortgaged freehold property to Jackson. No money was at the time due from the sisters to Jackson, nor was any payment whatsoever made to them. The deeds were not read over or explained to the sisters, who had no idea that they were thereby conveying their property, and they signed in full reliance on Jackson`s statement that he was going to clear off the mortgage and wanted to send the deeds to the mortgagee. The issue of non est factum was one of the matters raised, as the sisters claimed that the conveyance they had signed was void on this ground. The English Court of Appeal rejected this contention. The court held that the sisters knew that what they were signing related in some way to the property, and this appears to be the main ground for its decision. However, Cotton LJ specifically said (at p 10) that the sisters had trusted Jackson `both as their brother and solicitor, and cannot be said to have been guilty of negligence in so doing`.
In 
 Bank of Australasia v Reynell 
,5 the defendant signed a guarantee to the plaintiff bank, thinking that his liability was limited to o500 when in fact the limit was o5,000. The New Zealand Court of Appeal denied the defendant`s plea of non est factum on the ground (among others) of his carelessness, since the amount secured was on the same page as his signature, and only a few lines above it. A single glance at the document would have shown the limit of o5,000.
In 
 Lewis v Clay 
 ,6 the plaintiff sued the defendant as one of two makers of two joint and several promissory notes. The other maker was Lord William Nevill, and the defendant admitted that he had signed the two notes, but contended that he did not know at the time of signing that they were promissory notes. The defendant had just turned 21, and had known Nevill intimately for some years. Nevill had asked him to witness some documents, producing a roll of papers covered up by blotting paper in which there were four openings. The defendant asked Nevill what the document was, but Nevill said that it was a private matter concerning his sister`s marriage settlement and certain pending divorce proceedings. The defendant, trusting Neville, did not insist on seeing the whole document, and accordingly signed in two of the openings (the other two being signed by Nevill himself). The defendant said that he had signed with the intention of doing so as witness to the signatures of Nevill, whose honour he had no reason to doubt. The jury found on these facts that the defendant had not been careless in signing the document, and Lord Russell of Killowen CJ accepted the finding of the jury on this point.
In 
 Awang bin Omar v Haji Omar bin Ismail & Anor 
 ,7 a Malay, who did not understand English, was induced by his brother to sign a contract in English on the representation that he was merely witnessing his brother`s signature. Laville J relied on 
Lewis v Clay
 
[1897] 67 LJQB 224
[1895] All ER Rep Ext 1738
 as authority for the proposition that `misplaced confidence in the person who obtains the signature by false pretences does not amount to such negligence as would negative the defence of non est factum` (at p 30). He therefore held that the `misplaced but natural confidence` placed by the Malay defendant in his brother was sufficient to establish the defence.
In 
 Credit Lyonnais v PT Barnard & Associates 
 ,8 a businessman who had attained seven `O` levels (but not French which he had ceased to study when he was 13 or 14) was persuaded to sign two documents which had been folded over and represented to him as receipts. He signed them on that basis when in fact they were bills of exchange in French. Mocatta J held that the defence of non est factum could not be established because the defendant had not discharged the burden of proving that the signer had acted carefully, but had in fact acted with `a remarkable lack of normal business prudence`. Mocatta J found the following factors relevant: 
 
 
(a) the defendant could have observed the dates on the document which were considerably earlier than the date that he was asked to sign; 
 
(b) certain tell-tale words could have been seen by him which would have at least put him on inquiry; 
 
(c) no explanation was given to him why the documents were folded and why he did not ask for them to be unfolded before signing; 
 
(d) there was no valid reason for the receipts to be required or to have any use; and 
 
(e) in any event, there was no reason for him to sign a receipt for goods without checking whether the goods had arrived.

United Dominions Trust Ltd v Western
 
[1976] QB 513
[1975] 3 All ER 1017
[1976] 2 WLR 64
 the defendant agreed to buy a car from dealers on hire purchase. After paying the deposit, he signed the plaintiff finance company`s standard form in blank, leaving the dealers to fill in the figures. The figures were inserted incorrectly by the dealers. The defendant, when sued on this document, sought to raise the defence of non est factum. The English Court of Appeal refused to allow this plea, holding that there was no distinction between careless signing of a completed document and a document in blank, and that, in permitting the dealers to complete the contractual document, the onus was on the defendant to show that he had acted carefully, and that onus had not been discharged.
In 
 Bank of China v Chia Sook Lan Maria 
,10 the Singapore Court of Appeal had to deal with a plea of non est factum by a businesswoman who had signed a confirmation of deposit of title deeds under an alleged misrepresentation as to their nature, the businesswoman being Chinese-educated and the document being in English. Her contention was that she was told that her liability on the guarantee was limited to $100,000, when in fact it was unlimited. The Court of Appeal found that, while her English was poor and she could not communicate or understand properly in English, she had not established that she could not read simple English with understanding, particularly that she could not read the guarantee with understanding and not realize that her liability was unlimited. Accordingly, the court held that her carelessness precluded her reliance on the doctrine of non est factum. She appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but the ground of non est factum was not relied on before the Judicial Committee, which dismissed her appeal.
In 
 Avon Finance Co Ltd v Bridger 
 ,11 the defendants, an elderly couple, unknowingly signed a legal charge of their property on their son`s representation that it was in connection with a mortgage which they themselves were taking out on the property, when in fact the charge was to secure a loan from another lender to the son. The papers were folded and they did not read them. The English Court of Appeal held that the doctrine of non est factum did not apply. Brandon LJ specifically found that the defendants did not exercise such reasonable care as was appropriate in the circumstances in entering into the transaction.

 Zainal Abidin bin Jawi v Mat Hassan Abdul & Anor 
 ,12 Lim Beng Choon J dismissed a defence of non est factum by a defendant, who alleged that he had signed a power of attorney empowering another party to sell his land under a misrepresentation, without stating the nature of the misrepresentation. Lim Beng Choon J quoted the speech of Lord Reid in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 highlighting those passages dealing with the necessity for a signer of a document to try and find out the general effect of that document. No further analysis, however, was made of the element of carelessness.
In 
 Goh Jong Cheng v MB Melwani Pte Ltd 
 ,13 the plaintiff, the owner of a property, was taken by her son to his lawyer`s office, where she signed a mortgage of the property in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff was an illiterate hotel cleaner aged 54 years. Her evidence was that, some time prior to the visit to the lawyer`s office, she had handed the title deeds to her son at his request to enable him to verify whether the title deeds were correct. When she went to the lawyer`s office, she was told that she had to sign a document to get back the title deeds. No one explained to her the contents of the documents that she was required to sign. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then was) held that the plaintiff was able to set aside the mortgage on the ground of non est factum. He accepted her evidence that she did not know that the title deeds were to be used for a mortgage to secure credit facilities to her son`s company. He said (at p 487): 
 
The son had deceived his mother who had remained unsuspecting. Having regard to her background, I think she could not really be expected to be worldly-wise. It is not unreasonable for a mother not to suspect that her son would harm or cheat her.
 
 
 
Although Chao Hick Tin JC did not specifically state the reason why the plea of non est factum applied, he had, earlier in his judgment, set out a summary of the decision in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 quoting the passage from Lord Pearson`s judgment that I have earlier quoted. Against that background, the passage that I have just quoted from Chao Hick Tin JC`s judgment must indicate that he had considered the issue of carelessness, and had found that the plaintiff had not been careless in signing the document which ultimately proved to be a mortgage.
In 
 Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Tay Keow Neo & Anor 
 ,14 the defendants had executed a guarantee in favour of the plaintiff. Their main defence was that the guarantee was obtained under the undue influence of their former employer but they also relied on the plea of non est factum. However, their evidence was that they were at all times loyal and dedicated to their employer, and did whatever that was required of them by him without question. They signed documents whenever and wherever they were asked to sign. They never read those documents they signed, nor were they told of the nature of the documents or their contents by anyone. They were not provided with copies of those documents they had signed, and were under the overpowering influence of their employer. On this basis, it was not surprising that Rubin JC found (at p 223) that the defendants had executed the guarantee `perhaps without reasonable care`. He then cited the principle that non est factum could only be relied on if reasonable care had been exercised in the circumstances in connection with the transaction.
In 
 Lloyds Bank v Waterhouse 
 ,15 an illiterate farmer signed a guarantee of a loan to his son by the plaintiff bank. He believed that the loan and guarantee were related to the purchase of a farm land by his son, and was given information by the bank`s officers to that effect. In fact, the guarantee also covered an overdraft facility for the son`s business and, when the son`s business collapsed, the farmer was sued on his guarantee. The English Court of Appeal upheld his plea of non est factum, holding that there had been no carelessness on his part.
No clear pattern emerges from these cases; no attempt has been made to develop the concept of carelessness through the cases, and for that reason they are not of direct assistance to me in deciding whether or not the plaintiff had been careless. It has been emphasized in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 that the issue of carelessness is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case. Each of the cases above turns on its own peculiar facts, although it may help me to know how other judges have approached this question.
The cases where the courts have held that the signers have been careless are self-explanatory. However, I need to make some comment on those cases where the courts have considered (without necessarily deciding) that the signer signed without carelessness. 
 
 
(a) 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 Mrs Gallie was effectively unable to read at the time because she had broken her glasses and, even if she had been able to read, she would not have understood anything relating to legal documents and property transactions. However, Lord Pearson, alone among all the judges in the three courts, thought that she had not been careless. Clearly this was obiter, since her claim failed on the ground that the document she signed was not radically or fundamentally different from what she thought it to be. However, it should be appreciated that the finding by Lord Pearson that Mrs Gallie had not been careless was on the basis that she was in effect blind, since she could not read without her spectacles, which were broken. She therefore had to rely completely on the explanation of the document given by Lee. 
 
(b) 
National Provincial Bank v Jackson
 
[1886] 33 Ch D 1
 The main ground of decision was in effect the first requirement of non est factum, namely, that the document signed was not fundamentally different from what the sisters thought them to be. However, Cotton LJ thought that they had not been careless in signing. I could play sophist, and distinguish that case from ours on the grounds that 
 
Mr Jackson was not only the brother of the signers, but also their solicitor. However, it seems to me that the remarks of Cotton LJ were unjustified on the facts of the case as reported, since there was no evidence that the sisters were illiterate or unable to read, and simply chose blindly to rely on their brother. Whatever the relationship between the signer and the person asking for the signature, it cannot be right that a person who deliberately chooses not to read a document, particularly one to be signed in a solicitor`s office, can claim not to be careless. However, Cotton LJ`s finding was approved by Viscount Dilhorne in 
Gallie v Lee

 This is a case from Victorian England where the issue of carelessness was decided by a jury, although the Lord Chief Justice appeared to agree with the verdict. I believe that the unspoken premise of the jury`s verdict was that the trust placed by the defendant on the word of an English nobleman was entirely reasonable, particularly where a matter of his sister`s private affairs was concerned. I venture to suggest that a modern English jury would not make the same finding, and a judge in Singapore would certainly view this decision with some caution. I have to point out, however, that this case was approved by Lord Pearson in 
Gallie v Lee

  The representations made by the plaintiff`s son in this case were that the plaintiff had to sign a document to obtain the return of title deeds from a solicitor. Since she had voluntarily surrendered the title deeds for verification that they were correct, the representations were plausible enough in the circumstances for her to believe that it was necessary to sign a document for their return. I do not think that Chao Hick Tin JC was laying down a universal truth that it is always reasonable for mothers not to suspect their sons of cheating them. 
 
(f) 
Lloyds Bank v Waterhouse
 
[1992] 3 CL para 234
 The brief report I have seen does not indicate why the court thought there was no carelessness. Possibly it was due to the circumstances of the misrepresentations made by the bank: this would be consistent with the ruling of the High Court of Australia in 
Petelin v Cullen
 
[1975] 132 CLR 355
 that, where the defence of non est factum is asserted against the other party to the transaction, who knows or has reason to suspect that the document was executed under misapprehension as to its character, the lack of care of a signer will not of itself defeat the plea of non est factum.
  
 
 
There are other cases dealing with the negligence of a signer of a document in the context of the defence of non est factum, but they are either based on the tortious concept of negligence, or employ the language of estoppel by negligence, both of which concepts were expressly disapproved by the House of Lords in 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 I therefore omit any analysis of the reasoning in those cases. (Care has to be taken in analysing any case on carelessness decided between 
Carlisle and Cumberland Banking Co v Bragg
 
[1911] 1 KB 489
 which introduced these heterodox concepts, and 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 in 1971.)
At the end of this analysis, I find that the most helpful statement of the law on the element of carelessness in non est factum is the following extract from the speech of Lord Wilberforce in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 which was described by Scott LJ in 
 Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v Steed 
 17 at p 678 as: `[expressing] the approach and the principles that must be applied to a non est factum plea`. Lord Wilberforce said (at p 1027): 
 
In my opinion, the correct rule, ... is that, leaving aside negotiable instruments to which special rules may apply, a person who signs a document, and parts with it so that it may come into other hands, has a responsibility, that of the normal man of prudence, to take care what he signs, which, if neglected, prevents him from denying his liability under the document according to its tenor. I would add that the onus of proof in this matter rests upon him, ie to prove that he acted carefully, and not upon the third party to prove the contrary. ...
 
 
 
The preceding paragraphs contemplate persons who are adult and literate: the conclusion as to such persons is that, while there are cases in which they may successfully plead non est factum these cases will, in modern times, be rare.
As to persons who are illiterate, or blind, or lacking in understanding, the law is in a dilemma. On the one hand, the law is traditionally, and rightly, ready to relieve them against hardship and imposition. On the other hand, regard has to be paid to the position of innocent third parties who cannot be expected, and often would have no means, to know the condition or status of the signer. I do not think that a defined solution can be provided for all cases. The law ought, in my opinion, to give relief if satisfied that consent was truly lacking but will require of signers even in this class that they act responsibly and carefully according to their circumstances in putting their signature to legal documents.
The problem in our case, however, is that the plaintiff is neither literate nor illiterate in English, but somewhere in between.
Let me now turn to an analysis of the facts in our case. I find that the relevant factors are as follows. 
 
 
(a) The plaintiff was relatively old at the time of the signing (about 65). 
 
(b) Hoh Weng Cheong was her son, and a person whom she trusted. 
 
(c) The critical factor is the plaintiff`s understanding of English at the material time. She had been taught to read and write and speak in English at school, although she claimed that she could not read an English newspaper or write an English sentence. She admitted, however, that she could: 
 
(i) write the English alphabet, 
 
(ii) sign her name in English (which in fact meant writing her name in full), 
 
(iii) recognize her son`s name in English, 
 
(iv) recognize the address of her property, and 
 
(v) recognize Arabic numerals. 
 
My conclusion is that, while she was probably at best functionally semi-literate in English, she had some degree of familiarity with the language. I will return to the significance of this later. 
 
(d) She was a little equivocal about whether she had actually read the documents she was asked to sign. At first, she said that she did not pay attention to various aspects of the documents but, when asked directly whether she had read the documents, she said that she had not, because she did not understand English and therefore there was no point in reading them. However, she admitted that she had put on her spectacles when Hoh Weng Cheong showed her the documents, but I took her answer to mean that this was only for the purpose of signing. My conclusion is therefore that she deliberately chose not to read the documents, relying instead on Hoh Weng Cheong`s explanation as sufficient without querying or checking. 
 
(e) As a teacher, she must have been familiar with testimonials, although she denied actually having seen many testimonials in the course of her work. She admitted, however, that she had occasionally seen a form of testimonial. She also admitted that Hoh Weng Cheong had told her that the testimonial would be shown to other businessmen. The sheets of paper which she signed contained several features which a person with a basic knowledge of English and a reasonable amount of common sense would have noticed were inconsistent with the explanation that they were testimonials. 
 
(i) The two sheets were conveyancing sized paper, and were significantly larger than paper normally used for correspondence. 
 
(ii) The two documents were headed `10` and `11` respectively, indicating that they were part of a much longer document. 
 
(iii) Hoh Weng Cheong`s name did not appear on either document, even though they were supposed to be a testimonial about him. 
 
(iv) Page 10 contained peculiar figures such as `150.1 (square metres)`, `(Lot) 162-75`, `(Mukim) 25`, `(Grant No) 80`, which could not possibly have had any bearing on the personal qualities of Hoh Weng Cheong. 
 
(v) The address of the property, No 64 Lorong 24A, Geylang, Singapore, was also stated on p 10, thus suggesting that the document had something to do with the property. 
 
(vi) On p 11 there were two lines clearly indicating spaces for signatures (in fact for the director and secretary of Sourgrapes). This should have led to a query why someone else would be signing this page apart from the plaintiff. 
 
(vii) The plaintiff was required to sign in the middle of the attestation certificate on p 11 in the heart of a cluster of words with other blanks yet to be filled in, yet the plaintiff did not feel it strange to sign there, nor did she ask what the other blanks were for. 
 
(viii) Since pp 10 and 11 were clearly different, the plaintiff must (or should) have wondered why she had to sign twice. When I asked her whether she thought she was signing two separate letters, she said that she signed thinking it was a testimonial. When I pressed her on this, she simply said she did not think about it. 
 
My conclusion is therefore that, even with her limited command of English, if she had taken the trouble to look at the pages she was signing with any degree of care, some or all of these peculiarities should have struck her. 
 
(f) On the plaintiff`s own evidence, Hoh Weng Cheong had told her that this letter would be shown to other businessmen. The general format of the documents would have indicated that these were documents of some degree of formality, unlike a letter to a friend or relative. She should therefore have questioned him as to what exactly she was supposed to be saying about him to outsiders. Her failure to query him suggests that she was prepared to put her name to anything he wanted her to say about him. 
 
(g) Were I less charitable in my view of the plaintiff`s command of English, I would have said that the pages she was asked to sign were clearly conveyancing documents to anyone with a working knowledge of English. 
 
(h) It is difficult to imagine that a reasonable person, even one with a limited knowledge of English, would not have realized that the way in which the words were laid out on the pages (which possibly included the signatures of other persons, as well as the red seals) were not appropriate for a testimonial. 
 
(i) Above all, she should have realized that the excuse of the testimonial must have been a flagrant untruth, since no businessman would be likely to rely on a testimonial on Hoh Weng Cheong`s behalf given by his mother. 
 
(j) I have not forgotten that the papers were placed before the plaintiff to sign on the day after her husband`s death. However, it is impossible for me to factor this element into my assessment of the plaintiff`s degree of carelessness because nothing was made of this point in her evidence. She did not say that she was flustered or confused at the time when Hoh Weng Cheong asked her to sign the documents, or that her grief had clouded her judgment, and I cannot presume that she was so emotionally distraught that she should, viewed objectively, have been excused from looking at the documents more carefully, or from asking Hoh Weng Cheong more questions about them. Indeed, although it is extremely difficult to generalize about what a reasonable widow should have done on the day after her husband`s death when faced with such a situation, it might be said that the plaintiff should have told Hoh Weng Cheong not to bother her at a time when she was in deep mourning, especially when the matter was obviously not urgent.
  
 
 
Ultimately the question I have to ask myself is this. What should a reasonable person, possessing the qualities that the plaintiff did, have done when faced with the request from her son to sign the two pages? My conclusion is that, even if I treat her as functionally semi-literate in English, if she had read (or tried to read) the two pages, she would have realized, or at least suspected, that the pages she was asked to sign were not what they were made out to be by Hoh Weng Cheong. This in turn would have led to queries being made of him, possibly with Hoh May Ying being asked to assist, and I cannot presume that Hoh Weng Cheong would have been able to survive the plaintiff`s queries, particularly if she had asked him to translate the contents of the two pages and to explain the various matters set out in sub-para (e) above. Since she did not read the pages, she deprived herself of the opportunity to be put on notice, and I consider this carelessness.
At the end of the day, the onus of proving that she had not been careless (and Lord Reid in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 (at p 1016) described the onus as `a heavy burden`) lies on the plaintiff, and I find that she has not discharged this onus. This is not the same as saying that she has been fraudulent (a point made by Russell LJ in 
 Gallie v Lee 
 in the Court of Appeal [1969] 2 Ch 17 at p 40).
I have to bear in mind that non est factum is a dangerous doctrine for commercial, industrial, financial and even government institutions who routinely receive documents signed by parties outside the presence of the institutions receiving them. If non est factum were to become an easy doctrine to invoke, no institution could feel secure that such parties would not one day disclaim their signatures and invoke the doctrine by saying they had been tricked into signing the document, and had relied on someone close to them, a defence relatively easy to raise and difficult to rebut (even though the onus of proof would be on the signer). The attitude of the courts in modern times has been to restrict this plea as much as possible. In 
 Gallie v Lee 
 ,1 Lord Reid said (at p 1015) that the doctrine: 
 
must be kept within narrow limits if it is not to shake the confidence of those who habitually and rightly rely on signatures when there is no obvious reason to doubt their validity.
 
 
 
The current judicial attitude is stated by Scott LJ in Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v Steed (at p 676) : 
 
It is easy to understand why the plea is likely to be unsuccessful. A person who signs a document at the request of another puts into circulation a document on which, depending on its contents, others may rely. Where a fraudster has tricked, first, the signer of the document, in order to induce the signature, and then some third party, who is induced to rely on the signed document, which of the two victims is the law to prefer? The authorities indicate that the answer is almost invariably, the latter. The signer of the document has, by signing, enabled the fraud to be carried out, enabled the false document to go into circulation.
 
 
 
In the present case OCBC is clearly an innocent party, and, for the plaintiff to succeed, she would have to show exceptional circumstances over and above a simple plea that she was deceived by her son. Relatives sign guarantees for each other all the time, and fraud and deception between relatives is not a rarity. Although the plaintiff is an aggrieved party, she has not made out a case for relief at the expense of OCBC, but will have to seek her remedies elsewhere.
Accordingly, although I find that the first requirement of the non est factum defence has been established, the plaintiff fails on the second requirement. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider the possible difficulties of giving effect to the doctrine in respect of a Torrens title mortgage (see 
 PT Ltd v Maradona Pty Ltd 
 18 at pp 675-683).
The plaintiff`s claim against OCBC is therefore dismissed, and OCBC is entitled to judgment against the plaintiff on its counterclaim.
 Joint and several guarantee
Another point that was not raised in the pleadings, but troubled me initially, was whether the guarantee given by the plaintiff (which the mortgage was expressed to secure) was still valid notwithstanding the death of the plaintiff`s husband, since the guarantee was expressed to be joint and several with her husband. However, on further reflection, I consider that this is not an impediment to the validity of either the guarantee or the mortgage. It is true that a joint and several guarantor normally has a right to expect his co-guarantors to be equally bound, and a clause in the guarantee providing that the liability of the guarantors will be `joint and several` normally carries with it the implication that the guarantee will not be binding unless all those named in the guarantee execute it (see 
 Rowlett on Principal and Surety 
 (4th Ed, 1982) at p 182, 
 The Modern Contract of Guarantee 
 by James O`Donovan and John Phillips (1st Ed, 1985) at pp 69-71 and 
Indian Bank v Ramachandran & Ors
 
 
[1991] 3 MLJ 241
  ). However, this implication need not necessarily be drawn, and, if the evidence shows that, notwithstanding the phrase `joint and several`, one guarantor signed without any expectation that the other named guarantor would sign, he can be bound despite the absence of the co-guarantor`s signature.
Although in practice it is assumed that a co-guarantor would not intend to be bound if the other co-guarantor would not be similarly bound, it is generally accepted that this presumption can be rebutted if it can clearly be shown that the first co-guarantor would have signed regardless of the other guarantor`s signature (see 
 The Modern Contract of Guarantee 
 at p 71). In 
 Walter and Morris Ltd v Lymberis 
 ,20 the Supreme Court of South Australia held that a guarantee signed by an individual guarantor was binding even though it was in a form appropriate to a joint and several guarantee. The court accepted the finding of the trial judge that the guarantor, when he signed the guarantee, contemplated that no other person was intended to be a guarantor jointly with him.
In the present case, the plaintiff is deemed to be bound by her signature because she has not been able successfully to invoke the plea of non est factum. However, her evidence clearly shows that she did not intend that her husband should sign as co-guarantor for the simple reason that she never knew that she was signing a guarantee. Indeed, once it is found that she is bound by her signature, she cannot be heard to say that her liability as guarantor was dependent on her husband`s signature since she knew, at the time of signing, that he was dead.
In the circumstances, I do not think it would be open to her, even if she had raised the defence, to say that she would not have signed the guarantee unless her husband had also signed it. I mention this point simply for the sake of completeness as it was not raised by the plaintiff as a ground for setting aside the mortgage or in answer to OCBC`s claim against her as guarantor.
 Claim in negligence
I now turn to the plaintiff`s claim against the third defendants, which only falls to be considered in the event that her claim against OCBC fails.
The plaintiff`s claim against the third defendants is based on the alleged negligence of the legal assistant, who was employed by them at the material time in: 
 
 
(i) witnessing what purported to be the two signatures of the mortgagors, and 
 
(ii) signing the attestation certificate at the end of the mortgage when in fact neither the plaintiff nor her husband had appeared before him to sign the mortgage or to acknowledge that they had signed the document.
  
 
 
There was an alternative claim for conspiracy, but no evidence was led in furtherance of this claim, and counsel for the plaintiff acknowledged that it had been abandoned.
The defence of the third defendants to the claim of negligence is three-fold. 
 
 
(1) The legal assistant acted in this transaction in his personal capacity. 
 
(2) The legal assistant acted outside the scope of his authority and outside the course of his employment. 
 
(3) The third defendants cannot be liable to the plaintiff in negligence because: 
 
(a) no duty of care was owed to the plaintiff, not being a client of the third defendants; 
 
(b) the plaintiff is not entitled to make a claim based on financial loss; and 
 
(c) the effective cause of the plaintiff`s loss is the failure of Sourgrapes or its directors to repay the sums advanced by OCBC, which were secured by the mortgage.
  
 
 
The third defendants have led no primary evidence to rebut the evidence of the plaintiff. The first defence was not seriously pursued, and I therefore treat the legal assistant as having acted in the name of the third defendants. The legal assistant gave evidence on his own behalf. It is clear from his evidence that he had allowed Hoh Weng Cheong to take the mortgage away for his parents to sign, and the legal assistant then signed as a witness to the two signatures (which he had not in fact witnessed) and also signed the attestation certificate in the form prescribed by s 12(6)(b) of the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap 269).
I therefore have to consider, whether under these circumstances, there is any liability on the part of (a) the legal assistant and (b) the third defendants to the plaintiff.
The first question to consider is whether a duty of care was owed by the legal assistant to the plaintiff. The curious situation arises in this case that, while the plaintiff never engaged the legal assistant or the third defendants to act for her in the mortgage (because she was not aware that there was a mortgage transaction involving her house) she now brings her claim against the legal assistant and the third defendants effectively on the basis that she was their client.
I consider that a duty of care can exist in these circumstances. Although a solicitor`s duty to his client arises primarily from contract, a person can be a client of a solicitor even if there is no contract between them. 
 Donaldson v Haldane 
 ,21 is commonly cited by various textbooks as authority for this proposition. A more recent authority is 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 .22 In this case, the plaintiff was an elderly widow whose son wanted her to grant a mortgage over her home as security for a loan to be made to him. He took her to the solicitor who was acting for both the mortgagee and himself. At this interview the solicitor told the plaintiff that she should take independent advice, but she declined on the grounds that she trusted her son. The solicitor had made no inquiry about the financial circumstances of either the son nor the mother, nor did he discuss the proposed transaction with the mother outside the presence of the son. At the end of the interview, she signed the mortgage. Later, the son defaulted on his obligations and became bankrupt. The widow was called on to pay the moneys secured by the mortgage. She sued the solicitor`s firm, alleging negligence in both tort and contract. The case proceeded on the basis that this interview occurred before the solicitor had been formally retained by the mother, and therefore his duty to her at this stage was purely in tort. The New Zealand Court of Appeal found that he was negligent in: 
 
 
(a) failing to ensure that the plaintiff had her own independent advice in respect of the transaction; and 
 
(b) failing to refuse to act for her when he was already acting for the son.
  
 
 
The Court of Appeal saw no difficulty about holding the solicitor liable in tort even in respect of pre-contractual advice, namely, advice given before the contractual relationship of solicitor and client came into being.
In our case, the solicitors for OCBC had written to the third defendants treating them as solicitors for the plaintiff and her husband as mortgagors (see, for example, their letter of 26 June 1984). Requisitions on title had also been sent to the third defendants to be answered on behalf of the mortgagors, and the mortgage itself was sent to them for the mortgagors` signatures to be obtained and their address to be inserted. The legal assistant, on behalf of the third defendants, attended to all necessary matters on behalf of the plaintiff and her husband as purported mortgagors (including signing the requisitions on title as their solicitors). Clearly, the legal assistant had assumed the responsibility of acting as solicitor for the plaintiff and her husband, even though he had not met them and had not raised any bill against them (his firm`s legal fees presumably being paid by Sourgrapes). It therefore follows that the legal assistant owed the plaintiff the same duty and standard of care that he owed to a paying client (see 44 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed, 1983) at para 131).
Given the existence of a duty of care, has the legal assistant breached the required standard of care? The legal assistant`s actions in signing the mortgage as a witness and issuing his attestation certificate were clearly acts of negligence, falling short of the standard of reasonable care and skill expected from a reasonably competent solicitor, however inexperienced. No attempt was made to defend his conduct on this score, and a partner of the third defendants, who gave evidence on their behalf, in fact stated unequivocally that the proper course of action for the legal assistant in this case would have been to visit the plaintiff and her husband to witness their signatures if he was told that they were unavailable to appear before him.
In the circumstances, the issue of financial loss is a red herring. There is no universal rule that a claim based on the tort of negligence cannot be made in respect of financial loss; indeed, once it is accepted that a client can sue his solicitor in tort as well as in contract (and I accept the line of authorities establishing that there are concurrent duties in contract and tort for professional negligence) it follows that the damages arising from a solicitor`s negligence must, in most cases, be financial. If authority is needed for this proposition, I would only refer to 
 Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
 23 and 
 Ross v Caunters 
 24 as examples.
I appreciate that this is a slightly unusual case of solicitor`s negligence where the primary negligence alleged is not anything said or done to the client but the statements made by the legal assistant to a third party resulting in loss to the plaintiff. However: 
 
 
(a) there are precedents for liability being imposed in negligence in such a situation (see, for example, 
Ministry of Housing and Local Government v Sharp
 
[1970] 2 QB 223
[1970] 1 All ER 1009
[1970] 2 WLR 802
 and 
Pisano v Fairfield City Council
 
[1991] Aus Torts Reports 81
 ); 
 
(b) the negligent misstatements ought not to be analysed in the context discussed in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners
 
[1964] AC 465
[1963] 2 All ER 575
[1963] 3 WLR 101
 but simply viewed as negligence in carrying out a solicitor`s professional duty (albeit set in a tortious rather than a contractual context) because, unlike 
Hedley Byrne
 
[1964] AC 465
[1963] 2 All ER 575
[1963] 3 WLR 101
 the misstatements made in this case resulted in loss to the solicitor`s own client, not a third party; and 
 
(c) in any event, the legal assistant was negligent in not seeing the plaintiff before witnessing her signature and attesting her acknowledgment, and this would not be a negligent misstatement, but a negligent act or omission.
  
 
 
In passing, I would mention that, if the plaintiff had been completely successful in establishing her case of non est factum, OCBC would then have had to press its case against the third defendants for negligence, and I would have seen no conceptual difficulty in upholding such a claim (see 
Allied Finance and Investments Ltd v Haddow & Co
 
[1983] NZLR 22
 which I prefer to the more recent English case, 
Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd
 
[1992] 2 WLR 867
[1992] 1 All ER 865
 ). In short, whichever way one looks at the facts, there is no difficulty in concluding that the legal assistant is liable for negligence.
The defence of causation (or the lack of it) raised by the third defendants can be disposed of quickly. Pang Tee Hiak testified that OCBC would rely on its solicitors` confirmation that the mortgage documents were in order before releasing the facilities. Chan Weng Kee, the solicitor acting for OCBC, testified that he relied on the legal assistant`s signature as witness to the mortgagors` signatures as well as his attestation certificate in arriving at his (Chan Weng Kee`s) conclusion that the mortgage had been duly signed, after which he reported to OCBC that Sourgrapes could utilize the banking facilities. I appreciate that the witness to the mortgagors` signatures did not have to be a lawyer, and that the purpose of the attestation certificate is to fulfil registration requirements rather than to satisfy the mortgagees` solicitors. Nonetheless, the causative link between the legal assistant`s conduct and the release of the facilities is clear. It is another red herring to argue that what has caused the plaintiff`s loss is the failure of Sourgrapes and its directors to repay the advances. The plaintiff should never have been put in a position where she was at risk as guarantor and mortgagor to OCBC: it is this risk which was the foreseeable result of the legal assistant`s negligence, and the only argument can be about the extent of responsibility to attribute to the legal assistant.
 Vicarious liability
I must now deal with the issue of vicarious liability. The plaintiff is not suing the legal assistant directly, but the third defendants as his employers at the material time. The question is therefore whether the legal assistant`s negligence can be said to be outside the course of his employment, that being the only criterion on which to determine the issue of vicarious liability in tort. Several cases were cited, but it is only necessary to refer to the following passage from Salmond and Heuston on 
 The Law of Torts 
 (20th Ed, 1992) at pp 456-457: 
 
A master is not responsible for a wrongful act done by his servant unless it is done in the course of his employment. It is deemed to be so done if it is either (1) a wrongful act authorized by the master, or (2) a wrongful and unauthorized mode of doing some act authorized by the master. ... But a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorized, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorized that they may rightly be regarded as modes - although improper modes - of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorizes his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it. If a servant does negligently that which he was authorized to do carefully, or if he does fraudulently that which he was authorized to do honestly, or if he does mistakenly that which he was authorized to do correctly, his master will answer for that negligence, fraud or mistake. On the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible: for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. [Citation of authorities omitted.]
 
 
 
This paragraph has been approved by different courts on many occasions (see fn 35 on p 457), and covers the point better than the various cases cited to me by counsel.
Clearly, the legal assistant was doing negligently what he was employed to do carefully, and the third defendants must therefore accept vicarious liability for his negligence. On any criterion it cannot be said that what he was doing was wholly outside his job. In 
 Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 
 (16th Ed, 1989), it is stated (at para 3-22): 
 
An employee acting on his own initiative (rather than his employer`s) may be acting within the course of his employment. This will be the case where the employer either expressly or by implication has given the employee a discretion which he must exercise in the course of his employment. The employer will be liable for a wrongful exercise of such a discretion.
 
 
 
The evidence of the third defendants` partner in this case was that there were no restrictions on the scope of work done by the legal assistant, and that any other firm was entitled to assume that he was authorized to deal with mortgage transactions. Nothing else was said on this point, and I therefore assume that the legal assistant was free to do whatever work that was within the scope of normal legal practice in his own way (although no instructions were specifically given to him on how to sign attestation certificates). Accordingly, the third defendants would be vicariously liable for the legal assistant`s negligence in this transaction.
 Contributory negligence
It follows from my earlier remarks that the question of the plaintiff`s own responsibility for the loss ought to be considered. The only difficulty was that the defence of contributory negligence had not been pleaded by the third defendants. It is clear that such a defence needs to be pleaded (see `Contributory Negligence - Who Should Plead?` by KS Dass 
 
 [1992] 2 MLJ 
 lxxxi). At my invitation, after closing submissions had been made, counsel for the third defendants made an application to amend his defence to plead contributory negligence. This application was opposed by junior counsel for the plaintiff, who cited the following passage from the speech of Lord Griffiths in 
Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd
 
[1987] AC 189
[1988] 1 All ER 38
[1987] 2 WLR 312
 at p 220: 
 
Furthermore, whatever may have been the rule of conduct a hundred years ago, today it is not the practice invariably to allow a defence which is wholly different from that pleaded to be raised by amendment at the end of the trial even on terms that an adjournment is granted and that the defendant pays all the costs thrown away. There is a clear difference between allowing amendments to clarify the issues in dispute and those that permit a distinct defence to be raised for the first time.
 
 
 
Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion of the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise of the discretion by his assessment of where justice lies. Many and diverse factors will bear on the exercise of this discretion. I do not think it possible to enumerate them all or wise to attempt to do so. But justice cannot always be measured in terms of money and in my view a judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues, the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate expectation that the trial will determine the issues one way or the other. Furthermore to allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely different defence.
Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be conducted efficiently. We can no longer afford to show the same indulgence towards the negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age. There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of the negligence of the lawyers to fall on their own heads rather than by allowing an amendment at a very late stage of the proceedings.
The plaintiff`s counsel`s main ground of objection was that an offer of settlement had been made earlier, which had been declined by the plaintiff on the state of the pleadings as they then stood. The issue of contributory negligence had never previously been raised, and the application was now made at such a late stage that costs would not be adequate compensation. She agreed, however, that, if the amendment were allowed, no further amendment to her own pleadings was required, nor would it be necessary for witnesses to be recalled. There was no objection from the other parties, nor did they seek any consequential orders apart from costs.
I allowed the amendment for the following reasons. The plaintiff`s counsel conceded that the matter was one for my discretion, as reaffirmed by the speech of Lord Griffiths himself. In exercising my discretion, I considered carefully the words of Lord Griffiths, but found that the balance of justice demanded that the amendment be allowed. While the plaintiff was a personal litigant and the third defendants might (to stretch a point) be described as a business corporation, the true defendant was the legal assistant, a personal litigant who would bear the primary responsibility for satisfying any judgment. The fact situation in this case was quite different from that in 
 Ketteman 
 .30 There was no defence of limitation (which was an important consideration in 
 Ketteman 
 30), and it could not be said that contributory negligence was an entirely different defence or an entirely new issue.
On the pleadings, the plaintiff`s own claim against the third defendants was based mainly on conspiracy, with an alternative (but somewhat muted) claim for negligence. The defence of the third defendants, as it stood at the beginning of the trial, raised two defences to the allegation of negligence: 
 
 
(a) a denial that the plaintiff was entitled in law to sue for negligence because she was not their client, and because the loss suffered was purely financial; 
 
(b) a denial that the acts of the legal assistant were the cause of the damage suffered.
  
 
 
In this sense, the defence of contributory negligence was a fresh defence. However, unlike 
Ketteman
 
[1987] AC 189
[1988] 1 All ER 38
[1987] 2 WLR 312
 the issue of the plaintiff`s negligence was always a live issue, both on the pleadings and on the evidence in the course of the trial. By basing her claim on non est factum, the plaintiff took upon herself the burden of satisfying the two-fold test in 
Gallie v Lee
 
[1971] AC 1004
[1970] 3 All ER 961
[1970] 3 WLR 1078
 so the issue of her own carelessness was in the forefront at all stages of this case. It was precisely because of the evidence of the plaintiff that the question of contributory negligence emerged as one that had to be considered.
In any event, the third defendants had, in their original defence, specifically contended that the plaintiff had acted recklessly or negligently (or both) and without due regard or concern over the consequences of her act (although this pleading was made in the context of the non est factum issue). In the circumstances, it seemed to me a gross injustice if contributory negligence were not to be taken into account in determining the third defendants` liability to the plaintiff. I could see no injustice to the plaintiff apart from the anxiety and false hope factors (to which undue importance should not be attached), particularly since no new evidence or pleadings would be required. The plaintiff`s counsel was granted leave to make a further written submission, but no other party (including counsel for the third defendants) felt it necessary to make any further submissions. There was therefore no additional pressure on the courts by allowing the amendment.
I now have to determine the extent of the legal assistant`s negligence. From the findings I have earlier made on the question of non est factum, it is inevitable that there must be some apportionment of liability between the plaintiff and the third defendants. The plaintiff has failed in her claim of non est factum because I have found that she was careless. I appreciate that 
 Gallie v Lee 
 1 specifically disavowed any link between carelessness in non est factum and negligence in tort. Nonetheless, it is easy to view the plaintiff`s conduct as fulfilling the requirements of contributory negligence in this case. 
 Clerk & Lindsell 
 states (at para 10-166): 
 
... damages are to be apportioned according to the proportions in which the parties are responsible for the damage taking into account both causation and blameworthiness, and the amount recoverable must be reduced `to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant`s share in the responsibility for the damage`. [These words also appear in s 3(1) of our Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54).] Before any apportionment can be made it must first be ascertained whether the plaintiff`s fault has been one of the causes of the damage and, once this condition has been satisfied, the damages must then be apportioned according to the parties` share of the responsibility.
 
 
 
On the one hand, the legal assistant, in signing pp 10 and 11 of the mortgage without having seen the plaintiff and her husband, ought to have appreciated the risk of fraud, notwithstanding the closeness of his relationship with Hoh Weng Cheong, because the main reason for having solicitors witness and attest executants` signatures is to guard against fraud. Since he had voluntarily accepted the responsibility of acting as solicitor for the plaintiff and her husband, it was incumbent on him to ensure that they understood the nature and contents of the document they were to sign. If he failed to discharge that duty, it must have been foreseeable that one or both of their signatures could have been forged or obtained without due appreciation of the contents, particularly when they were obtaining no benefit from the transaction. And if forgery or uninformed signing occurred, then clearly his clients would be in exactly the same position as the plaintiff now stands, making exactly the claim which she now makes.
On the other hand, the plaintiff is clearly the part author of her own misfortune. I have already set out the reasons why she was careless in executing the mortgage, albeit unknowingly. The question is to what extent her own carelessness should reduce her own entitlement to damages from the third defendants.
Although the issue of contributory negligence as between clients and their professional advisers is not frequently raised, there are precedents for such apportionment. (See 
 Jackson and Powell on Professional Negligence 
 (3rd Ed, 1992) para 4-73 and cases there cited. In 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 ,22 the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that the widow, who failed to take her solicitor`s recommendation to seek independent advice and to make her own inquiries into her son`s financial position, was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50%.) I have not been able to discover any precedent for apportionment of responsibility in non est factum cases. Indeed, there does not appear to be a precedent for an action brought by a signatory who has unsuccessfully pleaded non est factum against a solicitor claiming damages for negligence. Nonetheless, applying the basic principles which I have set out above, it is clear that there must be an apportionment of liability.
As Richardson J said in 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 22 (at p 572): 
 
Whether or not a plaintiff has been contributorily negligent is a practical question to be decided on common sense principles. In essence, contributory negligence connotes failure on the part of the person suffering damage to take reasonable care of himself (or herself) in his (or her) own interests.
 
 
 
This point is underlined by 
 Salmond and Heuston 
 (at p 507) who point out that the question of contributory negligence does not depend on any breach of duty as between the plaintiff and the defendant. In 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ltd 
 ,31 Denning LJ said (at p 326): 
 
Whilst causation is the decisive factor in determining whether there should be a reduced amount payable to the plaintiff, nevertheless, the amount of the reduction does not depend solely on the degree of causation. The amount of the reduction is such an amount as may be found by the court to be `just and equitable`, having regard to the claimant`s `share in the responsibility` for the damage. This involves a consideration, not only of the causative potency of a particular factor, but also of its blameworthiness.
 
 
 
Both the plaintiff and the legal assistant have clearly acted carelessly, and their joint carelessness has resulted in the loss which is the subject of this claim. I can only echo the words of Richardson J in 
 Mouat v Clark Boyce 
 22 (at p 573): 
 
Weighing as best I can their respective shares in the responsibility for the loss which ensued I cannot with confidence attribute a greater share to one than to the other, ...
 
 
 
I therefore apportion liability in equal shares between the plaintiff and the third defendants as the employers of the negligent legal assistant.
As the property has not yet been foreclosed or sold by OCBC, the exact loss suffered by the plaintiff has yet to be determined. On the assumption that Sourgrapes and its directors are unable to pay the outstanding amount owed by Sourgrapes to OCBC, the plaintiff will be liable to pay OCBC the outstanding amount due. If she is able to pay off OCBC without losing her house then her loss will be the amount she has paid to OCBC. If, however, she is unable to pay OCBC, which then exercises its rights as mortgagee to sell the property (that being the more likely course of action than foreclosure), then the measure of her loss should theoretically be the difference between: (a) the open market value of the house at the time of the mortgagee sale, that being the date when she suffered the damage arising from the tort (and for this purpose the value must be taken on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis, and not the forced sale value likely to be realized on a mortgagee sale); and (b) the balance of the proceeds of sale paid to her by OCBC after discharging the indebtedness of Sourgrapes and the expenses of sale. However, regard may also have to be given to the need for her to mitigate her loss by exercising her claims for damages or indemnity against the first defendant, and for contribution against her co-guarantors, assuming that they were worth suing at the material time. There is also the question whether she should have allowed OCBC to sell the property earlier, either to realize a higher price than can now be obtained, or to stop interest accruing on Sourgrapes` account. All of this will have to be determined by the registrar on an assessment of damages.
 Fourth party claim
The third defendants of course have a claim for indemnity or damages against the legal assistant based on his breach of an implied term of his contract of employment that he would exercise reasonable skill and knowledge, care and diligence; alternatively, for the tort of negligence. The legal assistant merely filed what was effectively an extended general traverse, denying all allegations of negligence and breach of contract, but advancing no positive defence. This defence can be disposed of quickly. I have already found that the legal assistant`s conduct was negligent vis-a-vis the plaintiff. It follows that it was also negligent vis-a-vis the third defendants, and in breach of his implied obligations under his contract of employment. The third defendants are entitled to damages against him arising from his breach of contract and duty (see 
Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd
 
[1957] AC 555
[1957] 1 All ER 125
[1957] 2 WLR 158
 ). The third defendants will therefore be entitled to full indemnity from the legal assistant.
This has been a sorry tale to hear, with all parties to a greater or lesser extent being victims of the fraud of the true culprits, who have not been sued. It is distressing that the parties who are guilty of only negligence, and who can ill afford the loss, have had to bear it in this case. For the parties in this case, a bitter lesson will have been learnt. It is perhaps futile to hope that doting mothers will in future take more care in signing documents presented to them by their children, but I certainly hope that members of the legal profession will read, mark and digest this judgment so that they may understand the perils of witnessing or attesting the signature of someone who has not signed or appeared before them.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal from a decision of Tan Teow Yeow JC, whereby he dismissed a district court appeal by the appellant, who had claimed damages for personal injuries sustained when he was hit by an SBS bus driven by the first respondent as servant and agent of the second respondent.
The accident happened on 9 April 1984 at the traffic light-controlled junction of Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 and Avenue 6. The appellant, who was 64 years old, was crossing, or attempting to cross, the pedestrian crossing across the mouth of Avenue 6 on the south side of Avenue 3. The bus driven by the first respondent was proceeding on Avenue 6 from the city northwards towards Yio Chu Kang. The appellant was crossing or attempting to cross the pedestrian crossing from the west side of Avenue 6 to the east side.
Avenue 6 was a dual carriageway, with three traffic lanes on either side of the road divider. The lane on the west side of Avenue 6 was for traffic proceeding straight or turning left. The middle lane was for traffic proceeding straight or turning right. The extreme right lane next to the road divider was for traffic turning right only. At the time of the accident, the bus driven by the first respondent was travelling in the extreme right lane.
The appellant gave evidence that at the time he started to cross the road, vehicles on the first two lanes had come to a full stop. This is not disputed. The appellant said that the green man of the traffic lights was showing to him when he was crossing. But this was disputed on behalf of the first respondent, and the district judge found on the evidence of the traffic lights expert that what the appellant said could not be true. In fact, the appellant started crossing when the red man had come on. The learned judicial commissioner agreed with this finding. We ourselves found no ground to say that the district judge was wrong.
There is no dispute, however, that at the time when the appellant was crossing the road, the right turning light for vehicles in the first respondent`s lane was showing green allowing vehicles in this lane to enter the junction and to turn right.
The first respondent said that when he was approaching the junction he was going at 35 to 42kmph. He was travelling in the right lane as he intended to make a right turn into Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. As he was about 200ft from the junction, he saw that the traffic lights were green in his favour. When he came nearer to the junction, the traffic lights turned red but the green arrow allowing traffic to turn right into Avenue 3 came on. He gave the distance between him and the junction at this point of time as about 100ft. He continued to approach the junction. It was only when he was about 10 to 12ft from the stop line across the junction that he saw the appellant walking on the crossing. He sounded the horn and applied the brakes, but he could not avoid the accident. The left corner of the front bumper hit the appellant.
The first respondent said that he was unable to see the appellant until he was about 12ft from the stop line as his view was blocked by vehicles in the first two lanes, the lanes to his left, including two Daihatsu lorries. He was thus unable to see the whole of the pedestrian crossing.
The appellant raised the question of the possible breach of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossing) Rules 1982 before the learned judicial commissioner by leave. It had not been raised before the district judge. The appellant relied on the English House of Lords case of 
 London Passenger Transport Board v Upson & Anor 
 ,1 a case dealing with the interpretation and application of the corresponding provisions of the UK Pedestrian Crossing Places (Traffic) Regulations 1941. The relevant parts of the UK regulations provided as follows: 
 
 
(3) The driver of every vehicle approaching a crossing shall, unless he can see that there is no foot passenger thereon, proceed at such a speed as to be able, if necessary, to stop before reaching such crossing. 
 
(4) The driver of every vehicle at or approaching a crossing where traffic is not for the time being controlled by a police constable or by light signals shall allow free and uninterrupted passage to any foot passenger who is on the carriageway at such crossing, and every such foot passenger shall have precedence over all vehicular traffic at such crossing. 
 
(5) The driver of every vehicle at or approaching a crossing at a road intersection where traffic is for the time being controlled by a police constable or by light signals shall allow free and uninterrupted passage to every foot passenger who has started to go over the crossing before the driver receives a signal that he may proceed over the crossing.
  
 
 
 
 Application of the rules
 
In the 
 Upson 
 case,1 the facts, briefly, were as follows. The plaintiff was crossing Baker Street at its junction with Blandford Street. She was using a light controlled pedestrian crossing, but against the light. A taxi, which had been left with its wheels on the crossing, blocked her view of on-coming traffic on Baker Street. A bus was coming down Baker Street. The driver`s view of her was similarly blocked by the taxi. The plaintiff was knocked down, and she sued the driver and his employers the London Passenger Transport Board.
All the members of the House of Lords were of the opinion that the driver, since his view of the pedestrian crossing was blocked by the taxi on the crossing, should have proceeded at such a speed as to be able to pull up. They were unanimously of the view that in failing to do so, the driver was guilty of a breach of reg 3. They, however, upheld the finding of 50% contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Lord Wright said (at p 68): 
 
The taxicab unlawfully drawn up on the crossing prevented the driver from seeing that there was no foot passenger on it. Hence he was bound to proceed at a pace which would enable him, if necessary, to stop before reaching the crossing. The driver was, indeed, proceeding at a reasonable rate apart from the regulation, but he was, in fact, unable to stop before reaching the crossing and, in consequence, he hit and injured the respondent.
 
 
 
Lord Porter attempted to define what was a reasonable approach speed as follows: 
 
I think the true position is that the motorist must be able to see whether the crossing is clear or not up to the time when, going at the speed he is going, provided it is a reasonable speed, he would still be able to stop before reaching the crossing. ... if I may adopt the method of exposition of MacKinnon LJ [in the 
 Chisholm v London Passenger Transport Board
 [1938] 4 All ER 850], if a motorist proceeding at x miles per hour, whatever that speed may be, provided it is a reasonable speed, can stop in y yards, he must see that the crossing is clear until he has approached to a stop within that distance. If he does not or cannot do so, he has committed an offence against the regulations. But he has not broken them if someone steps on the crossing after he has reached such a spot.
 
 
 
Lord Du Parcq preferred to be less mathematical. He said (at pp 73-74): 
 
I must respectfully suggest to your Lordships that, notwithstanding the air of mathematical accuracy which the algebraical symbols employed lend to this argument, it is fallacious in so far as it overlooks the fact that no speed is reasonable which is not adjusted to the circumstances of the moment, including the fact that the driver is approaching a pedestrian crossing and may have to pull up quickly and within a very short distance.
 
 
 
Lord Wright dealt with the question of the plaintiff`s contributory negligence thus: 
 
She was, indeed, herself negligent in coming out beyond the taxicab without sufficiently considering the green light and the approaching traffic. ... That was her contributory negligence. But the driver`s failure to obey reg 3 caused, or contributed to, the accident. It was not adeemed by the miscalculation on the part of the respondent; that only goes here to reduce the amount of her recovery ...
 
 
 
 
 Approach of the court below
 
In the instant case, the learned judicial commissioner refused to follow the 
 Upson 
 case.1 He thought it was distinguishable. He said: 
 
In London in 1949, jaywalking was not an offence and there was nothing to prevent a pedestrian from crossing a road even though the pedestrian crossing light was against him. In Singapore, a pedestrian who crosses the road when the pedestrian crossing light is against him commits an offence. In Singapore, a driver has a right to presume that his way is clear when the traffic light is in his favour, and the pedestrian crossing light is red. To rule otherwise would be to impose a strict liability on all motorists at controlled junctions. The first respondent in this case had exercised due care by doing all he could to prevent the accident in the circumstances. I therefore found that the respondent was not negligent.
 
 
 
 
 The relevant rules
 
The relevant rules of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian Crossings) Rules 1982 (`the Rules`) of Singapore are as follows: 
 
 
(5) The driver of every vehicle approaching a pedestrian crossing shall, unless he can see that there is no pedestrian thereon, proceed at such speed as will enable him to stop his vehicle before reaching the crossing. 
 
(6) The driver of every vehicle at, or approaching, a pedestrian crossing where traffic is not for the time being controlled by a police officer or by light signals shall allow free and uninterrupted passage to any pedestrian who is either crossing or is starting to cross a road and every pedestrian shall have precedence over all vehicular traffic at such crossing. 
 
(7) Wherever there is a pedestrian crossing at a road inter-section or junction where traffic is controlled by a police officer or by light signals, every pedestrian who is about to enter or has entered such crossing shall be permitted free and uninterrupted passage over the crossing by all drivers of vehicles who are approaching the crossing notwithstanding that such drivers may have already received a signal to proceed either from the light signals or the police officer, as the case may be.
  
 
 
With one significant difference in r 7 (of which more below), rr 5, 6 and 7 are largely framed in similar terms to regs 3, 4 and 5 of the UK regulations.
It may be assumed that the Singapore rules were made with full knowledge of the decision of the 
 Upson 
 case1 and its effect. The House of Lords` decision in the 
 Upson 
 case1 and their Lordships` well considered views in that case are of assistance in the resolution of the issues before us.
As a matter of construction, the position therefore is this. Rule 5 applies to both controlled and uncontrolled junctions. By `controlled`, we mean control either by light signals or police officers, as the rules envisage control by either means.
For the sake of brevity, in the discussions in the following paragraphs, we shall only refer to control by light signals. Our comments apply, of course, to crossings which for the time being are controlled by a police officer.
Rule 5 lays down the general requirement applicable, as we say, to both controlled and uncontrolled crossings. It in terms requires the driver of a vehicle approaching any pedestrian crossing, whether controlled or not, to approach it at such a speed as will enable him to stop his vehicle before reaching the crossing, unless he can see that there is no one on the crossing.
Rule 6 applies to uncontrolled crossings. It accords precedence to a pedestrian who is either crossing or is starting to cross the road. Rule 7 applies to controlled crossings. It accords precedence to a pedestrian who is about to enter or has entered the crossings, even if the driver has received a signal to proceed.
 Rule 7
Rule 7 differs from the UK reg 5 in this respect. Whereas reg 5 gives precedence to a pedestrian `who has started to go over the crossing before the driver receives a signal that he may proceed`, r 7, on the other hand, gives precedence to a pedestrian `who is about to enter or has entered such crossing` notwithstanding that the driver `may have already received a signal to proceed.`
In the 
 Upson 
 case,1 Lord Porter (at p 64C) made the following comment on reg 5: 
 
In considering its application to this case, reg 5 is, perhaps, most material in its negative implications, ie it enacts that uninterrupted passage is to be allowed to everyone who has started to go over the crossing before the light turns green, and, inferentially, declares that such passage need not be given once the light has turned green. But I do not think that reg 5 overrides reg 3 even at a controlled crossing, ...
 
 
 
The wording of r 7 removes altogether the `negative implications` spoken of by Lord Porter. The underlying reason for this formulation of r 7 must be the assumption that there will be the occasional individuals who, because of one reason or another, are unable to complete the crossing within the time allowed, particularly if they begin the crossing towards the end of the light cycle, and particularly if they are old, infirm or plain slow. There will also be the occasional individuals who are on the crossing when they are not supposed to be there, through accident, inadvertence or carelessness.
As it removes the `negative implications` spoken of by Lord Porter, the wording of r 7 removes the necessity of considering at what point of time a pedestrian steps on to the crossing for the purpose of considering the driver`s duty under the rule.
 Driver`s duty at pedestrian crossings
It is incumbent upon the driver of a vehicle to approach any pedestrian crossing in the manner required by r 5 and to keep a proper lookout to see that there are no pedestrians on it or about to enter it.
At controlled crossings, a driver is not exonerated from his duty under r 5 and r 7 by the fact that the pedestrian started crossing when the light was against the pedestrian. It is not the driver`s concern whether the pedestrian has gone against the light in getting on to the crossing. Indeed, at controlled junctions, the driver is not intended to be guided by the light signals that regulate the pedestrian traffic. He is often not in the best position to see those signals.
Thus, while the efficient and proper functioning of pedestrian crossings assume that all pedestrians using them will follow any signal governing their movements, and indeed, as will be seen in a moment, rules are enacted to secure this, the duty of drivers of vehicles under r 5 or r 7 is not dependent on or subject to the pedestrians obeying such signals. Such a construction would unjustifiably import words into the rules.
We therefore respectfully disagree with the learned judicial commissioner in so far as he held that the first respondent had the right to assume that his way was clear when the traffic lights were in his favour and the pedestrian crossing light was red. The implication that the driver only needs to follow the lights regulating his vehicle movement and does not need to look out for persons who might be on the pedestrian crossing, is not supported by the wording of r 5 or r 7. Indeed it goes against it.
 `Jaywalking an offence` point: the pedestrian`s duty
Rule 3(3) of the Rules provides as follows: 
 
Where a pedestrian crossing is designated by two parallel yellow lines drawn across a road at a junction or an intersection, a pedestrian shall cross parallel with the flow of vehicular traffic and where a pedestrian crossing is designated by a signalised traffic sign, a pedestrian shall only cross when the green man in the signalised traffic sign is illuminated.
 
 
 
Rule 12 also provides that no pedestrian shall remain on the crossing longer than is necessary for the purpose of making the crossing.
The Rules themselves do not create offences for their contraventions. However, under a general provision in s 131(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276)(`the Act`), a contravention of rules made under the Act is an offence attracting, in the case of a first offence, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months and in the case of a second or subsequent offence a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.
There are also various provisions in the Highway Code (`the Code`) published in pursuance of s 112. This Code includes various provisions dealing with the use of pedestrian crossings. In particular, para 22 says: 
 
At a light controlled crossing wait on the footway until the traffic, in front of which you intend to cross, has come to a standstill.
 
 
 
Paragraph 23 of the Code says: 
 
If traffic lights have a `cross` signal or a `green man` signal, do not cross until the signal appears. If there are no pedestrian signals, cross only with the green light.
 
 
 
It is provided in s 112 of the Act that a failure on the part of any person to observe any provisions of the Code shall not of itself render that person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind, but any such failure may, in any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, be relied upon as tending to establish or to negative any liability in question in those proceedings.
Lord Uthwatt in the 
 Upson 
 case1 said: 
 
A driver is not ... bound to anticipate folly in all its forms, but he is not ... entitled to put out of consideration the teachings of experience as to the form those follies commonly take.
 
 
 
This was said in the context of the behaviour of pedestrians in London, where it was not an offence for a pedestrian to cross a road junction against the lights. However, the fact that such a behaviour has been made an offence here does not mean that such behaviour has been eliminated, although its incidence has no doubt been much reduced. In our view the driver of a vehicle is not entitled to put out of consideration altogether the possibility of the presence of persons on a pedestrian crossing even when the light is in favour of the driver. Rule 7 contemplates exactly this sort of possibility.
We therefore respectfully disagree with the learned judicial commissioner in the rather decisive weight he attached to the fact that it is an offence for a pedestrian to cross a light-controlled pedestrian crossing when the light is against him. It is our view that a driver of a vehicle is not relieved of his duty under rr 5 and 7 by the fact that the pedestrian on his path has committed an offence.
 Contributory negligence
However, the fact that it is an offence for a pedestrian to cross a controlled crossing against light signals, in our view, does make a difference in this way. The fact that it is an offence means that drivers of vehicles in general have less reason to anticipate such occurrences, although, as we pointed out earlier, such occurrences cannot in reality be ruled out altogether. For the pedestrian, it also means that the danger inherent in such behaviour is that much greater. A person who crosses a light-controlled crossing in disobedience of a light signal applicable to him thus assumes a high degree of contributory negligence.
 Traffic paralysis argument
It is said on behalf of the first respondent that the Singapore of the 1990`s is different from the London of 1949. It is said that imposing a duty on the driver of a vehicle in the way we have proposed would lead to massive traffic congestions and a chaotic situation, as motorists would be required to slow down or stop at every junction even though the lights might be in their favour. Such anxieties are not new. They were adverted to in the 
 Upson 
 case.1
However, the pedestrian crossing rules have been devised to enable pedestrians and motorized vehicles to co-exist on our ever increasingly congested roads. While traffic has to move efficiently, the rules also seek to give protection to pedestrians using crossings. The courts have to try their best to give these rules the effect intended. The combined operation of the criminal law and the rule of contributory negligence would go a little way to ameliorate these anxieties.
 Conclusion
On the facts, and on the view we take as to the construction of rr 5 and 7 of the Rules, we are of the view that the first respondent was in breach of these two rules.
The first respondent said that he was travelling at 35 to 42kmph. There is no indication that he slowed down at all when approaching the junction, even though his view of the pedestrian crossing was partially blocked. He clearly dismissed totally the possibility of anyone being on the crossing.
The appellant, on the other hand, should not have gone on the crossing against the lights. He must have been encouraged to start the crossing when he saw the vehicles in the lanes nearer to him come to a stop. The first respondent could not see him until he was about 10 to 12ft away. In attempting to cross the road in this manner, the appellant was quite heedless of his own safety.
We think the appellant was more to blame for the accident than was the first respondent. We would apportion blame in the proportion of 70% to 30% in favour of the first respondent.
We allow the appeal. We order that judgment be entered for the appellant for damages to be assessed in the district court in the proportion indicated. The appellant shall have his costs here and in the High Court, but the order for costs against him in the district court shall remain undisturbed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The accused Koh Aik Siew was tried in the High Court on the following charge under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`): 
 
You, Koh Aik Siew, are charged that you on or about 29 April 1990, between 8.20pm and 9.06pm in Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 676.8g of diamorphine which was in your possession at the bedroom of premises #03-02, Prince Apartment,
 
 
 
34 Jalan Datoh, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) committed an offence under s 5(a) and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
 
 The undisputed facts
 
Two officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), Narcotics Officers Ting Ming Ling (`NO Ting`) and Chan King Onn (`NO Chan`), had been observing the activities of the accused since early January 1990. They had observed the accused driving his car, licence plate number EW321T, to and from Block 79 Lorong Limau (`Block 79`) and had seen it parked at the foot of Prince Apartment at Jalan Datoh (`Prince Apartment`). On 28 April 1990, they observed the accused at flat #07-165 of Block 79.
On 29 April 1990 at about 7pm, NO Ting and NO Chan went to Block 77 Lorong Limau to keep a lookout for the accused`s car. At about 8pm they were joined by NO Ravinder Singh. At 8.20pm, they spotted vehicle EW321T moving towards Block 79 and NO Ting instructed NO Ravinder Singh to proceed to flat #07-165 of Block 79 to keep watch. NO Ting and NO Chan then went to the ground floor of Block 79. At about 8.35pm, NO Ravinder Singh came and told NO Ting and NO Chan that the accused was leaving flat #07-165. The accused was duly arrested when he alighted from the lift. NO Ting seized a key pouch from the right hand of the accused. On being questioned, the accused replied in Hokkien that he had been having a bath at his friend`s flat upstairs. The accused confirmed that vehicle EW321T was his car. NO Ting opened the right side door of vehicle EW321T with one of the keys from the key pouch seized from the accused. A brief search of the car did not turn up anything incriminating.
The three officers then escorted the accused to the lift lobby of Block 79.
NO Chan asked the accused in Hokkien for the unit number of his friend`s flat and the accused replied that it was `#07-165`. The party proceeded to flat #07-165 and NO Ting opened the front door with keys from the key pouch seized from the accused. On entering the flat, NO Ting directed the other two officers to conduct a search but, again, nothing incriminating was found.
At 9pm the officers left the flat with the accused and proceeded to Prince Apartment in the car belonging to the accused. They arrived at Prince Apartment at 9.05pm. The accused, on being questioned, told the officers that he was staying in flat #03-02 and led them to the flat. The accused pointed out a key from the bunch of keys in the key pouch and NO Ting opened the front door of flat #03-02 with this key.
The accused led NO Ting and NO Chan to a bedroom and pointed to a key in the key pouch with which NO Ting opened the bedroom door. After entering the bedroom NO Ting instructed NO Chan to check the wardrobes in the room.
NO Chan recovered four bags from the wardrobe beside the bed: a red travelling bag, a brown travelling bag, an `OG` shopping bag and a dark brown briefcase. There were 17 packages wrapped in newspaper in the brown travelling bag and two similar packages each in the red travelling bag and the `OG` shopping bag. The dark brown briefcase was locked with a combination lock and, on being asked by NO Chan, the accused supplied the numbers to the lock which NO Chan used to open the briefcase. Inside were three plastic packages containing brown granular substances, a daching and some empty plastic bags. The contents of all the packages were later found to be diamorphine. NO Ting recovered from another wardrobe near the television set an electric plastic sealing machine, a weighing scale, an electronic weighing scale, a packet of plastic bags and cash of $8,000 and RM690 and some cheques. Two books were also recovered but these were subsequently returned to the accused`s family.
NO Ting`s superior officer, Senior Narcotics Officer Chow Toong Chee (`SNO Chow`), arrived at the scene at 9.40pm and was briefed by NO Ting who introduced the accused to him. The accused was escorted to the CNB office in Geylang Police Station and arrived at 12.45am. At 2.30am SNO Chow instructed NO Ravinder Singh, NO Peh Beng Kiat (`NO Peh`) and another officer to escort the accused to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for a check-up. The party arrived at the hospital at 2.40am and the accused was examined by the medical officer on duty. They returned to the CNB office at 4.10am.
At about 4.40am, the accused was brought to SNO Chow`s office, a small room in the CNB general office. Another officer, SNO Chew Khai Chow, and an interpreter, Wu Nan Yong (`Wu`), went into the room together with him. The charge was read out to the accused in English by SNO Chow and interpreted by Wu into Hokkien. Wu then informed the accused that trafficking meant the sale and purchase of drugs, that he faced the death penalty if he was convicted, and that under s 17 of the Act he was presumed to be trafficking in the diamorphine because he was in possession of more than two grammes of it. The notice of warning was also read to the accused in English and interpreted in Hokkien, and the accused admitted that he understood it. The accused then gave a cautioned statement in Hokkien under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the CPC`) which was interpreted by Wu and written down in English by SNO Chew (`the cautioned statement`). The statement was: `The heroin was passed on to me by a Malaysian. I kept the heroin with me. That is all.`
 The disputed facts
There were two main disputes on the facts. The first concerned statements allegedly made by the accused to certain CNB officers during the course of the arrest and the seizure of the diamorphine. The second involved statements made to the accused by certain CNB officers at the Geylang Police Station and at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital which allegedly induced the accused to make the cautioned statement.
 Statements made by the accused
The prosecution adduced evidence to show that the accused made certain statements to NO Ting at the flat #07-165 of Block 79. NO Ting gave evidence that, after the search of the flat #07-165 by NOs Chan and Ravinder Singh failed to produce any drugs, he asked the accused whether there were any drugs in Prince Apartment. The accused replied that he wished to co-operate with the government because of his involvement with drugs. The accused asked to be placed under criminal law detention instead of being hanged. He admitted that he had 20lb of heroin at Prince Apartment. NO Ting asked the accused whether anyone else had the keys to the place where he kept the drugs and the accused replied in the negative. This conversation was recorded by NO Ting in his notebook when he returned to the office and was transcribed into his pocket diary a day or two later. NOs Chan and Ravinder Singh gave evidence that NO Ting was talking to the accused while they were searching apartment #07-165.
According to the prosecution, the accused also made certain statements to NO Ting while in the bedroom at Prince Apartment where the diamorphine was recovered. NO Ting and NO Chan gave evidence that, when they first entered the room with the accused, NO Ting asked the accused where the drugs were kept. The accused turned his head towards the wardrobe beside the bed and replied in Hokkien, `On top.` After NO Chan recovered all the diamorphine from the wardrobe, NO Ting asked the accused if he knew how much heroin he had with him. The accused replied that he did not know and that he had obtained it from a Malaysian. NO Ting asked the accused how much he had paid for the heroin and the accused said in Hokkien that he had paid RM5,000 for one pound. NO Ting then asked the accused what he did with the heroin and the accused replied in Hokkien that he disposed of it by selling it. The accused further asked NO Ting if the latter really thought that he (the accused) could consume all the heroin himself. This conversation was recorded by both NOs Ting and Chan after the operation and transcribed into their pocket diaries later.
The accused allegedly had a third conversation with SNO Chow. This took place after SNO Chow arrived at Prince Apartment and the accused was introduced to him by NO Ting. SNO Chow asked the accused what he had and the accused replied that he had over 20lb of heroin. The accused told SNO Chow that he had been very co-operative and he had surrendered the drugs to the officers. The accused further said that he did not want to make things difficult for them and asked SNO Chow to check with the officers whether or not he had been co-operative earlier on. The accused then told SNO Chow that he did not wish to be hanged but would rather face criminal law detention for 12 years. SNO Chow recorded this conversation on a piece of paper and transcribed it in his pocket diary two or three days later. NO Chan also recorded this conversation in the same way. NO Ting gave evidence that he heard this conversation. The accounts given by all three men were substantially similar. SNO Chow also gave evidence that about ten minutes later he asked the accused whether anyone else had the key to the room and the accused replied that no one else had the key.
The accused denied that he had made any of the above statements. He gave evidence that, after the officers had searched flat #07-165 of Block 79, NO Ting questioned him as to where he lived and he replied that he lived in Prince Apartment. NO Ting then asked him to bring the officers there and this was what he did. The accused denied that there was any mention of drugs by the officers or that he made any incriminating statements as alleged by the prosecution.
The accused similarly denied that he showed or indicated to NOs Ting and Chan where the drugs were in his bedroom in Prince Apartment, or that there was a conversation between him and NO Ting in the room after the drugs were recovered. According to the accused, after the drugs were recovered, he was asked by NO Ting to whom the drugs belonged and he replied that he did not know. There were no other questions from NO Ting after this, and he did not make any other statements.
The accused also denied that there was a conversation between him and SNO Chow at Prince Apartment. He said that he was merely introduced to SNO Chow and that SNO Chow did not speak to him at all.
The accused said that he was a moneylender and that his partner in moneylending was one Koh Kim Leng, who resided at flat #07-165 of Block 79 with his wife. He was on very good terms with the Kohs and would go to their flat to sleep, bathe and change his clothes. The accused also rented a bedroom of a flat in Prince Apartment. The accused did the moneylending accounts and kept the account books in this room. On some occasions, Koh Kim Leng would come to the room to look over the accounts.
The accused gave evidence that he did not know anything about how the drugs came to be in his bedroom and that he had not previously opened the top portion of the wardrobe where the drugs were found. He had never seen the travelling bags and the `OG` shopping bag before, and did not know to whom they belonged. He admitted that the briefcase was his but said that he had lent it to a Malaysian friend whom he knew by the nickname of Pui Kiah. When the packages of diamorphine were recovered from the briefcase, he had thought to himself that they must have been put there by Pui Kiah, since he had lent the briefcase to him. The evidence of the accused was that Pui Kiah was a procurer who often came to Singapore with his lady associates and that Pui Kiah kept his girls` passports and bags containing their clothing in the bedroom in Prince Apartment to save hotel expenses. Pui Kiah had borrowed the briefcase from the accused to keep his girls` passports. According to the accused, Pui Kiah would come to the bedroom in the morning when the other occupants of the flat were sleeping to avoid detection, as the accused was not supposed to bring guests to the flat. The accused had duplicated the keys to the main door and the bedroom door of the flat in Prince Apartment and had given them to Pui Kiah. However, the accused did not know Pui Kiah`s full name, surname, address or telephone number. He only knew that Pui Kiah could be found in some eating houses in the Sentosa Complex in Johor Bahru and was known as `Ah Seong` in Malaysia.
The accused gave evidence that he had been staying in hotels from 27 April to 29 April when he was arrested, and this was supported by documentary evidence from the respective hotels. During this period he never went back to Prince Apartment. The accused also claimed that during this period he was paged twice by Pui Kiah and he returned the call to a local telephone number. Pui Kiah told the accused that he was in Singapore. However, the accused admitted in cross-examination that he never mentioned Pui Kiah to any CNB officer on the day he was arrested (29 April) or the day after (30 April).
 Trial-within-a-trial
The defence alleged that there were three acts of inducement which rendered the cautioned statement of the accused inadmissible under s 122(6) of the CPC. As to the first alleged act of inducement, the accused gave evidence that, when he was first brought into the CNB general office from Prince Apartment, some officers came and said that he was in serious trouble and that he had no hope unless he admitted that someone had left the heroin with him. The accused said that he was in a confused state of mind when he heard that and was unable to say who spoke the words or whether they were directed at him. NO Peh, one of the officers in the general office at the material time, denied that the officers said anything among themselves or to the accused.
The second alleged act of inducement was by NO Peh at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The accused claimed that, while he was waiting for the doctor, NO Peh sat beside him and asked him whether he had committed the offence. The accused replied that he had not. NO Peh then told him that if he was found to be in possession of such a large quantity of heroin he could face the death penalty, but that if he said that the heroin had been left with him by a Malaysian he would have a `50/50 chance` of escaping the penalty. NO Peh then spoke to the accused about other matters such as whether he was married and had children. The whole incident was denied by NO Peh who claimed that no such conversation took place. This evidence was corroborated by the evidence of NO Ravinder Singh, who was seated behind the accused during the material time.
The third act of inducement allegedly took place just before the accused made the cautioned statement to SNO Chew. The accused gave evidence that he begged SNO Chew to charge him for possession or to detain him under criminal law detention. SNO Chew did not answer but told the accused to sign and said that the case would be a 50/50 case. The accused made the cautioned statement to SNO Chew after this. The incident was denied by SNO Chew. The interpreter, Wu, also denied that there had been any such incident.
 The decision of the High Court
In his judgment, the trial judge considered the evidence adduced during the voir dire. He stated that an accused who is alleged to have made a cautioned statement needs to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not make it voluntarily for the statement to be rendered inadmissible. He rejected the allegations made by the accused and accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. He thus found that the accused had not discharged his burden of proof and admitted the cautioned statement in evidence.
With all due respect, we must say that the trial judge misdirected himself in considering the evidence adduced during the voir dire, because it is still for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily. The trial judge therefore applied the wrong burden of proof, and, as we cannot be at all certain what the result would have been had he proceeded correctly, we must state that the statement was wrongly admitted and must be excluded. Notwithstanding that the statement was wrongly admitted, however, this would not be sufficient ground to justify allowing this appeal if, as was the case here, there was sufficient other evidence to justify the conviction: see Evidence Act (Cap 97) s 169. Here the statement was merely to the effect that a Malaysian had passed the heroin to him and he had kept it with him. This tended to show that he had the drug in his possession.
In this case, having reviewed all the prosecution evidence, the trial judge reasoned that as it was undisputed that only the accused had the keys to the bedroom in Prince Apartment, a rebuttable presumption of possession arose under s 18(1)(c) of the Act, quite independently of the cautioned statement. He then pointed out that when possession was established, a rebuttable presumption of trafficking would arise under s 17(c) of the Act as amended on 15 February 1990. Therefore, when the prosecution closed its case, the prosecution had made out a case which if unrebutted would warrant the conviction of the accused. Accordingly, he called on the accused to enter on his defence.
After examining the defence case, the trial judge observed several shortcomings. He pointed out that there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the accused. The evidence about Pui Kiah was doubtful, as the accused did not satisfactorily explain why he did not tell the officers about Pui Kiah earlier and there was a paucity of information about Pui Kiah. Accordingly, he rejected the evidence on Pui Kiah. He was also not persuaded that the accused did not make the oral statements attributed to him by the CNB officers and which the accused denied making. He therefore found that there was sufficient direct evidence that the diamorphine recovered was in the possession of the accused. Having reviewed the evidence and the proceedings in the High Court, we are in complete agreement with all these findings of the trial judge.
Before us in this court counsel for the appellant confined himself to a simple submission based on the presumption concerning trafficking under the amended s 17 of the Act which came into effect on 15 February 1990. He conceded that the present s 17 when invoked presumes that the offence of trafficking has been constituted, in that both mens rea and actus reus are presumed, but he contended that the presumption can be rebutted by showing the absence of either actus reus or mens rea. Actus reus itself is specifically defined in s 2 of the Act by which `trafficking` means - 
 
 
(a) to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or 
 
(b) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a)
  
 
 
Accordingly counsel for the appellant contended that in the present case the actus reus had been effectively rebutted. The evidence mainly of the prosecution`s own witnesses showed that between 8.20pm and 8.40pm on the evening in question the appellant was at his friend`s flat #07-165 of Block 79 Lorong Limau, having a bath, a claim which was credible and was not challenged. After 8.40pm he was in fact in the custody of the CNB officers. This being the sequence of the appellant`s movements during that critical period `between 8.20pm and 9.06pm` which was stated in the charge, it was impossible for him to perform any of the several overt acts enumerated in the definition of `trafficking` in s 2 of the Act. There was therefore no actus reus and the presumption under s 17 had been successfully rebutted.
While this appears to be a formidable contention on the face of it, it is no longer valid since the decision of this court in 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
  In that case, in which the facts were very similar, this court held that the proper interpretation of s 17 which would be in accord with both the intention and the wording of the section is that s 17 presumes the act of possession to be an act in the course of selling, giving, transporting and so on, or offering to do so, and thus the actus reus of possession is presumed to be the actus reus of trafficking. That being so, an accused person presumed to be in possession and to traffic would have to rebut the presumption by adducing satisfactory evidence that he was not in possession for any of the overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2.
As the act of possession can be presumed to be any of the seven overt acts of trafficking as defined in s 2 of the Act, or an offer to do any of them, this might be unduly burdensome for an accused to show that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of performing any of these acts. In that case, therefore, the court was of the view that the particulars in the charge with respect to the manner of trafficking should be more specifically stated, and the charge should state which of the several overt acts of trafficking in s 2 the accused was charged with. Following the example in that case, this problem would also have been met in the present case if the words `by offering to sell or distribute` should also appear in the charge immediately after the words `to wit,`. As was stated in 
Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 511
  the Court of Criminal Appeal has the power to amend the charge but this power must be exercised judiciously and the possibility of prejudice must be of utmost concern when this court decides on whether to alter a charge. In the present case, the defence had been one of complete denial of the act of possession. There would therefore be no prejudice occasioned by the proposed amendment of the charge as the defence, if believed, would be a complete answer to the charge (see 
PP v Yeoh Teck Chye
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 176
  ). In the present appeal therefore we direct that the charge be amended accordingly.
The large quantity of drugs having been found in his room, the appellant was presumed under s 18(1)(c) to have possession of the drugs, and by the amended s 17 was presumed to traffic in it, unless the presumption was rebutted, which it was not. In addition, paraphernalia associated with the handling of drugs for sale and distribution were also found in the room. The defence of the appellant that he had no knowledge of the drugs and that they belonged to Pui Kiah, was rejected by the trial judge. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

The two appellants were tried and convicted in the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Ramachandran a/l Suppiah and Krishnan a/l Varadan, are charged that on or about 27 July 1984 at about 9am and 11am at Block 131, Tah Ching Road, #09-703, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed murder by causing the death of one Packiria Pillai Krishnasamy, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
They appealed against their conviction. We allowed the appeal of the first appellant and dismissed the appeal of the second appellant. We now give our reasons.
The deceased, an elderly man aged 74 years, lived with his wife Mutthu and daughter Purhanam at their flat at Block 131, Tah Ching Road, #09-703. The deceased was unemployed, Mutthu managed a provision stall at Taman Jurong and Purhanam worked at an electronic factory.
In 1981, the second appellant (who was then about 15 years of age) had for a period of about ten months worked for Mutthu at her provision stall as a stall assistant. Whilst working for her he had also stayed at her flat. Some time in June 1984, the second appellant paid a casual visit to Mutthu`s stall. Mutthu told him she needed a stall assistant and asked him to recommend someone for the job. The second appellant did not have anyone immediately in mind but promised to find a person.
In early July 1984, at about 6pm, the second appellant called at Mutthu`s flat with the first appellant and told Mutthu that the first appellant`s brother was interested in the job. The two appellants then left promising that they would bring the first appellant`s brother to see Mutthu at her stall.
On 26 July 1984, the second appellant telephoned the flat. Mutthu, Purhanam and the deceased all spoke with the second appellant. The gist of the conversation as told to the court by Mutthu and Purhanam was that the first appellant`s brother would be able to come for an interview the next morning with the first appellant but that the second appellant himself would be unable to accompany them as his passport was expiring that day and he had to leave Singapore. As the first appellant did not know how to get to Mutthu`s stall, the second appellant enquired if the first appellant could, instead, take his brother to the flat at 11am the next morning so that the deceased could interview the brother. This was agreed upon.
On 27 July 1984, at about 4.30am and 6.25am respectively, Mutthu and Purhanam left the flat as usual to attend to their respective work. At about 7.50pm that evening when Purhanam returned home from work she saw that the flat had been ransacked and her father was lying naked in a pool of blood at the doorway to her room. She ran out of the flat, met her mother Mutthu who was also returning from her work, and told her what she had seen. Both of them went back into the flat. They called out to the deceased, but there was no response from him. Later, on checking the flat, Purhanam found that a pair of gold earrings (value $140); two lady`s wrist-watches (value $150); 30 imitation precious stones (value $50); a gold ring (value $100); and cash of $1,990 were missing from her cupboard.
Police officers who went to the scene recovered a blood-stained letter-opener from the floor in the hall. The letter-opener was hidden from view by the articles from two drawers which were strewn on the floor. The bloodstains on the letter-opener matched the deceased`s blood. On the patches of blood in the hall near where the deceased was lying the police found shoe imprints. The pattern of these imprints showed that they were from two different shoes. Photographs of the two different imprints were taken.
The next day Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the deceased. Dr Wee testified that the deceased died from haemorrhage due to a stab wound on the neck. This fatal wound was on the front of the neck. Its direction was from front to back, slightly downwards and laterally. It had penetrated to a depth of 8cm and had cut the internal jugular vein. Besides the stab wound on the neck, Dr Wee found a linear superficial scratch on the neck, two stab wounds on the chest (which did not penetrate the chest) and one stab wound at the abdomen which had penetrated into the abdomen to a depth of 5cm.
Dr Wee testified that all these wounds could have been caused by the letter-opener found at the scene; that the fatal injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; that death would have occurred in a matter of minutes after the fatal injury was inflicted and that moderate force would be required to cause that fatal injury.
Dr Wee was of the opinion that all the injuries were inflicted in a frontal assault and, in view of the degree of air embolism in the brain, he opined that the fatal injury was inflicted when the deceased was in a standing position. Dr Wee was also of the opinion that the absence of defensive injuries on the deceased indicated that the first wound inflicted on the deceased was the stab wound on the neck.
On 20 August 1984, at about 3.35pm, the first appellant was arrested by the Malaysian police at Tapah, Perak. He was sent to Singapore on 27 August 1984 and on arrival was arrested by the Singapore police. Shortly after his arrest he was charged under s 302 of the Penal Code for the murder of the deceased and a s 122(6) statement was recorded from him. In the statement he stated: 
 
It is true that on the day in question I was brought to Taman Jurong. I asked the male Indian why he was bringing me there. He said that we could go to his house to steal. The `his` refers to `Party`s` house. I told him that I did not have any experience in this. He told me that I should stand near the lift whilst he would go up. After a while, he came running with blood stains on him. He told me that he had stabbed that man. He invited me to go to the house to look for the knife. I went into the house and searched for it, but I could not find it. He too went with me to the house. Krishnan was holding a plastic bag. He said that since we could not find the knife, we had better flee from the place. We left the said place. I went to my room at Jalan Boon Lay Lama. Krishnan went to his room there. Krishnan told me to flee to Johor Bahru. He said that he would meet me there later. Until today I have not seen him. I did not commit the murder. The man appeared to be dead when I saw him.
 
 
 
On 19 September 1984, Suppiah Alagiri, the father of the first appellant, at the request of the first appellant, brought to the Criminal Investigation Department (`CID`) a pair of shoes belonging to the first appellant. These shoes were seized. The pattern on the sole of the shoes was similar to the pattern of the imprint in one of the two photographs taken at the scene.
On 1 October 1984, Suppiah Alagiri, again at the request of the first appellant, brought to the CID four pieces of imitation precious stones. These were seized. They were later identified by Purhanam as being part of the 30 imitation precious stones missing from her cupboard.
The second appellant was arrested by the Malaysian police on 30 December 1985 at Batu Gajah, Perak. He was sent to Singapore on 4 January 1986 and at about 4pm that day he was arrested by the Singapore police. The second appellant also made a s 122(6) statement. He objected to the admissibility of the statement on the grounds that he had been assaulted and threatened with being further assaulted if he did not make the statement in the way the inspector wanted. He had also been told that if he co-operated he could escape the gallows as he was under 21 at the time of the offence. The learned trial judges after a trial-within-a-trial were satisfied that the statement was voluntary and admitted it in evidence. This statement was as follows: 
 
I admit that Ramachandran and I committed the murder. I am the one who knocked the door. Both of us went in, Ramachandran kicked the deceased and held both his hands. I then stabbed the deceased. After stabbing the deceased, both Ramachandran and I went into the rooms and looked for money and jewellery. We found some money and jewellery which we took away with us. I got a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, and a lady`s watch from Ramachandran. I do not know what things Ramachandran took.
 
 
 
On the above evidence, the learned trial judges were satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out against both the appellants and called upon them to make their defence. This finding of a prima facie case was challenged in this appeal, particularly by counsel for the first appellant.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution as against the first appellant was: 
 
 
(1) His s 122(6) statement. 
 
(2) The presence of a shoe imprint in the hall with a tread similar to that of a pair of shoes belonging to the first appellant. 
 
(3) Four imitation precious stones recovered from the first appellant which were identified as being part of 30 such stones missing from the flat after the incident. 
 
(4) The confession (s 122(6) statement) of the second appellant.
  
 
 
The first appellant in his s 122(6) statement (the admissibility of which he did not challenge) had stated that he had gone into the flat with the second appellant after the incident in order to try to assist the second appellant to recover the knife the second appellant had used. That being so, the presence of a shoe imprint in the hall with a tread consistent with the tread on the first appellant`s shoes does not, by itself, take the case against the first appellant any further than what is contained in the s 122(6) statement. Similarly, the recovery of the four imitation precious stones from the first appellant does not take the case for the prosecution beyond what can reasonably be inferred from that statement.
Before an accused person can be called upon to make his defence the court has to be satisfied that the requirements of s 189 of the Criminal Procedure Code have been satisfied. Section 189 provides as follows: 
 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 
 
 
The Privy Council, in the oft-quoted case of 
 Haw Tua Tau v 
 
PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  has considered what the burden on the prosecution is at the end of the prosecution case and the test as enunciated therein by Lord Diplock is: whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if the court were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence.
There is nothing in the s 122(6) statement of the first appellant which shows or from which it can be inferred that the first appellant had, either by himself or in concert with the second appellant, intended to kill or even cause hurt to the deceased. All that that statement shows is that the first appellant had accompanied the second appellant that day in order to steal from the flat but on reaching the foot of the block of flats in which the deceased lived had refused to proceed further with the plan and the second appellant had taken the lift up and proceeded alone to the deceased`s flat. There is nothing in that statement to indicate that the first appellant knew that the second appellant was armed with any weapon. There was also no evidence to indicate that the first appellant knew that there would be anyone in the flat at that time. The only evidence in this regard was that the second appellant had made an appointment for the first appellant to take his brother to the flat at 11am for the deceased to interview the first appellant`s brother. There was no evidence that the first appellant knew about these arrangements. The conversation between Mutthu, Purhanam and the second appellant in which the appointment to see the deceased that morning was arranged was clearly hearsay and (in the absence of evidence of common intention) inadmissible as against the first appellant.
The learned trial judges found the first appellant`s s 122(6) statement `entirely exculpatory of Ramachandran`. This finding was not challenged before us. The s 122(6) statement being exculpatory, the only evidence left against the first appellant was the confession of the second appellant contained in the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement in which the second appellant had incriminated both himself and the first appellant. It would appear that the learned trial judges in calling upon the first appellant to make his defence had relied entirely on this s 122(6) statement by the second appellant. The s 122(6) statement made by the second appellant is admissible as evidence against the second appellant under s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code but can be used as evidence against the first appellant only if the requirements of s 30 of the Evidence Act are satisfied.
To understand s 30 it will be useful to look at some other sections in the Act dealing with admissions and confessions. By s 21 of the Evidence Act, admissions are declared to be relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them. An `admission` is defined in s 17(1) of the Evidence Act as a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact. Section 17(2) defines a `confession` as an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence. By s 24 of the Evidence Act, a confession is declared to be irrelevant if the making of the confession appears to have been caused by any inducement, threat, or promise, ie if the confession is not voluntary. By s 5 of the Evidence Act: `evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant`. The Evidence Act has declared admissions (which are against the interest of the party making them) and confessions made by an accused (so long as they are voluntary) to be relevant and accordingly evidence of such admissions or confessions may be given under ss 5 and 21 of the Act against the person who made the admission or confession.
To use a confession by an accused against a co-accused, s 30 of the Evidence Act would have to be complied with. Section 30 reads as follows: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
It is immediately apparent that the language used in s 30 is different from that used in ss 5, 21 and 24. Section 30 of the Act does not declare the confession of an accused where it incriminates a co-accused to be `relevant` as against the co-accused. All that s 30 provides is that `the court may take into consideration` such confession as against the co-accused.
The extent to which the court `may take into consideration` the confession of a co-accused that incriminates an accused person has been considered in numerous cases here, in Malaysia and in India. Perhaps the most well-known of these decisions is that of the Privy Council in 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 where at p 260 Sir John Beaumont said: 
 
Section 30 seems to be based on the view that an admission by an accused person of his own guilt affords some sort of sanction in support of the truth of his confession against others as well as himself. But a confession of a co-accused is obviously evidence of a very weak type. It does not indeed come within the definition of `evidence` contained in s 3, Evidence Act. It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by cross-examination. It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of those infirmities. Section 30, however, provides that the court may take the confession into consideration and thereby, no doubt, makes it evidence on which the court may act; but the section does not say that the confession is to amount to proof. 
 Clearly there must be other evidence
. The confession is only one element in the consideration of all the facts proved in the case; it can be put into the scale and weighed with the other evidence. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In 
Hari Charan Kurmi v State of Bihar,
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 the principles enunciated in 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 were re-stated by the Supreme Court of India. To quote from the judgment of Gajendragadkar CJ at p 630: 
 
When s 30 provides that the confession of a co-accused may be taken into consideration, what exactly is the scope and effect of such taking into consideration, is precisely the problem which has been raised in the present appeals. It is clear that the confession mentioned in s 30 is not evidence under s 3 of the Act. Section 3 defines `evidence` as meaning and including - 
(1) all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to matters of fact under inquiry; such statements are called oral evidence; 
(2) all documents produced for the inspection of the Court; such documents are called documentary evidence.
 
 
 
Technically construed, this definition will not apply to a confession. Part (1) of the definition refers to oral statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it; and clearly, a confession made by an accused person is not such a statement; it is not made or permitted to be made before the court that tries the criminal case. Part (2) of the definition refers to documents produced for the inspection of the court; and a confession cannot be said to fall even under this part. Even so, s 30 provides that a confession may be taken into consideration not only against its maker but also against a co-accused person; that is to say, though such a confession may not be evidence as strictly defined by s 3 of the Act, it is an element which may be taken into consideration by the criminal court and in that sense, it may be described as evidence in a non-technical way. But it is significant that like other evidence which is produced before the court, it is not obligatory on the court to take the confession into account. When evidence as defined by the Act is produced before the court, it is the duty of the court to consider that evidence. What weight should be attached to such evidence, is a matter in the discretion of the court. But a court cannot say in respect of such evidence that it will just not take that evidence into account. Such an approach can, however, be adopted by the court in dealing with a confession, because s 30 merely enables the court to take the confession into account.
 
 
 
As we have already indicated, this question has been considered on several occasions by judicial decisions and it has been consistently held that a confession cannot be treated as evidence which is substantive evidence against a co-accused person. In dealing with a criminal case where the prosecution relies upon the confession of one accused person against another accused person, the proper approach to adopt is to consider the other evidence against such an accused person, and if the said evidence appears to be satisfactory and the court is inclined to hold that the said evidence may sustain the charge framed against the said accused person, the court turns to the confession with a view to assure itself that the conclusion which it is inclined to draw from the other evidence is right. As was observed by Sir Lawrence Jenkins in 
 Emperor v Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty 
 a confession can only be used to `lend assurance to other evidence against a co-accused`. In 
 In re Peryaswami Moopan 
, Reilly J observed that the provision of s 30 goes not further than this: `where there is evidence against the co-accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession described in s 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence.` (Emphasis added.)
In 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 and in 
Hari Charan Kurmi v State of Bihar
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 there is reference to the fact that the confession of a co-accused does not come within the definition of `evidence` in s 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. It is to be noted that the definition of `evidence` (in the Indian Act) is an exhaustive one in that `evidence` is defined as `meaning and including` the matters enumerated in the two subsections following. That definition is different from the definition in our Evidence Act in that in our Act `evidence` is defined to `include` the two subsections. In our view, the fact that `evidence` in the Indian Act is given an exhaustive definition does not affect the conclusions reached by the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of India in their interpretation of s 30. In both 
Bhuboni Sahu
 
[1949] PC 257
 and 
Hari Charan Kurmi
 
[1964] 6 SCR 623
 the court, whilst recognizing that the definition of `evidence` would exclude the confession made by a co-accused, nevertheless noted that s 30 of the Act made such confessions evidence on which the court may act. What our Evidence Act does is to recognize that an exhaustive definition of `evidence` will not sit well with sections of the Act, such as s 30, which permit the court to consider matters which fall outside the definition. In our Act therefore the word `evidence` is given an inclusive definition. We are of the view that the differences in the way `evidence` is defined in our Act and the Indian Act do not make any difference to the principles enunciated in the above cases.
In 
Yusoff & Anor v PP
 
 [1956] 22 MLJ 47 
 the Malayan Court of Appeal considered the meaning to be given to the words `may take into consideration` in s 30 of the Evidence Ordinance. Mathew CJ in delivering the judgment of the court said at p 48: 
 
The effect of the words `may take into consideration` is well set out in Woodroffe and Ameer Ali`s 
 Law of Evidence
 (9th Ed) at pp 312 and 313, as follows:
 
 
 
`These words do not mean that the confession is to have the force of sworn evidence, but such a confession is nevertheless evidence in the sense that it is matter which the court, before whom it is made, may take into consideration in order to determine whether the issue of guilt is proved or not. The wording, however, of this section (which is an exception) shows that such a confession is merely to be an element in the consideration of all the facts of the case; while allowing it to be so considered, it does not do away with the necessity of other evidence.`
 
 
 
And, in dealing with the facts of that case, Mathew CJ continued: 
 
The other evidence is of little, if of any, value and merely shows that the two appellants were seen together about midnight on 19/20 September 1955. In fact, the convictions rest entirely on the confession of the second appellant which we have already pointed out is wrong.
 
 
 
And in 
PP v Nordin bin Johan & Anor,
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  Raja Azlan Shah LP in giving the decision of the Federal Court (of Malaysia) said at p 222: 
 
This leaves the question of the application of the provisions of s 30 of the Evidence Act 1950 in relation to the two respondents as a result of the statement made by Rahmat Satiman, the third accused in these proceedings, which was admitted and accepted and which clearly implicates the two respondents. 
 Section 30 provides that this statement may be taken into consideration against the two respondents but on the decided authorities the prerequisite to this is that there must be some cogent evidence against them quite apart from the statement of the third accused.
The nature of this evidence which would be extraneous to the confession of a co-accused and its qualitative and probative value in relation to the charge must 
 ex necessitate rei
 be a factual matter in the context and circumstances of the particular case.
 
 
 
Having considered the evidence against the two respondents which is fairly voluminous and lengthy, the learned judge came to the conclusion that it did not in relation to them have any real probative value to the charge and even taken as a whole did not take the prosecution case anywhere for the purposes of proving common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code. The learned trial judge had opportunities which are denied to us of considering whether it would be safe to draw the inference that the two respondents were present at the scene of the crime and participated in the commission of the offence. He said: 
 
`Does the totality of the evidence against the second accused and the fourth accused excluding the confession (P101) lead the court to the irresistible inference that they were present at the scene of the crime and participated in the commission of the offence? I am afraid I am unable to honestly give an affirmative answer to this question.` ... We are satisfied that the evidence against the two respondents, apart from the third accused`s confession, was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the charge against them and that calling on their defence would on the authorities not only go beyond taking into consideration the third accused`s statement but be tantamount to virtually relying on it to an extent that would not be permissible for the purposes of s 30 of the Evidence Act. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal in Singapore in 
Koh Ah Chua & Ors v PP
 
 [1948] 14 MLJ 11 
 dealt with the application of s 30 of the Evidence Act. In setting aside the conviction of the fourth appellant in that case, Murray-Anysley CJ said (at p 12): 
 
In the case of the fourth appellant a serious question arose. The principal evidence against him consisted of a confession made by a co-accused to a magistrate and duly proved at the trial. Apart from this the most that could be said was that some of the evidence tended to corroborate parts of the confession.
 
 
 
Section 30 of the Evidence Enactment, which alone makes it possible to consider such a confession, merely says that the court may take into consideration such confession. 
 No legislation can add to the value of such a confession as evidence. 
 We consider that its value is less than that of the evidence of an accomplice because it was made in the absence of the appellant, was not made on oath nor subject to cross-examination, and usually in such cases the person making the confession attributes the chief blame to others.
In the circumstances we do not consider that the evidence against the fourth appellant was sufficient, and his appeal is allowed and conviction quashed. (Emphasis added.)
And recently this court in 
Sim Ah Cheoh v PP
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 353
  again accepted the narrow construction to the words `may take into consideration` favoured by the courts. In delivering the decision of the court, LP Thean J referred to the cases of 
Bhuboni Sahu v The King
 
[1949] PC 257
 
Kashmira Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh,
 
[1952] SC 526
 
Yusoff & Anor v PP

 and 
PP v Nordin bin Johan & Anor
 
 
[1983] 2 MLJ 221
  as undoubted authorities on the construction and application of s 30 of the Evidence Act and agreed with the views expressed in these decisions.
On the basis of the decided authorities, it is abundantly clear that the confession of a co-accused can only play a supportive role in a criminal prosecution. It cannot by itself form the basis of a conviction. In this case, apart from the confession of the second appellant, there was no evidence before the court to establish that the first appellant on 27 July 1984, `in furtherance of the common intention between him and the second appellant committed murder by causing the death of the deceased`. That being so, by reason of s 189 of the Criminal Procedure Code, his defence should not have been called and the court should have recorded an order of acquittal.
As for the second appellant, the evidence against him at the close of the prosecution case consisted essentially of the confession made by him in his s 122(6) statement. Although that was a retracted confession, the learned trial judges were satisfied that it was voluntarily given. We can see no reason to interfere with this finding of fact by the learned trial judges. The courts have always treated confessions (especially retracted confessions) with caution but there can be no doubt that such a confession is evidence against the maker of the confession and can by itself constitute a prima facie case. Indeed, counsel for the second appellant has not sought to submit otherwise. What he did submit was that as there was, as against the first appellant, no evidence of common intention, the second appellant`s defence should not have been called on the charge as framed.
On the basis of the confession of the second appellant there was, at the close of the case for the prosecution, evidence before the court (which was not inherently incredible) that the second appellant had stabbed the deceased. There was also evidence that the deceased had been stabbed a number of times, that the fatal stab wound was in the region of the neck, that that wound was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, that moderate force would be required to inflict that wound and that that wound was probably inflicted in a frontal assault on the deceased whilst the deceased was standing up. At the close of the prosecution case there was clearly a prima facie case made out against the second appellant under s 302 of the Penal Code.
The question that has to be considered is whether the fact that the defence of the second appellant was called on a charge that included an averment of a common intention between him and the first appellant (as to which there was no evidence) had so vitiated the proceedings that the conviction against the second appellant ought to be set aside.
An appeal court will set aside a conviction on the grounds that there was an error in the charge only if such error has occasioned a failure of justice (see s 396 of the Criminal Procedure Code). We perused the record in detail but could find nothing therein which indicated that calling on the defence of the second appellant on a charge which included the reference to common intention with the first appellant in any way prejudiced the second appellant. Counsel submitted that the fact that the first appellant was (wrongly) called on to make his defence was by itself prejudicial to the second appellant. We could not accept that submission. The record shows that, if at all, the evidence given by the first appellant in his defence was supportive and not prejudicial to the defence of the second appellant.
The learned trial judges` summary of the evidence given by the second appellant was as follows: 
 
After he had stabbed the deceased on the stomach, the deceased put up a struggle. Krishnan attempted to pull the letter-opener away from the deceased whereas the deceased was pulling his hand with the letter-opener towards himself. Krishnan claimed that thereafter he suffered a complete loss of memory and he did not know how the deceased was fatally stabbed in the throat ... According to Krishnan, the next thing he knew was that he ran away from the deceased intending to take refuge in the room when the deceased chased after him and collapsed in a pool of blood. He suggested that the fatal stabbing was entirely accidental; he did not know how it happened and he kept reiterating that he had no intention to kill the deceased. Krishnan explained that he had brought along the letter-opener, tucked in his trousers, so that it could be used to break open the locks and cupboard doors.
 
 
 
The learned trial judges completely rejected this evidence. In rejecting it, they said: 
 
Krishnan`s version given before us was even more incredible. He did not give any reason as to why he was unable to recall how the fatal wound was inflicted. Against this claim of a total lack of knowledge as to what transpired, we have the fact that the letter-opener he was holding had caused the fatal gash at the throat of the deceased. We are of the view that a struggle between them had not taken place. The deceased did not have any defensive wound which a struggle like that described by Krishnan would most probably have left behind. Moreover, the condition of the flat immediately after the discovery of the deceased`s body did not suggest any sign of a struggle.
 
 
 
The learned trial judges found the defence of the second appellant to be `incredible`. They considered the evidence against, and the defence of, each appellant separately. Having done so they concluded that the second appellant when he stabbed the deceased intended to kill him. That was a finding of fact which the learned trial judges, on the evidence before them, were entitled to arrive at. We saw no reason to interfere with that finding. Accordingly, in respect of the first appellant, we allowed the appeal and ordered that he be acquitted and discharged. In respect of the second appellant, we dismissed the appeal and, in view of the first appellant`s acquittal, directed that the references in the charge to the first appellant and to s 34 be deleted.

A dislodged water hose connection in an industrial building caused a flood which led to these proceedings.
The defendant occupied unit #07-10, Block 20B, Henderson Industrial Park, in which it was setting up rotary screen engraving equipment. The equipment included a cooling system in the form of a water chiller. The chiller was supplied with water through a flexible hose. The far end of the hose was attached to a water point fitted with a stopcock and a smooth copper pipe. The end of the hose was attached to the copper pipe and secured by a ring clip.
Sometime during the night of 15 June and the morning of 16 June 1990, the hose slipped off the pipe. Water escaped and flooded the defendant`s premises and the adjoining units on the same floor, including the plaintiff`s store, where medical supplies were kept. The medical supplies were damaged by the water, and the plaintiff sought damages from the defendant.
The plaintiff`s claim against the defendant was founded on three causes of action - negligence, nuisance, and the principle in 
 Rylands v Fletcher. 
 (The third cause of action was not specifically pleaded, but the defendant did not object, and replied to the plaintiff`s submissions thereon.)
The defendant in its defence denied the flooding of the plaintiff`s premises, and asserted that it had engaged the third party, a competent independent contractor, to fit the connection. The defendant also brought the third party into the proceedings.
The area of work undertaken by the third party was relevant in resolving the issues between the parties. The third party was engaged to install the air pipes, gas pipes and exhaust pipes for the equipment (notes of evidence p 31C), and while doing that, it was asked to connect the flexible hose to a water point. In their statement of claim against the third party the defendant did not plead that the third party supplied or installed the copper pipe. In its defence, the third party alleged that the defendant had installed a smooth pipe when it should have installed a threaded or jagged pipe. It was common ground that the water point and stopcock were fitted by another contractor who installed the water pipes, and the copper pipe was added later.
The defendant`s managing director, Mr Shih Hing Wong, said that the copper pipe was supplied by the third party (notes of evidence pp 31F-32A). The third party`s site supervisor, Mr Khoo Min Kee, denied that, but admitted that he gave instructions to the water pipe contractor regarding the copper pipe. He said: `I did tell the water pipe contractor how to put in pipe with the stopcock on. He said he will put the piping for me. I did not tell the defendant or the pipe contractor to change the smooth pipe to a jagged pipe.` (notes of evidence p 57B-C). On this evidence, I find the third party to be responsible for the fitting of the copper pipe.
On the issue of negligence, the questions raised were (1) whether it was proper to attach the hose to a smooth pipe, (2) whether the stopcock should be closed during the night, and (3) whether the connection had been interfered with.
Mr Shih said that he relied on the third party to supply and connect the hose. He did not know whether it was connected to a smooth or threaded pipe because he did not examine the connection after it was installed.
The third party`s employee, Mr Neo Seng Kiat, who installed the connection said that after he inserted the hose onto the pipe and tightened the clip, he pulled it to see if it was tight, and it did not come off. The supervisor, Mr Khoo, also pulled the hose and found it to be securely fixed (notes of evidence pp 52F-53A).
During the hearing, it transpired that the third party did not do water piping (notes of evidence p 57E). Nevertheless, Mr Khoo considered himself to be competent to attach a hose to a water pipe (notes of evidence p 58B), and maintained that a smooth pipe can be used if a hose clip is applied and tightened with a screwdriver (notes of evidence p 58D).
The third party also called Mr Chow Ngai Mun, a mechanical engineer, as its witness. Mr Chow had carried out tests on a connection using the same types of flexible hose, smooth copper tube and clip used in the failed connection (TP 2 B 1-12 and TP B 1-2). His tests showed that at a water pressure of three bar (which he said was the pressure at the defendant`s premises), the connection leaked, but the hose did not slip, and it did not slip even when the pressure was increased to seven bar. Unfortunately, he did not say how long it took for the leak to develop, or how long the connection was tested before he stopped each test. He concluded that: `A connection of a hose to a smooth pipe with a clip is sufficient to withstand normal water pressure` and that `I am certain if the copper pipe and flexible hose are properly tightened, it could not slip off` (notes of evidence pp 63F and 64B). Mr Chow was asked about the leak and its effect. He agreed that on the night and in the morning of 15 and 16 June, the connection could have leaked, and the leak became progressively bigger before the hose slipped off. He also agreed that such a condition was not static or stable (notes of evidence pp 66F-67B).
Mr Loh Wan Sern, a surveyor, gave evidence on this issue on behalf of the defendant. He said that the copper pipe used was of soft copper which may deform or flatten if the clip is over-tightened (notes of evidence p 48E) and he was of the view that a serrated pipe should have been used. I placed no weight on his opinion because firstly, he had not conducted any tests to support his conclusion, secondly, he admitted to having no experience with water pressure, and thirdly, he did not state any basis which would qualify him to give any admissible opinion on the issue. I also disregarded the evidence of Mr Pang Soon Guan, another loss adjustor, because he did not see the original connection, did not conduct any tests, and was not qualified to give opinion evidence on the issue.
On the evidence, I find that the use of the smooth copper pipe and clip was inadequate. From Mr Chow`s tests, the connection will leak even if the clip is properly tightened. A leaking connection cannot be satisfactory by the fact of the leak itself and because a leak, if undetected and unchecked, could lead to the dislodging of the hose. It was submitted on behalf of the third party that as the hose did not become detached till 15 or 16 June although it was fixed in late May, the hose must have been properly fitted. I do not accept that as a necessary inference. Given the likelihood that the connection could leak and that the leak may result in the hose giving way, it is not self-evident that the connection was secure just because it held till 15 June. There must be facts or admissible opinion to support that assertion, but none was adduced.
I now turn to the stopcock. If it was closed the water supply would be cut off. It would be less likely for the hose to slip, and there would not be a flood even if it did. Counsel for the plaintiff and third party relied on the fact that the stopcock was not closed, but they did not lead any evidence to show that stopcocks should be closed when the water supply is not needed during the night. Mr Shih said that the water supply system to the water chiller was similar to that of the water cistern in a toilet, in that a ball float controls the water supply so that when the water reaches a certain level, the supply is cut off (notes of evidence p 43C to E), and he was not contradicted. I find that there is no duty to close the stopcock to the supply to the chiller inasmuch as one is not expected or required to close the stopcock to the supply of a toilet overnight.
It was not pleaded by the third party that the connection was interfered with, but counsel for the defendant did not object to the issue being raised at the trial.
The third party asserted that a new clip was used when the hose was attached. When Mr Chow examined the dismantled connection produced during the hearing, he found damage on the clip that could have been caused by a screwdriver and a spanner (notes of evidence p 64D) and it was submitted that this showed that the connection had been interfered with.
The difficulty with this contention was that there was no evidence when the connection was dismantled and replaced. Mr Shih could only say that it was done in the course of carrying out maintenance work on the water chiller (notes of evidence p 44A). The damage was as likely to have been caused when the connection was refitted after the flood or when it was eventually replaced, as to have been caused before the flood.
The third party`s supervisor, Mr Khoo, said that when he completed the job, there were other contractors at the site, whom he believed to be the partition and electrical contractors (notes of evidence pp 56F and 57A). When counsel for the third party raised the issue with Miss Ooi Kheng Bee, an employee of the defendant, she said that the other contractors had finished their work when the third party fitted the hose (notes of evidence pp 23C, 24E and 25E). Mr Shih also said that he was there when the connection was done, and there were no other contractors working at that time (notes of evidence pp 41A and 45C). The court was faced with conflicting bare assertions, when more specific evidence could have been adduced. For the defendant, it can be said that they had no notice that the third party would raise the issue, but the third party should have adduced more evidence in support of its assertion. In the circumstances, I find that there was no satisfactory evidence that other contractors were present, or that anyone had interfered with the connection.
On the basis of these findings of fact, I find that the defendant was negligent. The defendant owed a duty of care to ensure that the plumbing connections on its premises were secure and would not cause any flooding to its neighbours` premises. The defendant had delegated this duty to an independent contractor, the third party, a company that did gas piping but not water piping(notes of evidence p 57E) without ascertaining whether it was competent to do the job (notes of evidence p 62A). Although the defendant would be exonerated if it diligently appointed a competent independent contractor to do the work, the defendant was liable because it did not exercise reasonable care in appointing the third party -see 
 Jolliffe v Willmett & Co & Anor 
. The defendant is therefore vicariously liable for any negligence of the third party.
On the third party`s part, they asked for the smooth copper pipe to be fitted by the water pipe contractor (notes of evidence p 57B) and had supplied the hose and clip. At some time, the connection must have leaked and then parted. The irresistible inference, after discounting interference, was that the use of the copper pipe and the single ring clip was inadequate to provide a secure connection. In the circumstances, I find the third party was negligent in the choice of the smooth pipe and in using a single ring clip to secure the hose to it. The third party must therefore indemnify the defendant against the plaintiff`s claim.
I then considered the claim founded on nuisance. When one party`s occupation or use of land results in injury to another party, the ingredients for liability in negligence and in nuisance are often the same. However, counsel for the defendant submitted that the single incident of flooding cannot constitute a nuisance, citing Thesiger J`s judgment in 
 SCM (United Kingdom) Ltd v WJ Whittal & Son Ltd 
. In this case the defendant, who were building contractors, hammered a metal tube into a bottom of a trench and damaged an electrical cable, and caused a power failure to the plaintiff`s factory. The plaintiff took out an action against the defendant on negligence and nuisance. Thesiger J found the defendant liable in negligence but not in nuisance, saying: 
 
Where there is no doubt that a single isolated escape may cause the damage that entitles a plaintiff to sue for nuisance, yet it must be proved that the nuisance arose from the condition of the defendant`s land or premises or property or activities thereon that constituted a nuisance. I am satisfied that one negligent act that causes physical damage to an electrical cable does not thereby constitute a nuisance.
 
 
 
Thesiger J distinguished 
 British Celanese Ltd v AH Hunt (Capacitors) Ltd. 
 In this case, the defendant, manufacturers of electronic components, stored metal foil strips on their land. Wind blew some of the strips onto a power sub-station, causing a disruption of electric supply to the plaintiff`s factory. The defendant contended that the isolated happening was not enough to constitute a nuisance, and that there must be a continuing condition. Lawson J rejected that argument, saying: 
 
Most nuisances do arise from a long continuing condition, and many isolated happenings do not constitute a nuisance. It is, however, clear from the authorities that an isolated happening by itself can create an actionable nuisance.
 
 
 
These views can be reconciled by reference to the `state of affairs` element of nuisance - see 
 Street on Torts 
 (8th Ed) at pp 319-321, and 
 Salmond & Heuston - The Law of Torts 
 (12th Ed) at pp 59-60. Jenkins LJ said in 
 Stone v Bolton 
:5 `The gist of ... nuisance is the causing or permitting of a state of affairs from which damage is likely to result` and in 
 Spicer v Smee, 
 Atkinson J said `... private nuisance arises out of a state of things on one man`s property whereby his neighbour`s property is exposed to danger`.
Where there is a potentially dangerous state of affairs on land, a single incident may set off the danger. When that happens, the occupant is liable, as the defendant in 
 British Celanese 
, was for storing metal foil strips on its land. Damage may also result from an act which is not related to any state of affairs on the land, as it happened in 
 SCM v Whittal 
, and in such a situation no liability in nuisance arises.
In the present case, the flooding was connected to the deficient hose connection - an existing state of affairs on the premises. For this reason, I find that the flooding constituted a nuisance.
However, the plaintiff`s claim under the principle in 
 Rylands v Fletcher 
, fails. To succeed, the plaintiff must establish that there was a non-natural use of the defendant`s premises. As Lord Moulton had said in 
 Rickards v Lothian: 
 
 
It is not every use to which land is put that brings into play that principle. It must be some special use bringing with it increased danger to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of land or such a use as is proper for the benefit of the community.
 
 
 
In determining whether a specific user is an ordinary or natural use, one must consider the time and the type of land involved. As Lord Parker said in 
 Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd 
, `all the circumstances of the time and place and practice of mankind must be taken into consideration so that what might be regarded as dangerous or non-natural may vary according to those circumstances`. Activities on land and buildings considered non-natural a generation ago may be common now, when there are land and buildings which are developed to cater for designated activities. In 
 British Celanese 
, the defendants were carrying on business as manufacturers of electronic components in a trading estate. Lawson J dismissed the plaintiffs` claim on the principle in 
 Rylands v Fletcher 
, saying: 
 
The defendants are alleged to occupy premises on a trading estate. Such estates are planned and laid out for the purpose of accommodating manufacturers. The defendants are manufacturers. It follows that they are using this site for the very purpose for which sites were made available on the estate. The use of the site for manufacturing would be an ordinary one; the use of the site for any other purpose would be unusual. Does the particular kind of manufacturing which is done in the defendant`s factory constitute, in Lord Moulton`s words `some special use bringing with it increased danger to others`? The manufacturing of electrical and electronic components in the year 1964, which is the material date, cannot be adjudged to be a special use nor can the bringing and storing on the premises of metal foil be a special use in itself.
 
 
 
The defendant brought in water into its premises through a half-inch diameter pipe (notes of evidence p 34C). There was no evidence that the volume of water supplied or the use of the chiller was out of the ordinary. I am unable to say that the installation of a water chiller in an industrial building was a non-natural use in 1990.
The issue of damages was relatively straightforward. The damage to the plaintiff`s goods was surveyed by Mr Denny Sim from a company of loss adjusters. Mr Sim submitted reports of his survey and gave evidence at the hearing. He inspected water-affected cartons and cases at the plaintiff`s store and reviewed the plaintiff`s computation of the losses at $123,066. He found that goods to the value of $1,232.72 claimed to be damaged were not damaged. He also found errors in the prices amounting to $7,344 and that the whole claim was marked up by 10%. Accordingly, he reduced the claim to $103,040.35 - $2,108.27 for totally damaged goods and $100,938.28 for partially damaged goods. The claim for the partially damaged goods was settled for $60,599, or 60% of its value with the plaintiff keeping the goods. He said that the settlement at this figure was not excessive; from his experience in a normal case, the realization value is between 10% and 20%, and in this case it was agreed at 40%.1 There was also a claim for salvage expenses of $1,120 which he accepted.
Mr Sim`s evidence on the loss was not seriously or effectively challenged, and no other figures were put forth by the defendant and the third party. In the circumstances, I allow the plaintiff`s claims of $2,108.27 for the totally damaged goods, $60,599 for the partially damaged goods and $1,120 for salvage expenses.
However, the plaintiff also made a claim of $3,664 for survey fees. There was nothing to show that it paid the fees. On the contrary, the invoices for the fees produced were not even issued to the plaintiff, but to two insurance companies (PB57 and PB58). I reject this item of the plaintiff`s claim.
In the circumstances, I enter judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $63,787.27 with interest at 6% pa from 2 April 1991 (the date of the writ) to the date of judgment and I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff two-thirds of the taxed costs, as the plaintiff has succeeded on two out of the three causes of action pleaded.
In the third party proceedings, I order the third party to indemnify the defendant against the damages, interest and costs that it has to pay to the plaintiff, and to pay the costs of the third party proceedings.
Order accordingly.",1993-07-10 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff was at the material time the owner of a car, BMW 3201A, bearing registration No EH 8118R. The defendants were the owners and operators of a night club known as Grand Palace De-luxe Nite Club at the Orchard Building. In connection with the operation of the night club, the defendants provided to their customers a car parking service at the front porch of the building. Attendants, known generally as car jockeys, were engaged and they stationed themselves at or near the front porch and offered to park cars of customers and others visiting the night club. There were two public car parks, one in front of the Orchard Building and one at the side, and cars were normally parked in these car parks.
On 4 April 1985, at about 11pm, the plaintiff went to the night club in his car and upon arrival at or near the front porch of the Orchard Building, he handed his car together with the key to a car jockey who attended on him and in exchange he was handed a ticket bearing No 16757. The jockey took over the car and drove it to a public car park; the plaintiff entered the night club. The plaintiff left the night club at about 1am on the following morning and requested a jockey to bring his car. The jockey, however, could not find the car or the key as both were missing.
On 28 August 1985 the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendants claiming damages for breach of contract or, in the alternative, for negligence. By his statement of claim (as subsequently amended) the plaintiff averred that he had handed and delivered his car to the defendants, their servants or agents on the implied condition that the defendants, their servants or agents would keep it safely and redeliver it to the plaintiff on demand, and in breach of this implied condition they had failed to keep the car safely and redeliver it to the plaintiff on demand. In the alternative, the plaintiff averred that the defendants, their servants or agents were negligent and by reason of their negligence (particulars of which were set out) the plaintiff suffered damage. In further alternative, the plaintiff averred that the defendants wrongfully failed, neglected or refused to redeliver the car to the plaintiff and thereby wrongfully detained the car whereby the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage.
In their defence (as subsequently amended) the defendants averred that at all material times the car parking service rendered to their customers was provided by an independent contractor, Lim Soo Kuang, and the defendants were not liable or responsible for any error or omission of the independent contractor and/or his servant or agent. In the alternative, the defendants averred that there was no contract between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the car parking service was provided as a convenience and purely on a gratuitous basis and the plaintiff did not pay any sum for the service. In the further alternative, the defendants relied on a condition which they said was printed on the reverse side of the parking ticket handed to the plaintiff and also on a condition printed on a red notice board placed at or near the front porch of the building (the details of which I shall set out in a moment), both of which seek to exclude any liability of the defendants for loss or damage to cars of their customers. In the final alternative, the defendants pleaded that the car was parked at the public car park and the defendants, their servants or agents were acting as agents for the plaintiff for the purpose of parking the plaintiff`s car at the car park and were therefore not liable for any errors or omissions of such agents.
On the basis of the pleadings, the following issues have been raised:
 
 
(i) whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff was at the material time a servant or agent of the defendants; 
 
(ii) whether there was, at the material time, a relationship between the plaintiff as the bailor and the defendants as the bailee in respect of the car; 
 
(iii) if there was such a relationship, whether the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailees; 
 
(iv) whether the defendants were relieved from liability by reason of the condition on the notice board and/or the condition on the reverse side of the parking ticket issued to the plaintiff, and 
 
(v) finally, if the defendants are liable, the measure of damages.
  
 
 
There was one further issue raised by the defence, namely, whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff at the public car park did so as the servant or agent for the plaintiff. However, no argument was advanced by counsel for the defendants on this issue, and accordingly I do not propose to consider it.
I now turn to the evidence. The plaintiff`s evidence was that on the night of 4 April 1985, at about 11pm, he drove his car to the defendants` night club at the Orchard Building and on arrival at or near the front car porch of the building he found that there were car jockeys around. He said that he knew that they were jockeys of the night club, as they wore bush jackets with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket. He got out of the car, took the key from the dash board and handed it to a car jockey in attendance, and in return he received a ticket. The jockey took away his car and he went into the night club. He further said that he had been there several times and there were always jockeys around at or near the front porch who parked his car for him. At or near the porch there was a table where the jockeys would gather and there was also a key cabinet fixed to the wall on top of the table. In respect of the ticket issued to him on that occasion he said that he did not see any printed words on the reverse side, which was blank. He went up to the night club and had drinks with some friends. He left at about 1am on the following morning. When he came down, he gave the ticket to a jockey and waited for his car. He was later told that the car could not be found and the jockey was looking for the key also. Thereafter, he went round the whole car park looking for his car but could not find it. Nor could the key to his car be found. The manager and two others from the night club came down and made enquiries with the jockeys and also tried to look for the car; they could not find it either. Both the car and the key were lost. In the boot of his car were various items including his attache case, his pen, his watch and three squash racquets. He was referred to the photographs showing the positions of the table, key cabinet and the entrance. He said that the table and the key cabinet were about 15m from the entrance. He said he never saw the red notice board which the defendants claimed was placed at a position above the table and the key cabinet.
Apart from the question of the value of his car, the plaintiff adduced no other evidence. There was, however, no dispute on the plaintiff`s evidence that on the evening of 4 April 1985 he went to the night club in his car and handed it to a car jockey who attended on him and that both the car and key were missing. The dispute was centred on his evidence that the car jockeys wore uniforms with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket, that the reverse side of the ticket handed to the plaintiff was blank and that he did not see the red notice board placed on top of the key cabinet at or near the entrance.
The defendants called several witnesses. The first was one Ms Kwan Oon Kim who at the material time was working as the vice-chairman and director in the defendants` night club and her responsibilities were mostly administrative including the collection of daily cash. She testified that the defendants provided a car parking service to their customers and engaged one Lim Soo Kuang (`Lim`) to provide three to four jockeys every night for that purpose, for which he was paid $1,000 a month. The defendants had no control over the jockeys provided by Lim. The car parking service was purely for the convenience of the customers of the night club. She was referred to the photographs taken of the entrance to the night club and she testified that the table was about 5-6ft away from the entrance. She said that the red notice board appearing on the photograph was there at all material times.
Lim was called as a witness. He testified that he provided jockeys to night clubs and the defendants` night club was one of them. His arrangement with the defendants was that he provided three to four jockeys every night and the defendants paid him $1,000 per month and he in turn paid the jockeys. He gave instructions to the jockeys as to how to service the customers. Initially, he was at the defendants` night club every night, but later he was there only once or twice a week. After he instructed the jockeys on what to do he did not go there frequently.
The chairman of the board of directors of the defendants at the material time was one Tan Hwee Peow (`Tan`), and he also gave evidence. He was with the defendants until 1989. He was aware that a car parking service was provided to customers of the night club and that Lim provided the jockeys. The arrangement with Lim was made by the manager of the defendants, Allan Foo. He confirmed that the defendants paid Lim $1,000 per month and that Lim was to provide three to four jockeys every night. He said that the defendants provided Lim with tickets - he called them coupons - which they used in parking cars for the customers. He produced a specimen of the ticket that was used, on the face of which was printed a condition that the defendants were not liable for any loss of the car. With regard to the red notice board he said it was placed near the entrance of the building every night. The notice board would be taken down after work and kept in the defendants` office. The counterfoil portion of the ticket has a hole and that was used to attach it to the car key and the key was then hung up in the key cabinet. He produced a specimen of the ticket which the defendants gave to Lim and said that the defendants printed 50,000 tickets for use. All the tickets have words on both sides as shown on D2.
Finally, the defendants called Johari bin Mohamad Yatim (`Johari`), who was one of the jockeys in attendance on the night of 4 April 1985. He confirmed that he was employed by Lim and that he worked part time as a jockey. In 1985 he worked at the defendants` night club with three other jockeys. He said that when he parked the cars for the customers, he was not paid any money and he would park the cars at the public car park in front of Orchard Building. He further said that at that time there was a red notice board placed near the entrance. Every night when he and his colleagues started work they would bring down the table, the key cabinet and the red notice board from the defendants` office. The red notice board would be placed on top of the key cabinet. He confirmed that his service was to offer to park cars for customers who drove up to the front porch and who required jockeys to park their cars. He would use the tickets thus: one part of the ticket would be given to the customer and the other part, the counterfoil with a hole, would be retained until the customers came to collect their cars. He would write down the car number on the counterfoil and attach the key to it which was then put in the key cabinet.
Before I turn to the main issues raised before me, there are several disputed questions of fact in respect of which I ought to make my findings. The first is whether the jockeys employed to provide the car parking service to customers of the defendants` night club were employed by the defendants or Lim. On this, there was the evidence of Lim that the defendants engaged him to provide three or four jockeys every night to attend to their customers and park their cars. His evidence was corroborated by that of Ms Kwan, Tan and Johari, and the latter was one of the car jockeys who attended on customers of the night club on the evening of 4 April 1985. I accept their evidence on this point and I find that the car jockeys at all material times were in fact employed by Lim and not by the defendants.
The second question is whether the car jockeys at all material times wore any uniform provided by the defendants. The evidence of the plaintiff was that he had been to the night club many times, that there were jockeys around at or near the front porch and they each wore a bush jacket with the name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket. This was not admitted by Ms Kwan and Tan. But Lim did say that the defendants provided each of the jockeys with a white shirt but that the words `Grand Palace` were not printed on the front pocket. I am inclined to accept his evidence that the defendants did provide the car jockeys each with a white shirt. It seems to me that if the defendants had taken the trouble to provide these jockeys with white shirts it is more likely than not that they would have the words `Grand Palace` printed on the front pockets of the shirts as maintained by the plaintiff. I would accept the evidence of the plaintiff on this point, and on the balance of probabilities I find that the defendants at all material times provided each of the jockeys with a white shirt with their name `Grand Palace` printed on the front pocket.
The third disputed question of fact is whether at all material times the defendants displayed on the top of the key cabinet, which was near the entrance to the building, the red notice board bearing the following condition: 
 
Your vehicle is parked at your own risk. The management of Grand Palace Deluxe Niteclub shall not be responsible for any theft loss of/damage to the vehicle or its contents occasioned by the misfeasance, acts or omission or negligence of its employee and/or agent and/or the misfeasance, acts or omission or negligence of third parties.
 
 
 
and also whether the portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff by the jockey in exchange for his car bore the following condition: 
 
Please be informed that the car parking services are provided for the convenience of our guest. All damages, accidents or losses are at guests` own risks.
 
 
 
There was certainly credible evidence given by Lim, Tan and Johari that at the material time there was a red notice board above the key cabinet near the entrance to the building and the notice board bore that condition. Tan`s evidence was that at that time the defendants had the notice board and the jockeys were instructed to display the notice board every evening. Lim said that he was given this notice board by the defendants and he instructed the jockeys to put up the notice board every evening. Johari confirmed that there was this red notice board and said that every evening when he and his colleagues turned up for work they would take the table, the key cabinet and the notice board from the defendants` office, and the notice board would be placed in a designated place above the key cabinet. On a balance of probabilities I find that at all material times the defendants had displayed the red notice board at the position above the key cabinet.
As regards the condition appearing on that portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff, the evidence adduced was far from satisfactory. The plaintiff`s evidence was that that portion of the ticket did not have any such condition printed on it. He produced only a photocopy thereof and said he had lost the original. The copy has only the obverse side, and the reverse side was not reproduced. The defendants produced photocopies of both sides of an entire ticket which consisted of both portions used at the time: one with a hole which was to be retained by the jockey and to be attached to the key for hanging onto the key cabinet and the other to be given to a customer. These two portions appear on PB2. It appears from the impression of the holes on these copies that only the portion retained by the jockey had the condition printed thereon, and no such condition was printed on that portion given to the customer. This I must say is extremely odd; nonetheless, this is the conclusion I have come to from a close perusal of PB2. My only inference is that there was an error on the part of the jockeys and they had issued to the customers the portions of the tickets which they should have retained. The defendants then produced a specimen of a ticket, D2, which they claimed was used at the material time. D2 has two portions which are identical and are detachable, and each portion of D2 on the reverse side bore the condition. However, D2 is different from PB2, and I am not satisfied from the evidence that D2 was a specimen of the tickets used by the jockeys at the material time. The burden is on the defendants to prove that the ticket issued to the plaintiff contained this condition and they have not discharged this burden. I accordingly find that the portion of the ticket issued to the plaintiff did not bear the condition as alleged by the defendants.
 The first issue: Whether the jockey who parked the car for the plaintiff was at the material time a servant or agent of the defendants
In connection with the first issue I have already found that the jockeys were not employed by the defendants, but by Lim, an independent contractor. This finding supports the submission made by counsel for the defendants that as Lim was an independent contractor engaged by the defendants to provide jockeys for the car parking service, the defendants cannot be held responsible for any act or omission of the jockeys and are therefore not liable to the plaintiff for the loss of the car, even if the loss was caused by the negligence of the jockeys. In support of his argument, counsel relied on the following passage of the judgment of Slesser LJ in 
 Honeywill & Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers (London`s Commercial Photographers) Ltd 
, at p 196: 
 
It is well established as a general rule of English law that an employer is not liable for the acts of his independent contractor in the same way as he is for the acts of his servants or agents, even though these acts are done in carrying out the work for his benefit under the contract.
 
 
 
In that case, the plaintiffs who were specialists in acoustic work were anxious to have photographs taken of the interior of a cinema where they had done some work, and they engaged the defendants to take the photographs. In the process of taking the photographs, the defendants through their negligence caused a fire which damaged the stage curtain in the theatre. The plaintiffs paid the amount claimed by the cinema company as the cost of repair and sought to recover that amount from the defendants. It was contended by the defendants that the plaintiffs were not liable to the cinema company as the defendants were independent contractors. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs were liable to the cinema company as the work involved was of a dangerous character which imposed on the plaintiffs an obligation to take special precautions and ensure that the work was properly carried out so as not to cause any damage and that they could not delegate this obligation by having the work performed by an independent contractor.
The circumstances here are in no way near or similar to those in 
 Honeywill & Stein 
, and to that extent that case is of no application here. The broad statement of law relied upon by counsel for the defendants does not really go so far as to say that a person is not responsible, in all circumstances, for the acts of his independent contractor or those of the latter`s servant or agent. 
 Honeywill & Stein 
, is itself an illustration. The issue here is whether in the circumstances of the case, the jockeys though in the general employment of Lim, were at the material time pro hac vice in the employment of the defendants. For, it is a well-recognized principle that a servant in the general employment of A may, for a particular purpose, be treated as being pro hac vice in the employment of B (per Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle in 
 Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Hall Russell & Co Ltd 
, at p 689).
This question arose in the leading case of 
 Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd 
. There, the harbour board let a mobile crane to the stevedores for the purpose of loading a ship and provided a skilled workman, Newall, to operate the crane. In the course of operating the crane, through his negligence he injured a third party, McFarlane. McFarlane sued the stevedores and, in the alternative, the harbour board. From the evidence it appeared that the harbour board had engaged Newall, paid his wages, prescribed the jobs he should undertake and alone had the power to dismiss him. The stevedores had the immediate direction and control of the operations to be executed by him with the crane, eg to pick up and move a piece of cargo from the shed to ship, but had no power to direct how he should work the crane, the manipulation of the controls being a matter for him. The trial judge held that Newall was negligent and the harbour board liable on the ground that Newall was employed by them. The harbour board appealed to the Court of Appeal contending that at the material time Newall was in the employment of the stevedores. The appeal was dismissed. The harbour board further appealed to the House of Lords seeking to have the judgment against them substituted by a judgment against the stevedores on the ground that Newall, at the time of the accident and for the purpose of the operations in which he was then engaged, was the employee or servant of the stevedores. The appeal was dismissed. The House of Lords held that Newall was employed by the harbour board to operate the crane which belonged to them; that they alone had the right or power to control how he was to operate the crane; that they vested in Newall the discretion as to how to operate the crane and were therefore responsible for his negligent operation of the crane which occasioned the damage; that the test for determining whether Newall, at the time the tort was committed, continued to be in the general employment of the harbour board or was in the temporary employment of the stevedores was who had the right or authority to exercise control over how he was to operate the crane, and that the harbour board had not discharged the burden of showing that this right of control was at the material time vested in the stevedores. Viscount Simon said, at pp 9-10: 
 
... What has now to be decided is whether, in applying the doctrine of respondeat superior, liability attaches on these facts to the appellant board as the regular employers of Newall or to the respondent company as the persons who were temporarily making use of the crane which Newall was driving. The appellant board had engaged Newall, and it paid his wages: it alone had power to dismiss him. On the other hand, the respondent company had the immediate direction and control of the operations to be executed by the crane driver with his crane, eg to pick up and move a piece of cargo from shed to ship. The respondent company, however, had no power to direct how the crane driver should work the crane. The manipulation of the controls was a matter for the driver himself. In the present case the accident happened because of the negligent way in which the crane driver worked his crane, and since the respondent company had no control over how he worked it, as distinguished from telling him what he was to do with the crane, it seems to me to follow that Newall`s general employers must be liable for this negligence and not the hirers of the apparatus.
 
 
 
On the proper test to be applied in determining who was the employer of Newall, he said, at p 12: 
 
... I would prefer to make the test turn on where the authority lies to direct, or to delegate to, the workman, the manner in which the vehicle is driven. It is this authority which determines who is the workman`s `superior`.
 
 
 
On this test, Lord Macmillan said, at p 13: 
 
... The stevedores were entitled to tell him where to go, what parcels to lift and where to take them, that is to say, they could direct him as to what they wanted him to do; but they had no authority to tell him how he was to handle the crane in doing his work. In driving the crane, which was the appellant board`s property confided to his charge, he was acting as the servant of the appellant board, not as the servant of the stevedores. It was not in consequence of any order of the stevedores that he negligently ran down the plaintiff; it was in consequence of his negligence in driving the crane, that is to say, in performing the work which he was employed by the appellant board to do.
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by Lord Simonds, at p 18: 
 
... it appears to me that the test can only be satisfied if the temporary employer (if to use the word `employer` is not to beg the question) can direct not only what the workman is to do but also how he is to do it. In the case before your Lordships the negligence of the workman lay not in the performance of any act which the respondents could and did direct and for which, because they procured it, they would be responsible, but in the manner in which that act was performed, a matter in which they could give no direction and for which they can have no responsibility.
 
 
 
In holding the harbour board, the general employer, liable for the tort committed by Newall, the House of Lords also said that if the board could show pro hac vice the workman had become the servant of the stevedores, they would escape liability. Lord Macmillan said, at p 13: 
 
... But it is always open to an employer to show, if he can, that he has for a particular purpose or on a particular occasion temporarily transferred the services of one of his general servants to another party so as to constitute him pro hac vice the servant of that other party with consequent liability for his negligent acts. The burden is on the general employer to establish that such a transference has been effected. ...
 
 
 
Lord Simonds said, at p 18: 
 
... He was engaged and paid and liable to be dismissed by them. So also, when the contract had been performed, he was their servant. If then in the performance of that contract he committed a tortious act, injuring McFarlane by his negligence, they can only escape from liability, if they can show that pro hac vice the relation of master and servant had been temporarily constituted between the respondents and Newall and temporarily abrogated between themselves and him.
 
 
 
The facts in the present case are clearly distinguishable from those in 
 Mersey Docks 
. This is not a case where Lim hired out an equipment together with skilled workers to the defendants. What Lim provided to the defendants was only labour in the form of three to four jockeys every night to attend to the service of parking cars for the customers of the defendants. There is a clear distinction between (i) a case such as 
 Mersey Docks 
, where an equipment is hired out together with a skilled operator and (ii) a case as here where only labour is provided. In the first case, the equipment is that of the general employer and obviously he has the right to tell the workman how to operate the equipment. As Lord Porter in 
 Mersey Docks 
, said, at p 17: 
 
... Where a man driving a mechanical device, such as a crane, is sent to perform a task, it is easier to infer that the general employer continues to control the method of performance since it is his crane and the driver remains responsible to him for its safe keeping.
 
 
 
In the second case, what is `hired out` is merely labour - relatively unskilled labour - and it is easy to infer that the `hirer` has the control or the right of control over what work is to be done as well as 
 how 
 the work is to be done.
Support for this analysis is found in Parker J`s decision in 
 Garrard v Southey & Co 
. There, the plaintiff was an employee of the first defendants, who were contractors in the business of electrical installation. The second defendants took over a factory and workshop which needed rewriting for electric light and power. Under an agreement between the two defendants, the plaintiff and his mates began work at the premises of the second defendants. They remained in the employment of the first defendants, although they worked exclusively at the second defendants` premises and conformed to their hours. The second defendants further supplied them with all the materials, tools, plant and equipment they required save a few of their own tools. The plaintiff was subsequently injured when he fell while climbing a structure within the premises of the second defendants which had completely rotted away. The question was who, at the time of the accident, was the master of the plaintiff and thus owed him the duty to provide proper plant and equipment. In determining this question, Parker J raised the case of 
 Mersey Docks 
, and made a distinction between that case and the one before him, and said, at p 600: 
 
... it seems to me that a distinction is to be drawn between cases such as the 
 Mersey Docks and Harbour Board
 case [1946] 2 All ER 345; 
[1947] AC 1
 where a complicated piece of machinery and a driver are lent, and cases where labour only, and labour not necessarily of a highly skilled character, is lent. In the former case it is easy to infer that the general employer does not intend to permit the hirer to have control over his valuable bit of machinery in the sense of being able to tell the workman how to work it. On the other hand, when it is a matter of not very highly skilled labour, it seems to me much more easy to infer that the hirer should have control not merely in the sense of being able to tell the workman what he wants doing, but also of deciding the manner of doing it.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, Parker J found that, at the time of the accident, a relationship of master and servant had arisen between the second defendants, as the temporary employers, and the plaintiff and consequently the second defendants owed the plaintiff the common law duty to provide proper plant and equipment.
The distinction made in 
 Garrard v Southey 
, was referred to by Denning LJ in 
 Denham v Midland Employers` Mutual Assurance 
. In that case, a company, Eastwoods engaged the contractors, Le Grand, to make test borings on their property and agreed to provide an unskilled worker to assist Le Grand in the performance of their contract. The unskilled worker so provided by Eastwoods was Clegg. In the course of assisting Le Grand`s employees in the performance of their contract, Clegg was killed through the negligence of Le Grand. It was accepted that Le Grand were liable. The question that arose was whether Le Grand were entitled to be indemnified by the insurer under their public liability policy or the insurer (which was a different insurer) under the employers` liability policy. It was held that Clegg was not under a contract of service with Le Grand and accordingly, they were entitled to an indemnity under the public liability policy. In the course of his judgment, Denning LJ made the following observation, at p 564: 
 
... a transfer [of service] rarely takes place when a man is lent with a machine, such as a crane or a lorry: or when a skilled man is lent so as to exercise his skill for the temporary employer. In such case the parties do not contemplate that the temporary employer shall tell the man how to manipulate his machine or to exercise his skill. A transfer does sometimes take place in the case when an unskilled man is lent to help with labouring work: see 
 Garrard v AE Southey & Co & Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd
 [1952] 1 All ER 597; 
[1952] 2 QB 174
. The temporary employer can then no doubt tell the labourer how he is to do the job. The labourer becomes so much part of the organization to which he is seconded that the temporary employer is responsible for him and to him.
 
 
 
Applying these principles to the facts found by the arbitrator, I have myself no doubt that, if a third person had been injured by the negligence of Mr Clegg in the course of his work, then Le Grand would be liable to the third person and not Eastwoods. So also, when Mr Clegg himself was killed, Le Grand are liable to his widow on the same footing as if they were his masters and not merely as invitors. These results are achieved in law by holding that Mr Clegg became for the time being the temporary servant of Le Grand.
It is true that these two cases concern the question of an employer`s duty to his servant and not the question of the vicarious liability of an employer for the acts of his servant. However, there can be no distinction in principle. In 
 Garrard v Southey 
, the question to be decided was who at the material time of the accident was the master of the plaintiff and hence the person who owed him the duty to provide proper plant and equipment. In this case, the question to be decided is who at the material time was the master of the jockeys and the person who would be responsible vicariously for the act of the jockeys. In both cases, liability is established on the basis of finding that pro hac vice the master and servant relationship had arisen.
I now revert to the facts in this case. What Lim hired out to the defendants is neither a piece of machinery nor highly skilled workmen. He provided jockeys who offered to park cars for customers of the defendants` night club. All the equipment or paraphernalia necessary to the operation of the car parking service was provided by the defendants themselves: they provided the table, the key cabinet and the red notice board, and all these were placed near the entrance to the night club - the position where all these were placed appeared to constitute the operation centre for the car parking service. They also provided a system by which the cars parked by the jockeys could be identified, namely, the provision of printed tickets with counterfoils which the jockeys would attach to the car keys. Furthermore, the jockeys were provided with white shirts imprinted with the name of the defendants` night club, thus enabling them to be easily identified for the car parking service. They became (in the words of Denning LJ) so much part of the organization of the defendants that the latter were responsible for them and to them and also for their acts or omissions. While Lim has testified that he told the jockeys how to perform the service, I am unable to accept his evidence at face value; it appears to me to be too contrived for the purpose of the defence. I also do not accept his evidence that he went to the night club to see how the jockeys performed their service. He might have gone there initially when he first provided these jockeys, but I do think that he went there regularly or frequently. There was no evidence that he did. It seems to me that the obligation of Lim was merely to hire a pool of jockeys for the defendants but these jockeys really worked for the defendants` night clubs, and the management of the night club gave them the necessary instructions, had overall control over them and had the right to dictate the manner and mode of their parking the cars of their customers. I am not persuaded that there was anything that prevented or could have prevented the defendants from telling the jockeys how they were to perform the service. In my opinion, the jockeys were pro hac vice the servants or agents of the defendants in providing a car parking service to the customers of the night club.
 The second issue: Whether there was, at the material time, a relationship between the plaintiff as the bailor and the defendants as the bailees in relation to the car
The system by which the car parking service was performed by the jockeys at the defendants` night club was this. Customers of the defendants` night club would drive up to the front porch of the Orchard Building. There, the jockeys waited in attendance and offered to park the cars. The customers, if they required the car parking service, would hand their cars and the keys (to their cars) to the jockeys who would then issue tickets to them whilst retaining the counterfoils. The customers were not concerned with where their cars would be parked. The jockeys would take the cars and park them in the public car park and attach the car keys to the counterfoil of the tickets, and place them in the key cabinet. To retrieve their cars, the customers would present their tickets to the jockeys, who would then locate the cars and drive them to the customers. In my opinion, on each occasion when a customer delivered the car or the key to the car to the jockey in attendance, he delivered possession of the car to the jockey and such delivery was made upon an implied trust that the jockey would park the car and subsequently retrieve the car for the customer upon the presentation of the ticket. The jockey pro hac vice was, as I have held, the servant or agent of the defendants. Hence, in the present case, on the night in question, when the plaintiff handed the key to his car to a jockey and in exchange received the ticket No 16757, the jockey took possession of the car as the servant or agent of the defendants, and thus there arose a relationship between the plaintiff as bailor and the defendants as the bailees of the car.
It was contended by counsel for the defendants that there was no delivery of possession of the car to the servants or agents of the defendants, as the mere handing over by a customer of his car to the jockey for the purpose of parking it in a public car park did not give rise to a delivery of possession. In support, counsel relied on 
 Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd 
, and 
 Maritime Coastal Containers Ltd v Shelburne Marine Ltd 
. In the first case, the House of Lords held, inter alia, that the stevedores who negligently dropped a drum containing chemicals while lowering it from an upper floor of a dock transit shed onto a lorry were not bailees of the drum. In the second case, Hallet J in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court held that the defendant shipyard who had, at the shipowner`s request, unloaded 40 tons of steel from the ship and placed them on some adjoining property, was not liable as a bailee for the loss of the steel since there had been no bailment arising from the unloading of the steel. However, in both these cases, there could not have been a delivery of possession of the goods in question as there was in the instant case. The stevedores in 
 Scruttons 
, and the shipyard in 
 Maritime 
, were merely performing the limited function they had contracted to do, which was to load and unload goods from a ship. In the performance of that function, there was no need for the delivery of the goods on trust or contract with the expectation that the goods would be redelivered. The situations that arose in these cases are therefore quite unlike the instant case where possession and control was taken of the plaintiff`s car by the jockey as a necessary corollary to the car parking service provided by the defendants. It is inconceivable that a customer such as the plaintiff would not expect that, in order for a jockey to carry out the function of parking the car for him, he would have to surrender in the interim possession and control of the vehicle to the jockey.
In the case of 
 Shorters Parking Station Ltd v Johnson 
, the plaintiff`s representative had been regularly parking his car at the defendant`s premises for reward. The consideration for parking the car there was Â£5 per month. Normally, the defendant housed the car in a covered car parking building but not in any fixed position. For this purpose, on arrival the driver was either directed to a position by an attendant or the car was simply left for the attendant to park the car later at a position of his own choice, but always the key was left in the ignition switch so that the defendant`s servants could move the vehicle when required. On the occasion that gave rise to the dispute, the plaintiff`s representative drove the car to the defendant`s basement and left it there with the key in the ignition switch. A thief stole the car from the spot where the attendant eventually parked the car. The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligence and it was held that in the particular circumstances the defendant was a bailee for reward and possession of the car had been delivered to them. They were therefore liable to make good the loss suffered by the plaintiff. The argument on appeal was that there had been no delivery of possession for any purpose other than the plaintiff`s own purposes and hence there was no evidence from which an intention of creating a bailment could be inferred. Hardie Boys J in the Supreme Court of Auckland on the basis of two decisions in Canada held that where there had been a delivery of a customer`s key (to the car) to the attendant in charge of the parking lot, there was a delivery of the car such as to make the proprietor of the parking lot a bailee and liable accordingly. There was actual delivery of possession by the plaintiff of his car to the defendant`s servant and his intention was that the defendant`s servant would keep it in safe custody.
The two Canadian decisions which were followed by Hardie Boys J were 
 Appleton et al v Ritchie Taxi 
, and 
 Way Sagless Springs Co Ltd v Bevradio Theatres Ltd 
. Both were decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In the first case, the plaintiff had left the car with the key in place in the charge of the attendant of the defendants` parking premises, and on payment of a small fee had been given a ticket. The car was subsequently taken from the lot by an unauthorized person and left abandoned. The plaintiff sued for the damage to the car and the loss of items he had in the car. Gillanders JA found that possession of the car had been delivered to and accepted by the defendants for safe custody and that a bailment relationship had arisen such that the defendants were liable for the damage. In 
 Way Sagless Springs 
, the defendants ran a theatre and invited their patrons to park their cars without charge at a parking lot operated in connection with their theatre. The plaintiff left his car with the defendants` servant and at his request, left the key in the car. The defendants` servant negligently left the key where a thief would expect to look for it, as a result of which the plaintiff`s car was stolen. Henderson JA found that the defendants were liable for the loss of the car.
In each of these cases, there was a delivery of possession of the car to the parking attendant concerned. This is directly applicable to the instant case where the plaintiff had left his car at the front porch and had given his key to a jockey in order for the latter to park his car. In my judgment, there was delivery of possession of the car to the jockey, the servant or agent of the defendants, and thus the relationship of the plaintiff as bailor and the defendants as bailees arose.
Before turning to the next main issue, there are two questions which need to be addressed. The first is whether it is material that the plaintiff`s car was parked in a public car park and not in a car park controlled or managed by the defendants. In my opinion, the duty of a bailee does not depend on whether the chattels, the subject of a bailment, are stored or kept in his own premises or elsewhere. The essence of bailment is the delivery of the chattels upon a trust on a contract under which the bailee undertakes to take reasonable care of the chattels and to redeliver them according to his agreement with the bailor. Possession of the chattels during the period of bailment lies with the bailee, irrespective of the premises in which the chattels are stored, and the bailee must fulfil his obligation to take reasonable care of the chattels. The fact that he stores the chattels in some place not within his control or management would necessarily entail that he has to take reasonable care to ensure that the chattels are properly secured against theft or damage.
The next question is whether the bailment is one for reward or gratuitous. It was submitted by counsel for the defendants that if there was a bailment it was a gratuitous bailment, as there was no fee charged by the defendants in provision of such parking service to their customers. I disagree. To constitute a bailment for reward it is not necessary that there should be an immediate or direct tangible benefit or advantage, such as payment of a fee to the bailee. In this case, the defendants owned and operated the night club and provided car parking service to their customers for which no charge or fee was levied; but that was part of the services they provided to their customers for coming to the night club. There is no doubt that they derived some benefit or advantage in the form of increased patronage to the night club. There would be no reason why the defendants would want to pay $1,000 a month for the provision of a gratuitous service to their customers unless they thought that it had some benefit to the night club. In my opinion, the bailment in this case is one for reward and it can in no way be said to be a gratuitous bailment. In the case of 
 Murphy v Hart 
, a restaurateur, in whose custody clothing or other articles were deposited temporarily as an incident to his general business was held liable as an ordinary bailee for reward for any loss resulting from negligence. Harris CJ said at p 38: 
 
The depositing of the overcoat in the place provided by the defendant for that purpose was for the benefit of both parties, and while no price was paid directly or specifically to the defendant for the care of the plaintiff`s overcoat, it was part of the accommodation for which the defendant received his recompense from his customers. It is obvious that the defendant derived some advantage in the way of increased trade by making his premises attractive and the providing of a place in which customers could leave their coats and hats while eating was a necessary incident to the business just as it is in the case of a barber shop, or a bathing house.
 
 
 
On principle I do not see why the defendant is not a bailee for hire quite as much as he would be if paid a specific sum for the care and custody of the plaintiff`s coat.
The instant case is similar to that in 
 Way Sagless Springs 
 where the theatre also provided a free parking service for its patrons.
It was pointed out by counsel for the defendants that 
 Murphy v Hart 
, was not followed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 
 Martin v Town N` Country Delicatessen Ltd 
. That is true. But the facts in the latter case were different. There, the plaintiff with his wife and some friends went to the defendant`s restaurant for dinner. The defendant owned two parking lots, one immediately next to the restaurant and the second across the lane. The plaintiff was quite familiar with the parking lots as he had been a frequent customer at the defendant`s restaurant. On the night in question the plaintiff drove his vehicle to the parking lot nearest to the restaurant but as the lot was filled with cars and there was no parking space available for him, he drove his car into one of the aisles between the rows of cars. Ordinarily there was no attendant at these parking lots and the customers parked their cars themselves. However, sometimes on special occasions the defendant would retain one or more attendants for the purpose of maintaining a semblance of order in the parking lots. On the night in question a person, whom the plaintiff presumed to be an attendant, suggested to the plaintiff to leave his car at the aisle with the key in it agreeing to park the car for him when a parking lot became available. The plaintiff accordingly left the key in his car, and with his party went into the restaurant for dinner. At the end of the evening when the plaintiff went to collect his car, he found that it was missing and he was unable to locate the person with whom he had previously left the car. The car had been stolen. It was held that there was no bailment created by the plaintiff leaving his car at the defendant`s parking lot which was provided as a courtesy to its customers, and the relationship between the restaurateur and the customer was that of a licensor and licensee and no liability rested on the restaurateur for the loss or damage to the car. Miller CJM said at p 453: 
 
To make the defendant liable in the case before us, the plaintiff must establish bailment. I agree with the learned trial judge that this was not a case of bailment but, if it were, it would be a gratuitous bailment. Bailment is delivery of personal chattels in trust on a contract, express or implied, that the trust will be duly executed and the chattels redelivered as agreed. I cannot see any contract here, either express or implied, to accept the plaintiff`s car in trust. The facilities of the parking lot were made available gratuitously for the convenience of the plaintiff and others desirous of using the restaurant and arriving by car. The supply of a parking lot for the convenience of patrons was not a service covered by a consideration paid by patrons of the restaurant. Presumably the same prices would be charged people who walked to the restaurant, or who came by bus or taxicab, without any consideration for the furnishing of a parking lot for motorists. It would surely not be a bailment for reward and, even if it were a gratuitous bailment, the defendant was not guilty of gross negligence or fraud and therefore would not be liable for the plaintiff`s car. 
 Martin
 12 is of no assistance here. There was undoubtedly no bailment in that case; the car parks were provided for the use of the customers and the customers had to park their own cars. No tickets were issued and no attendants were provided to park the cars for any customers.
 
 
 
At any rate, in my opinion, it is not material in this case whether the bailment was one for reward or gratuitous, and this will be apparent when I deal with the issue of negligence or breach of duty as a bailee. In the case of a bailment for reward the duty of the bailee is to take reasonable care of the goods bailed, and in the case of a gratuitous bailment, the duty of the bailee is to take such care as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods. The difference between the two standards of care is very fine. In 
 Port Swettenham Authority v TW Wu & Co (M) Sdn Bhd 
, Lord Salmon, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, compared the effect of ss 104 and 105 of the Contracts (Malay States) Ordinance of 1950 with the position at common law in relation to bailments and said, at p 589: 
 
It is true that Malaysian law sets a single standard of care for all bailees - whether they are bailees for reward or gratuitous bailees - and it corresponds to the standard required of a gratuitous bailee at common law [
 viz to take as much care as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods
]. This standard, although high, may be a less exacting standard than that which the common law requires of a bailee for reward. But the line between the two standards is a very fine line, difficult to discern and impossible to define. After all, a man of ordinary prudence would presumably take reasonable care of his own goods. However this may be, there is no doubt that under Malaysian law interpreted in the light of the common law, ..., the onus is on the bailee to show that he has taken the care required by the law, of the goods entrusted to him.
 
 
 
Later, his Lordship having expressed his grave doubts on the correctness of the decision in 
 Giblin v McMullen 
, continued, at p 589: 
 
There is no compelling authority that a gratuitous bailee who fails to return the goods left in his custody is not obliged to explain why he is not able to return them and to show that their loss is not due to his failure to have taken as much care of the goods as a man of ordinary prudence would have taken of his own goods in similar circumstances. In any event, a bank, which offers its customers, in the ordinary course of business, the service of looking after goods deposited with it, can hardly be described as a gratuitous bailee. The bank must realize that were it to refuse a customer such a service it would probably lose the customer who would have no difficulty in finding another bank which would be happy to render the service which is normally offered by banks to their customers.
 
 
 
I find this passage of the judgment extremely apposite in meeting the argument made on behalf of the defendants that the bailment was gratuitous as no fee was charged for the car parking service.
 The third issue: If there was a bailor and bailee relationship, whether the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailee
I now turn to the issue of negligence or breach of duty on the part of the defendants. It was not disputed that the plaintiff had handed to a jockey the key to his car at or near the front porch of the Orchard Building at about 11pm on 4 April 1985 and was given the ticket in exchange. Thereafter, all that was known was that neither the key nor the car could be located at about 1am on the following morning when the plaintiff left the night club to collect his car. No evidence was adduced by the defendants to indicate any particular cause for the loss of the key or the car; nor was there any evidence that the jockeys had taken precaution to ensure that someone was always in attendance at the key cabinet to ensure that the keys would not be removed by an unauthorized person. There was absolutely no explanation as to how the key could have been missing. In these circumstances, the inference to be drawn is that the key and the car could not have been taken away by an unauthorized person without some lack of care on the part of the jockeys on duty at the time. This is a clear case of res ipsa loquitur. There was no plea of res ipsa loquitur by the plaintiff in the pleadings, but there is no need for a party to plead such an averment in the pleadings: see 
 Bennett v Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd 
. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that in the circumstances of that case the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and there was no requirement to plead it. Davies LJ said, at p 1575: 
 
In my view it is not necessary for that doctrine to be pleaded. If the accident is proved to have happened in such a way that prima facie it could not have happened without negligence on the part of the defendants, then it is for the defendants to explain and show how the accident could have happened without negligence. The defendants made no attempt to do that in this case. In my judgment this is really a classic case of res ipsa loquitur.
 
 
 
In my judgment, the defendants were negligent or in breach of duty as the bailee, and this is still my conclusion even if the defendants were gratuitous bailees.
 The fourth issue: Whether the defendants were relieved from liability by reason of the condition on the notice board and/or the condition on the reverse side of the ticket issued to the plaintiff
I have held that the ticket issued by the jockey to the plaintiff in exchange for the key to his car did not contain any condition and hence no issue arises with reference to the ticket. However, I have found that the defendants, at all material times, had displayed the red notice board above the key cabinet near the entrance to the defendants` night club. The condition appearing on the red notice board (which I have earlier set out) has the effect of excluding any liability of the defendants for negligence or breach of duty. The question is whether the defendants had done all that was reasonable to bring this exclusion clause to the attention of the plaintiff so that it became a term of the bailment. Counsel for the defendants submitted that the defendants had indeed done so and relied on 
 Hood v Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd 
, in support. In that case, the plaintiff was the passenger on a steamship and sustained personal injuries during the voyage and the steamship company relied on the exclusion clause contained in the ticket. The steamship company was found to have done all that was necessary to bring the exclusion clause in question to the attention of the passengers as they had given passengers their tickets enclosed in envelopes which carried a notice on the face thereof requesting passengers to read the conditions of the contract. In the envelope given to the plaintiff was the ticket with a printed notice on its face stating that it was issued subject to conditions set out there which contained, among other things, the exclusion clause. There was little else the defendants in that situation could have done to bring the exclusion clause to the attention of the passengers.
The case before me is entirely different. The condition on the red notice board was placed above the key cabinet some distance from the entrance. The evidence of the plaintiff was that it was 15m away and the evidence of Ms Kwan was that it was 5 or 6ft away. I think that the testimony of both the witnesses was too extreme. I think that looking at the photographs, the distance would probably be about 10 to 15ft from the entrance. Even if the notice board was about 5 or 6ft from the entrance, the defendants would still have to show that it was visible from the position where the plaintiff handed his key to the jockey. There was no evidence as to the state of lighting where the red notice board was placed. Further, a customer arriving at the night club for entertainment and drinks would not be expected to stop to read the notice board placed at the side of the entrance. It was further pointed out that the red notice board was placed at an unusual height, fairly far away from the usual flow of traffic, whether human or vehicular and was of rather small size. I find it highly unlikely that any customer of the defendants such as the plaintiff would have noticed or seen the notice board when they left the cars with the jockeys for parking. In these circumstances, the defendants have failed to show that the contents of the red notice board had been brought to the notice of the plaintiff at the material time and was a term of the bailment.
There are two cases cited by counsel for the plaintiffs which reinforce the conclusion I have reached. The first is 
 Mendelssohn v Normand Ltd 
, where the Court of Appeal found that a condition displayed on the reception desk of the defendant garage could not be seen by the driver when he brought his car to the garage but only when he came back to collect it or to pay the parking charge. That being the case, the notice was not incorporated into the contract `unless it was brought home to the party so prominently that he must have taken to have known of it and agreed to it`. Since the garage company did not prove that the plaintiff knew of the terms of the notice and agreed to it, they could not rely upon it to absolve themselves from liability for the loss of the valuables the plaintiff had left in his car which he had left in the garage.
The second case is 
 Kua Lee Ngoh v Jagindar Singh t/a Speedway Station 
. There, the defendants had two exemption notices placed in two prominent and visible portions respectively of the defendants` premises but the trial judge accepted the evidence of the plaintiff`s husband that he had not seen them and that the defendants` servants or agents had not brought them to his attention. It is significant that in that case the plaintiff`s husband had been sending the vehicle to the defendants` premises for servicing for over a year and yet it was held that the defendants had not established that the exemption notices were brought to the attention of the plaintiff`s husband.
On this issue, I would respectfully refer to and adopt the following passage of the judgment of Denning LJ in 
 Harling v Eddy 
, at p 748: 
 
The principle which underlies these cases is this: if a person wishes to exempt himself from a liability which the common law imposes on him, he can only do it by an express stipulation brought home to the party affected and assented to by him as part of the contract. The party who is liable at law cannot escape liability by simply putting up a printed notice, or issuing a printed catalogue, containing exempting conditions. He must go further and show affirmatively that it is a contractual document and accepted as such by the party affected: see

 The fifth issue: The measure of damages
 
I now come to the assessment of damages. The first and most important item is the value of the car at the material time. The plaintiff claims $70,000 as the value of the car at the time. The car was a BMW 320 automatic and the plaintiff had it for less than one year before the incident. There was evidence that BMW cars were highly popular at the time and there were not many individual sellers in the market for BMW cars of less than one year old. The insured value of the car was $85,000. Zakaria Abdul Kadir, a licensed appraiser, expressed the opinion that the value of the plaintiff`s car was $70,000, and there was no contrary evidence that this value was wrong or excessive. It does not appear to me to be excessive. I therefore accept the sum of $70,000 as the true value of the car.
As for the various items of personal effects in the boot of the car, I disallow the plaintiff`s claim for $3,000 representing the total value of his attache case, a Dupont pen and an Omega watch, as he has not satisfied me why he should have left these items in the boot of his car when he went to the night club. I also disallow (i) the claim for $500 as the value for his drawings and office documents, and (ii) the claim of $200 representing the value of T-shirts, shorts, towels and squash bags. I am not satisfied that the costs of replacing the drawings and documents would be anywhere near the region of $500. As for the claim of $200, the amount seems to me to be much too exaggerated for those items. I allow a sum of $650 representing a reasonable sum for the value of squash racquets and sports shoes.
As regards the loss of the use of his car I would allow a reasonable period and in this case, I think a period of 15 days would be reasonable, and I allow a sum of $1,020 on the basis of the rates given by the plaintiff.
In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $71,670, and in exercise of my discretion I award interest at 4% on that sum from 28 August 1985 to the date of judgment. I also order that the defendants pay the costs of these proceedings.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 2 January 1992 the appellant, having discharged two counsel in succession and being then unrepresented, pleaded guilty to 12 charges punishable under the previous s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 322) (`the Act`), ie for having in his possession for sale various goods marked with a counterfeit trade mark. He also pleaded guilty to 13 charges under the new s 73, which came into operation on 1 March 1991. Nine other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. These were all private prosecutions. The appellant admitted that he had failed to heed the successive summonses brought against him. He would engage counsel and claim trial when he was charged in court, then fail to appear in court on the trial date, for which warrants of arrest were issued with no bail granted, to no avail. Eventually he only appeared in court on the day of his plea of guilt because he had been remanded under a committal order for violating an injunction issued against him. Prosecuting counsel pressed for a deterrent sentence. The appellant asked for leniency and said that he had committed the offences because he and his family needed money, and that he had no money to pay any fine.
He was fined the maximum of $2,000 on each of the 12 charges under the old s 73, amounting to a total of $24,000, with a default term of imprisonment of one month for every $1,000 remaining unpaid, ie a total of 24 months, to run consecutively. For the 13 charges under the new s 73, in respect of which 299 infringing items were involved, he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of between one and six months for each charge, based on a formula tagged to the number of articles stated in each charge (one month`s imprisonment for ten articles or less, two months` imprisonment for 11 to 20 articles, etc), making a total of 32 months` imprisonment. All these sentences were ordered to run consecutively as each of the charges was in respect of a separate and distinct offence, all of which were originally scheduled to be tried at different trials. The appellant was unable to pay the fine of $24,000 and therefore faced a period of 56 months` imprisonment. In Magistrate`s Appeal No 5 of 1992 he appealed against these sentences as being manifestly excessive.
On 24 February 1992 the appellant pleaded guilty to another 27 charges, 19 of them under the old s 73 and eight under the new s 73. 1,683 infringing items comprising at least 12 different varieties of goods were involved. In respect of the 19 charges under the old s 73, he was fined varying amounts making a total of $26,800, with a total default imprisonment term of 19 months and 29 days. In respect of the eight charges under the new s 73, he was again fined varying amounts making a total of $39,800 with a total default imprisonment term of 12 months and 24 days. Nine similar charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence. The appellant was unable to pay the fines and therefore faced imprisonment for a total period of 32 months and 23 days. In Magistrate`s Appeal No 66 of 1992 he contended that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
On 22 April 1922 the appellant pleaded guilty to six charges under the current s 73, with 40 similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. He was fined a total of $25,900, with a default term of imprisonment of seven months. He does not appeal against the sentences imposed on this occasion but refers to them in support of his contention that the sentences on the two previous occasions were manifestly excessive.
The previous s 73 read as follows: 
 
Any person who imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or any purpose of trade or manufacture any goods or things with a counterfeit trade mark affixed to or impressed upon the goods or things or to or upon any case, package or other receptacle in which such goods or things are contained, shall ... be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.
 
 
 
The new s 73 reads as follows: 
 
Any person who imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or thing to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied, shall ... be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the counterfeit trade mark is applied or the registered trade mark is falsely applied (but not to exceed in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
The main argument of counsel for the appellant was that in meting out the disputed sentences the respective magistrates had ignored the principle of totality. In other words, in sentencing the appellant on each charge, they had failed to consider whether the overall sentence was in keeping with the scale of his misconduct as a whole. The total length of imprisonment the appellant faces in both appeals is seven years four months and 23 days.
I have listened to counsel for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor. There is no doubt that there are many factors which aggravate the appellant`s culpability, including the diversity, scale and persistence of his operations as well as his patent disregard of process. The amendment in the penalties attached to contraventions of s 73 is a clear indication of the legislature`s intent and concern. In my opinion the magistrates were not wrong to take a stern view of the appellant`s conduct. Nevertheless, I am of the view that in all the circumstances, seven years four months and 23 days is a manifestly excessive period for the appellant to be incarcerated for the offences he was sentenced for. Section 73 itself only provides for a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years.
The mischief in these cases has arisen through the use of sentences of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine. The individual fines imposed were not unreasonable, nor were they excessive in aggregate. In Magistrate`s Appeal No 5 of 1992, the default sentences of two months` imprisonment for each $2,000 not paid were in themselves unobjectionable. Yet cumulatively these amounted to a total of 24 months` imprisonment. In the same way, in Magistrate`s Appeal No 66 of 1992, the individual default sentences for each fine were not said to have been excessive, and yet they added up to 32 months and 23 days by reason of the sheer number of charges for which the appellant was sentenced.
In 
 Kanagasuntharam v PP 
 ,1 the Court of Criminal Appeal said that the direction given in s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code, though mandatory, was limited. When exercising its discretion as to which sentences should run consecutively, the sentencing court ought to have regard to the one transaction rule and the totality principle. In particular the following quotation from the judgment of the court is relevant for present purposes: 
 
... a sentencing court ought to have regard to the totality principle which requires the court to review the sentence and consider whether the aggregate is just and appropriate.
 
 
 
Later on in its judgment the court quoted with approval the following passage from DAThomas in 
 Principles of Sentencing 
 (2nd Ed): 
 
The many decisions of the court in which the totality principle has been applied to suggest the reduction of a cumulative sentence made up of correctly calculated individual parts suggest that the principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.
 
 
 
The court went on to recognize that the first limb of this principle had to be qualified in its application to Singapore where s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code was applicable, because to give full effect to the totality principle would in some circumstances be to frustrate the purpose of s 18. Bearing these considerations fully in mind, I am of the view that to give effect to all the default sentences in the present case would offend the totality principle. The question now is as to the proper sentence to be imposed.
It appears that at the time of the first hearing the court was told that the appellant would not be able to pay any fine. It is unclear whether this fact was also placed before the court at the second hearing. Default terms of imprisonment are intended to prevent evasion of the payment of fines imposed, not to punish those who are genuinely unable to pay. When it is unambiguously clear that a defendant cannot pay a fine, realistic and reasonable though it may be, the fine should not be imposed even though the court would have preferred to impose a fine rather than a short term of imprisonment. I am aware that it is frequently a difficult matter for the court to decide whether or not a defendant will in truth be unable to come up with the money to pay a fine. In these cases, although the court is not entitled to assume that he will be able to do so, a default sentence may nonetheless be proper.
In the present appeals, it is clear that the appellant is unable to pay any fine commensurate with the gravity of his offences so it would be invidious to persist in imposing one. Moreover the consecutive imprisonment terms for the 13 charges under the new s 73 in Magistrate`s Appeal No 5 of 1992 were in my view also too harsh. Accordingly, although I affirm the terms of imprisonment imposed by the magistrate for each of the 13 charges under the new s 73 only the sentences for PSS 716/91 (six months), 555/91 (two months), 554/91 (four months) are to run consecutively; the sentences in respect of the remaining ten charges are to run concurrently. In respect of the 12 charges under the old s 73, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment of two months for each, all to run concurrently with the sentence for PSS 716/91. This would mean a total of 12 months` imprisonment for the charges in Magistrate`s Appeal No 5 of 1992.
In Magistrate`s Appeal No 66 of 1992, I would impose a sentence of imprisonment of two months for each of the 19 charges under the old s 73. In respect of the eight charges under the new s 73, I would impose the following sentences of imprisonment: PSS 374/91, two weeks; PSS 343/91, three months; PSS 344/91, two months; PSS 682/91, four months; PSS 683/91, five months; PSS 684/91, two months; PSS 526/91, two months; PSS 30/92 - first charge: five months, fourth charge: six months, sixth charge: four months, ninth charge: six months, tenth charge: three months. The sentences for PSS 682/91 (four months), PSS 683/91 (five months) and the fourth and ninth charges in PSS 30/92 (six months each) are to run consecutively and all other sentences are to run concurrently. This would mean a total of 21 months` imprisonment for the charges in Magistrate`s Appeal No 66 of 1992.
The orders of the respective magistrates are varied accordingly.

s 182 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
Both appellants pleaded guilty to a single charge each under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), of giving false information to a public servant, the Medical Director of the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service, in their respective donor registration forms, knowing it to be likely that they would thereby cause the said public servant to receive a blood donation from them, which the said public servant ought not to have done if the true state of affairs were known to him. They were each sentenced to a week`s imprisonment and a fine of $800. Having paid their fines, they now appeal against these sentences as being manifestly excessive.
The facts relating to the first appellant are as follows. He is a regular helper at the Singapore Red Cross and a regular blood donor, having given blood 17 times before the occasion relevant to the charge. On 28 June 1991 he went to the Red Cross Blood Centre for his lunch break, as he was wont to do, without any intention of giving blood. Only the staff were present and the receptionist asked the appellant to donate blood as there were no other donors that day. The appellant agreed, filled in a donor registration form and went into the blood donation room. On being asked, he confirmed to the duty medical officer that the answers given by him in the questionnaire were all correct and he signed the donor registration form in the duty medical officer`s presence. His blood was received for donation and two weeks later, it was tested HIV (Human Immuno-deficiency Virus) positive. On 8 July 1991 he was referred to the Department for Communicable Diseases at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In an interview with the medical consultant, he said that he had had unprotected sexual intercourse (ie without using a condom) with a woman in Thailand in May 1991. On the donor registration form, question 13 reads as follows: `Have you had unprotected sex (ie sex without using a condom) with a prostitute or a sexual partner 
 other than 
 your usual sexual partner during the last six (6) months?` The first appellant had answered this question `No`, as he had done all the other questions on the form.
The second appellant was not a regular blood donor but had in the past donated blood twice, once in 1987 and again in 1989, on specific occasions when it was needed by someone known to him. On 22 May 1991 a client telephoned his employer at the office, saying that the client`s brother had been involved in a road accident and urgently needed blood. The second appellant`s employer was then out of town. When Teo answered in response to the client`s question that he had given blood before, the client urgently pleaded with him to donate blood to the brother. As he had an appointment shortly, the second appellant went immediately to the National Blood Centre and told the nurse at the counter that he was there to donate blood to the accident victim. Somewhat hurriedly, he filled in a donor registration form and donated his blood. About two weeks later, his blood was tested HIV positive. On 24 July 1991 he was referred to the Department for Communicable Diseases at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In an interview with the medical consultant, he said that he was homosexual. Sometime in 1990 he had had a physical relationship with another male person. On the donor registration form, question 14 reads as follows: `If male, have you engaged in any sexual activity with another male since 1978?` The second appellant had answered this question `No`, as he had done all the other questions on the form.
In the court below and before me, the following considerations have been most strongly urged by counsel for the appellant. First, neither appellant acted with malice on the relevant occasions, but on the contrary reacted generously or compassionately to specific requests to donate blood, not knowing that they themselves were infected. Secondly, neither appellant has a criminal record and both co-operated fully with the police and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. Thirdly, the first appellant filled in his donor registration form as a matter of course and habit, and the second appellant did so in a hurry and in circumstances of urgency. For neither of them did personal gain operate as an active incentive to lie. Fourthly, the appellants were not charged with an AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) related offence under the recent amendments to the Infectious Diseases Act (Cap 137), which came into force on 1 April 1992. Instead they were merely charged with the relatively minor offence of giving false information to a public servant under s 182 of the Penal Code. Fifthly, no serious consequences had occurred, for the blood samples were sent for screening and the infected blood destroyed. Sixthly, and this was most ardently urged, both appellants have already suffered enough. It was argued that the stigma attached to HIV and AIDS, the publicity given to their cases, the ensuing persecution, the isolation and infamy imposed on the appellants by society at large, and the irremediably lethal nature of their affliction was quite sufficient punishment for them to bear. Furthermore, it was said that they should not be incarcerated with common criminals as they needed special care and attention.
The learned district judge sentenced the appellants to a term of imprisonment on the basis of deterrence. It was in the public interest, and the offences in each case were distinguishable from the usual cases of false information given to the police which resulted in mere inconvenience and annoyance. He held that the maintenance of integrity and trust between the public and the blood bank was valuable and should not be undermined by the present cases.
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that under s 182 of the Penal Code the maximum penalty to which the appellants were liable was six months` imprisonment with a fine. A week`s imprisonment could therefore not be said to be manifestly excessive. I am in agreement with this assertion, and I do not think it can be said in any way that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
The deputy public prosecutor also submitted that under the amended provisions of the Infectious Diseases Act any person who, knowing that he has AIDS or that he has been infected with HIV, donates blood at any blood bank in Singapore, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both. Although this provision was not applicable in the present case, because neither appellant knew that he had AIDS or had been infected with the HIV virus, he argued that it showed that the legislature took a serious view as to the donation of infected blood, and was concerned to ensure that blood donations and transfusions were absolutely safe.
For my part, though I am aware of the very strong emotions that underlie these cases, these are not reasons which can validate a variation in the sentences. It is accepted that a voluntary donation of one`s blood is a commendably noble and civic-conscious act, but I can see no reason to treat this case as being any different from any other case under s 182 of the Penal Code which relates to the offence of giving false information to a public servant. In these cases, the appellants gave the false information by giving negative answers to the crucial questions 13 and 14 in the donor registration form when they must have known that the answers were incorrect and the information was false.
The normal sentence imposed for an ordinary offence under s 182 of the Penal Code where the person to be sentenced is a first time offender is a fine of up to $1,000. However s 182 covers an extensive array of misinformation of greatly varying degrees of iniquity and the norm must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, in particular, the mischief that might be caused by the false information. I am in full agreement with the learned district judge as to the importance of encouraging blood donors not to treat the questionnaire in the donor registration form lightly, whatever the circumstances in which they fill in the answers. This questionnaire is an integral part of the screening processes which ensure the safety of our public health services.
The appellants pleaded guilty to an offence which includes as one of its elements the knowledge or belief that the information given by the accused person to a public servant is false. However sympathetic one may be to them in their present plight, the danger inherent in the particular falsehoods given in these cases is sufficient to justify a sentence of some severity. I would have been inclined to impose a considerably more substantial term of imprisonment than one week, and two months would in my opinion have been appropriate. In view of the mitigating factors in these cases, however, I dismiss the appeals and order that the sentence of imprisonment upon each of the appellants be increased to one month.

s 11(1)(c) & (2) Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed)
 
This was an appeal against the decision of the assistant registrar in which he (i) dismissed with costs an application by the Straits Times Press (1975) Ltd (`STP`) for an order to set aside the third party notice issued by the defendant against STP pursuant to an order made on 7 August 1988, or alternatively, for an order to discharge the order of 7 August, and (ii) made an order for third party directions in terms of an application by the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, I dismissed it with costs. I now give my reasons.
On 6 May 1988, one Francis Seow (`FS`) was detained under the Internal Security Act (Cap 143). While under detention he made a statutory declaration on 16 May 1988 which contained, among other things, the following statements: `I look up people like Devan Nair whose opinion and views I felt I could benefit from ... . Sometimes about mid-1987, I called on Devan at his house ... `.
On 20 May 1988 or thereabout the political desk of STP received from the government of Singapore a statement in respect of FS`s detention and excerpts from his statutory declaration. As the involvement of the defendant in the statutory declaration was a newsworthy story, one Leslie Fong, then head of the political desk of STP, directed Bertha Henson, a reporter, to seek an interview with the defendant. Bertha Henson got in touch with the defendant and as a result an interview was arranged which took place at the defendant`s home in the evening of 20 May 1988. Before the interview began, Bertha Henson handed to the defendant copies of the government`s statement and excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration to read. After the defendant had read the documents, Bertha Henson conducted the interview in which the defendant said, among other things, the following: 
 
I recall telling him [Francis Seow] that in doing so, he did nothing exceptional. He was in the distinguished company of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the rest of us, ...
 
 
 
I recall that Mr Lee himself visited establishment and opposition circles in capitals like London, Sydney and Wellington to court goodwill and support for the PAP`s goal of Malaysian Malaysia, ...
On the following day, 21 May 1988, the government`s statement, the excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration and statements made by the defendant at the interview were published in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
. The defendant`s statements were headed with the title `Devan confirmed he gave political advice to Seow`.
The plaintiff responded to the defendant`s comments through his press secretary, James Fu, in a written statement dated 21 May 1988 which was received by STP from the Ministry of Communication and Information. On the following day, an article containing this statement or a substantial portion thereof was published in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 and was entitled in bold print `Devan dishonest in saying Seow did nothing wrong`. The article contained, among other things, the following: 
 
Mr James Fu, press secretary to the Prime Minister, said Mr Nair was dishonest in making those statements.
 
 
 
He said Mr Nair knew that what Seow had done was wrong, especially his contacting US state department officials to seek support and asylum.
In the afternoon of the same day, Leslie Fong`s office received a telephone call from the defendant requesting for someone to collect a statement by the defendant at the latter`s house. Accordingly, Bertha Henson went there and collected the statement. The statement was headed `Response of Devan Nair to the statement of James Fu ( 
 The Sunday Times 
, 22 May 1988)` (`press statement`) and contained, among other things, the following: 
 
Other versions of the history of Singapore`s brief experience as part of Malaysia tell a different story. One of them is that of Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia`s first prime minister, who told me not long ago, that he had all the facts at his disposal to warrant the arrest of Mr Lee when he was the most vociferous member of the Malaysian opposition. ...
 
 
 
... But in courting and sedulously cultivating a whole variety of foreign establishment and opposition circles, we did no more than what Mr Seow is supposed to have done in his meetings with US state department officials, who turned out to be rather small fry. Mr Lee courted far more powerful figures in the countries concerned.
A substantial portion of the press statement was published by STP in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 bearing a large heading `Devan rejects criticism that he was dishonest`. The article contained, among other things, the following: 
 
He reiterated his defence of Seow, first made when he spoke to 
 The Straits Times
 on Friday night, saying that `in courting and sedulously cultivating a whole variety of foreign establishment and opposition circles, we (PAP leaders) did no more than what Seow is supposed to have done in his meetings with state department officials ... `.
 
 
 
These officials `turned out to be rather small fry`, he added. `Mr Lee courted far more powerful figures in the countries concerned.`...
Mr Nair added that the Tunku told him not long ago that he (Tunku) `had all the facts at his disposal to warrant the arrest of Mr Lee when he was the most vociferous member of the Malaysian opposition.`
On 25 May 1988, the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant claiming damages for two alleged libels published by the defendant and an injunction restraining the publication of the alleged libels. The first alleged libel consisted of the words spoken by the defendant on 22 May 1988 which were broadcast and published on the radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The words complained of were: 
 
He [meaning Mr Francis Seow] did not do anything which Lee Kuan Yew and I had done with greater distinction when we were sitting on the opposition benches of the Malaysian Parliament.
 
 
 
The second alleged libel was that passage from the defendant`s press statement which I have earlier set out. After the action had been commenced, pleadings were delivered followed by various interlocutory proceedings.
On 7 April 1989, the plaintiff obtained leave of the court to amend the statement of claim by adding a claim for a third alleged libel which was the passage from the article published by STP on 23 May 1988 in 
 The Straits Times 
 entitled `Devan rejects criticism that he was dishonest`, which I have earlier set out. The plaintiff complained that that passage of the article was libellous of him. Subsequently, amended defence was delivered by the defendant and amended reply was delivered by the plaintiff.
It is in respect of this publication by STP on 23 May 1988 that the defendant seeks an indemnity or contribution from STP. On 7 August 1991, the defendant applied ex parte for leave to issue a third party notice claiming an indemnity or contribution from STP to the extent that the court finds just and equitable under s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed) on the ground that the third alleged libel was published by STP on 23 May 1988 to a wide audience in Singapore. An order was made on the same day, that is, 7 August 1991, for the issue of a third party notice, and thereafter the third party notice was issued and was served on STP.
On 17 October 1991, the defendant took out a summons for third party directions, No 6843 of 1991, which was returnable on 18 November 1991. Prior to the return date, STP took out an application by Summons-in-Chambers No 6848 of 1991, for an order that the third party notice issued pursuant to the order dated 7 August 1991 be set aside or that the order of 7 August authorizing the issue of the third party notice be discharged. That summons was returnable on 6 January 1992. Both the summonses were subsequently fixed for hearing on another date and were heard together before the assistant registrar. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned assistant registrar dismissed the application by STP and made an order for third party directions in terms of the application by the defendant. Against the decision of the learned assistant registrar on both the summonses STP appealed.
The learned assistant registrar has given detailed reasons for his decision, which may be summarized as follows. First, he treated the third party procedure as analogous to a cause instituted by a defendant as the plaintiff against the third party as the defendant with the consequence that the third party may defend himself in any way in which a defendant in an action at the suit of the plaintiff may defend himself. Accordingly, he held that the application by STP to set aside the third party notice at the interlocutory stage was governed by the same principles applicable in an application by a defendant to strike out a statement of claim of the plaintiff under O 18 r 19 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Next, the learned assistant registrar went on to consider whether the defendant had a prima facie case against STP for an indemnity or contribution. In that connection, he considered the contention of STP that as the defendant had authorized the handing of the press statement to STP, the defendant had consented to the publication and that such consent was a defence to the defendant`s claim for an indemnity or contribution. He accepted that in an action for libel consent of the plaintiff to the publication by the defendant of the defamatory material is a defence to the plaintiff`s claim, but he held that the authorities did not go that far as contended on behalf of STP. He was of the opinion that the claim for an indemnity or contribution was not a cause of action founded in tort but was a right sui generis conferred by statute. Though the consent to the publication could well be raised in a claim for an indemnity or contribution, it would not necessarily operate as a complete defence such that STP bore no responsibility whatsoever for any damage and that the claim of the defendant would obviously be unsustainable. The question of apportionment of responsibility between the defendant and STP would necessarily be examined at the trial in the light of all the relevant circumstances. He therefore came to the conclusion that the defendant had established a prima facie case against STP for an indemnity or contribution, and such claim ought to proceed to trial. I agree substantially with the reasoning of the learned assistant registrar, and, but for the fact that counsel for the defendant and STP have argued at great length before me, I would not be disposed to go further.
I turn first to the procedural point raised by both parties. Mr Elias for STP submitted that STP as the third party is entitled to avail itself of any defence available to a defendant in an action by the plaintiff, and third party procedure is analogous to a cause instituted by the defendant as the plaintiff against the third party as the defendant with the consequence that the third party may defend himself in any way in which any defendant in an action at the suit of a plaintiff may defend himself: see 
 Barclays Bank v Tom 
 1 where it was held that a person who had been served with a third party notice was entitled to counterclaim against the defendant. I accepted this submission, and in considering the application by STP I applied the same principles governing the determination of an application by a defendant to strike out the plaintiff`s claim under O 18 r 19 or inherent jurisdiction of the court. In 
 Ronex Properties Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd & Ors 
 ,2 there was an application by the third party for an order striking out the third party notice on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action as the defendants` right to recover contribution was time-barred. The application was dismissed by the judge and on appeal the Court of Appeal dismissed it. The court held that since the statutes of limitation merely barred the remedy and not the cause of action and since a defence of limitation when pleaded might be subject to exceptions, the application to strike out a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action was misconceived. The court went on to say that in a very clear case of time-barred defence with evidence in support the defendant could apply to strike out the claim as frivolous, vexatious and abuse of process of the court.
Mr Loh for the defendant submitted that upon the summons for third party directions the third party proceedings ought not to be set aside or third party directions be refused, unless the third party (or the plaintiff) could show `special circumstances` why directions should not be given. He cited the following passage from 1 
 Supreme Court Practice 1991 
 para 16/4/7: 
 
If a prima facie case under r 1(1)(a) is made out, or if the case is clearly such as is contemplated by (b) or (c) it will be for the plaintiff or third party to show some special circumstances why the direction should not be given.
 
 
 
Order 16 r 1(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court in England referred to in the above passage are in pari materia with corresponding O 16 r 1(a), (b) and (c) of our Rules of the Supreme Court. Mr Loh relied on 
 Courtenay-Evans & Anor 
 
 v 
 
Stuart Passey & Associates (a firm) & Anor
 
[1986] 1 All ER 932
 where the court adopted that statement as correct. In that case, there was considerable delay in taking out third party proceedings and the court considered the delay and the consequences that would arise if the third party proceedings were permitted to proceed as `special circumstances` and dismissed the application for third party directions. However, Mr Elias was not contending that there was any special circumstance but that the defendant had not made out any prima facie case against the third party. Hence, the question of `special circumstances` is irrelevant. I agree.
Mr Elias sought to show that the defendant`s claim against STP for an indemnity or contribution was obviously unsustainable. He referred to 
 Cookson v Harewood 
 4 and 
 Chapman v Lord Ellesmere & Ors 
 5 where it was held that consent previously given by the plaintiff to the publication of defamatory material of him was a defence to a claim for damages for defamation. Mr Elias argued by analogy that the same defence was available to STP in resisting the claim by the defendant for an indemnity or contribution. The publication by STP of the defendant`s press statement in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 was made at the request or with the consent of the defendant, and the publication contained substantially the same content as the press statement. Accordingly, the defendant had no claim against the third party for an indemnity or contribution.
I think it cannot be disputed that when the defendant requested STP to collect the defendant`s press statement, he intended to request STP to publish it in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 or as soon as possible thereafter. The publication of the content of the press statement therefore was made with his consent. Such consent may well be relevant in the defendant`s claim against STP for an indemnity or contribution. But at this stage I am not disposed to hold that the consent is a complete answer to the claim of the defendant. The cases of 
 Cookson v Harewood 
 4 and 
 Chapman v Lord Ellesmere 
 5 certainly did not go that far.
The defendant`s claim for an indemnity or contribution is founded on s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed), which, in so far as material, is as follows: 
 
 
(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) - 
 
... 
 
(c) any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought. 
 
(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person`s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity.
  
 
 
The publication by STP on 23 May 1988 was a republication of the defendant`s press statement. If the press statement is held to be a libel, then the publication by STP is equally a libel. `Every republication of a libel is a new libel, and each publisher is answerable for his act to the same extent as if the calumny originated with him`: see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) p 117. In those circumstances, both the defendant and STP are tortfeasors, and STP clearly `is, or would, if sued, have been, liable in respect of the same damage` as provided in s 11(1)(c); the question of the defendant`s claim for contribution will then arise and the court will under s 11(2) have to determine such amount of contribution as may be found to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of STP`s responsibility.
The next submission of Mr Elias that the defendant has no case against STP for an indemnity or contribution is founded on the later part of s 11(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed), namely: `no person is entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought`. In his submission, STP is entitled to an indemnity from the defendant on two grounds. First, STP published the defendant`s press statement on 23 May 1988 as the agent of the defendant. In support, he relied on 
 R v Cooper 
 ,6 which was a case of criminal defamation. There, the defendant was indicted for publishing, causing and procuring to be published in a newspaper called the 
 Liverpool Chronicle 
 a libel on one Rev Joshua King. At the trial it was proved that the defendant communicated a story of King and his brother to the editor of the newspaper and asked the latter to publish it in the newspaper so as to `shew up` King. The story was published in an article in the newspaper; thereafter the defendant told the editor that he had seen it and that he liked it very much. On those facts, the defendant was found guilty of the charge. Lord Denman CJ said at p 536: 
 
If a man request another generally to write a libel, he must be answerable for any libel written in pursuance of his request: he contributes to a misdemeanor and is therefore responsible as a principal. He takes his chance of what is to be published. Here the defendant first desires the newspaper editor to `shew up` the prosecutor, and communicates to him the particulars of the story which afterwards appears in the newspaper. Having given this general authority, he meets the editor and says that the article has not appeared. That which did in fact form the foundation of the libel, and which the editor communicated to the reporter, was what the defendant communicated to the editor: and, after the publication, it was approved of by the defendant. It is observed that there were additions: but the editor said that what the defendant communicated was substantially what was published. ... I have no doubt that a man who employs another generally to write a libel must take his chance of what appears, though something may be added which he did not state. Here I have not the slightest doubt. There is, first, an employment; secondly, an identity of subject matter; thirdly, a complaint of the delay in the publication; fourthly, an approval; fifthly, evidence that the libel is substantially that which was communicated.
 
 
 
Mr Eilas relied on this passage of the judgment Lord Denman CJ to found his argument that when STP published the defendant`s press statement, the defendant was responsible for that publication as the principal and STP was merely his agent.
Mr Elias relied also on 
 Parkes v Prescott & Anor 
 .7 In that case, at a meeting of a board of guardians there were discussions of the conduct of the plaintiff and defamatory statements of the plaintiff were made. Reporters were also present at the meeting. The defendant E during the meeting expressed the hope that the press would take notice of the `very scandalous case` and requested the defendant P, who was the chairman, to give an outline of the case, which P did. P then also expressed the hope that the press would take notice of it and that publicity would be given to the matter. After the meeting, a correct summary of the proceedings containing matters defamatory of the plaintiff was published in two local newspapers. The plaintiff sued both the defendants for libel. The judge at the trial directed the jury to find for the defendants, holding that there was no evidence of publication. On appeal, his decision was reversed and a new trial was ordered. Montague Smith J, in the course of his judgment, said at pp 177-178: 
 
... loose expressions of a mere wish or hope that proceedings should be published would not be sufficient to fix liability on the defendants in cases like the present. I think the words must be of such a kind, and used in such a manner, as to satisfy the jury that they amounted to, and were in fact, a request to publish. If the words do amount to such a request, and the publication be made in pursuance of it by the persons to whom it was addressed, then it seems to me the persons making such request would be responsible for the libellous matter so published. ...
 
 
 
It is, of course, plain that if a man gives a copy of his speech to another to publish, he is answerable as a publisher. It cannot be contended that he would not be equally answerable if he desired a reporter to take down his speech as he delivered it, and to publish it. ...
... The man who requests another to make and publish an outline or summary of a speech, writing, or proceedings, must know that the words will be to some extent those of him who makes such summary or outline; and he must, therefore, be taken to constitute him an agent for the purpose, and be answerable for the result, subject always to the question whether the authority has been really followed.
He then referred to 
R v Cooper
 
[1846] 8 QB 533
[] 115 ER 976
 and in conclusion said, at p 179: 
 
In the result I come to the conclusion, that on principle it is correct to hold that where a man makes a request to another to publish defamatory matter, of which, for the purpose, he gives him a statement, whether in full or in outline, and the agent publishes that matter, adhering to the sense and substance of it, although the language be to some extent his own, the man making the request is liable to an action as the publisher. If the law were otherwise, it would in many cases throw a shield over those who are the real authors of libels, and who seek to defame others under what would then be the safe shelter of intermediate agents. I make this observation only with reference to the general consequences which would result from the arguments relied on to sustain the defendants` contention.
 
 
 
All that the two cases decided was that where a person has authorized or requested another person to publish any material defamatory of a third party the person who has so authorized or requested it would, for the purpose of such publication and vis-a-vis the third party, be liable for the libel as the principal and the publisher was his agent. Those cases, however, did not decide that as between the person who has authorized or requested the publication and the other person who has published it pursuant to such request, the latter was the agent of the former. In the case before me, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter can be held to be responsible as the principal for the publication of the article in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1992 and, if the words complained of by the plaintiff are held to be defamatory, the defendant would be liable as the person who has authorized the publication. However, as between the defendant and STP there was no relationship of principal and agent. Indeed, there was no contractual relationship at all between them in respect of the publication made by STP on 23 May.
Next, Mr Elias submitted that assuming that when STP published the content of the press statement on 23 May, STP was not the agent of the defendant, STP would nevertheless be entitled to be indemnified by the defendant as it published it at the request of the defendant. He founded his submission on the following broad principle of law: where an act is done by one party at the request of another which act is not manifestly tortious to the knowledge of the person doing it and such act turns out to be injurious to the rights of a third party, the person doing the act is entitled to an indemnity from the other person who requested for the act to be done: 
 Dugdale & Ors v Lovering 
 8 and 
 Lord Mayor & c of Sheffield v Barclay & Ors 
 .9 In 
 Dugdale v Lovering 
 8 the plaintiffs were in possession of certain trucks claimed by the defendant and a third party. The plaintiffs asked the defendant for an indemnity against delivery of the trucks to him. In a subsequent letter the defendant did not reply to the question of indemnity but requested for delivery of the trucks to which the plaintiffs acceded. The third party then claimed against the plaintiffs for conversion; the claim was proved to be well founded and the plaintiffs paid a sum in settlement. They then looked to the defendant for an indemnity. It was held that the defendant was liable to indemnify the plaintiffs. In his judgment, Brett J quoted the following passage of the judgment of Tindal CJ in 
 Toplis v Grane 
 :10 
 
We think this evidence brings the case before us within the principle laid down in 
 Betts v Gibbins
 2 Ad & E 57, that when an act has been done by the plaintiff under the express directions of the defendant which occasions an injury to the rights of third persons, yet if such an act is not apparently illegal in itself, but is done honestly and bona fide in compliance with the defendant`s directions, he shall be bound to indemnify the plaintiff against the consequences thereof. and held that on the facts there arose an implied promise by the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff.
 
 
 
In 
 Lord Mayor & c of Sheffield v Barclay & Ors 
 ,9 the defendant bank forwarded to the corporation transfers of the corporation`s shares with a request for registration and in consequence the registration was effected. Subsequently, it was discovered that one of the transfers was forged and the corporation had to purchase shares and registered them in the name of the true owner. The corporation then sought an indemnity from the bank. The House of Lords held that the bank was liable to indemnify the corporation. The Earl of Halsbury LC in his speech said, at p 397: 
 
In 
 Dugdale v Lovering
 LR 10 CP 196 Mr Cave, arguing for the plaintiff, put the position thus: `It is a general principle of law when an act is done by one person at the request of another which act is not in itself manifestly tortious to the knowledge of the person doing it, and such act turns out to be injurious to the rights of a third party, the person doing it is entitled to an indemnity from him who requested that it should be done.` This though only the argument of counsel was adopted and acted upon by the court, and I believe it accurately expresses the law. ...
 
 
 
... The principle insisted upon by Mr Cave in his argument quoted above has been undoubtedly sanctioned as part of the law by several old decisions, and I think the principle as enunciated is well established.
Lord Davey made a similar pronouncement when he dealt with the duty of the corporation to register the shares; he said at p 399: 
 
...I am further of opinion that where a person invested with a statutory or common law duty of a ministerial character is called upon to exercise that duty on the request, direction, or demand of another (it does not seem to me to matter which word you use), and without any default on his own part acts in a manner which is apparently legal but is, in fact, illegal and a breach of the duty, and thereby incurs liability to third parties, there is implied by law a contract by the person making the request to keep indemnified the person having the duty against any liability which may result from such exercise of the supposed duty. And it makes no difference that the person making the request is not aware of the invalidity in his title to make the request, or could not with reasonable diligence have discovered it.
 
 
 
The proposition of law quoted by Mr Elias is correct but, in my opinion, is not applicable here. Nor are the two cases of any assistance. The factual situation here is entirely different from those present in the two cases. In this case, there is no doubt that in requesting STP to collect his press statement on 22 May and authorizing the delivery thereof to Bertha Henson, the defendant intended what he wrote to be published by STP on the following day or soon thereafter. But the fact remained that whether the press statement should or would be published in 
 The Straits Times 
 and how, when and to what extent it was to be published were matters entirely for STP to decide. As Mr Loh for the defendant said, and I agree with him, STP published it not solely because of the `request` made by the defendant but because STP considered that it constituted a newsworthy story and that the matter was of continuing public interest. Leslie Fong in his affidavit affirmed on 4 November 1991 said: 
 
It was clear to me at the time that the defendant expected STP to accord him the right of reply to James Fu`s statement contained in 
 The Sunday Times
 when his press statement was handed to STP`s reporter. It was also apparent that the defendant authorized the publication of his press statement or excerpts of it by distributing the same to members of the press. As the matter was of continuing public interest, an article quoting substantially the whole of the defendant`s press statement was published in 
 The Straits Times
 on 23 May 1988.
 
 
 
STP was under no obligation to the defendant to publish it - certainly there was no legal obligation to do so. STP had not been requested to publish it in the way that it would have been, had it been a request for publication of an advertisement or letters to the press.
Another argument developed by Mr Elias that STP is entitled to an indemnity is this. The statement in respect of FS`s detention and the excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration issued by the government and the response of the plaintiff released by his press secretary were issued by the government of Singapore and therefore fell within the ambit of para 5 of Pt II of the schedule to the Defamation Act (Cap 75)(`the Act`). In publishing those statements, STP had a defence of qualified privilege under s 12(1) of the Act if sued by the defendant for libel, and in order to maintain such defence STP necessarily had to publish in 
 The Straits Times 
 `a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or contradiction` requested by the defendant. Therefore, when the defendant `requested` STP to publish his press statement, STP did so under s 12(2) of the Act in order to preserve the defence of qualified privilege. In such circumstances, so Mr Elias submitted, the republication by STP was not `illegal` or manifestly tortious, and at law there was an implied contract by the defendant to indemnify STP against any damage sustained by the latter because the republication was made at the defendant`s request.
I am unable to accept this submission. To deal with this point it is helpful to set out in full sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 12 of the Act, which are as follows: 
 
 
(1) Subject to this section, the publication in a newspaper of any such report or other matter as is mentioned in the Schedule shall be privileged unless the publication is proved to be made with malice. 
 
(2) In an action for libel in respect of the publication of any such report or matter as is mentioned in Part II of the Schedule, this section shall not be a defence if it is proved that the defendant has been requested by the plaintiff to publish in the newspaper in which the original publication was made a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or contradiction, and has refused or neglected to do so, or has done so in a manner not adequate or not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.
  
 
 
These provisions, in my opinion, are of no assistance to Mr Elias`s argument. Assuming that the statement of FS`s detention and excerpts from his statutory declaration and the plaintiff`s response released through his press secretary are matters falling within para 5 of Pt II of the schedule and assuming also that the publication by STP of the defendant`s press statement was made pursuant to s 12(2), it was a publication which STP decided to make for its own protection, ie to preserve the qualified privilege in respect of the publication of the materials from the government. The publication also served the interest of STP in other respects: the press statement was obviously a newsworthy item for publication in a newspaper. The decision to publish it rested solely with STP. STP decided to publish it. In these circumstances, it is hardly tenable that an implied contract to indemnify STP arose from the `request` made by the defendant to publish his press statement.
At this stage, I am only concerned with whether there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP for a contribution or indemnity claimed. In my opinion, in the present case, there is certainly a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP to make contribution under s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed). In the old case of 
 Pontifex v Foord 
 11 the defendant, a lessee of certain premises, was sued by the lessor for breach of covenant to repair and he obtained leave to issue a third party notice claiming contribution or indemnity from a sub-lessee. At the hearing for third party directions Field J refused to give directions, and on appeal his decision was affirmed. Pollock B at p 156 said: 
 
... It seems to me that this is no case of contribution or indemnity, and therefore that the learned judge was right in refusing to give directions, and that this appeal must be dismissed. In coming to this conclusion, I do not think we are in any way overruling the decision of the divisional court which gave leave to serve the third party notice. It may be that there was a prima facie case made out for allowing the defendant to serve the notice, but when it comes to be a question of directions, we must then be satisfied that there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of the third party to make the contribution or indemnity claimed.
 
 
 
Similarly, in 
 Baxter v France & Ors 
 12 at p 457 Lord Esher MR said: 
 
... On that summons for directions, the first thing to be considered under the rule, is whether the court or a judge is `satisfied that there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of the third party to make the contribution or indemnity claimed, in whole or in part`. If satisfied of this, the court of a judge `may order the question of liability to be tried`. In this case there must be a summons for directions, and I have not the least doubt of the meaning of the rule being that if, in considering the application, the judge is of opinion that there cannot be any question of contribution or indemnity, he will direct that no such question is to be tried.
 
 
 
These pronouncements are equally applicable here, and I respectfully adopt them. There were two applications before the learned assistant registrar: the application by the defendant for third party directions and the application by STP for setting aside the third party notice or discharging the order for issue of the third party notice. He held that there was a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP to make the contribution or indemnity claimed. I agree entirely with his conclusion.

On 7 July 1992, the respondent, L Edward Epiphany D`Crus, pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to the following charge: 
 
You, L Edward Epiphany D`Crus, M/28 yrs NRIC 1542826, are charged that you, on or about 18 November 1990 at about 2.45pm at the void deck of Blk 13, Bedok South Road, Singapore did have in your possession a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 1.16g (nett) of cannabis, without any authorization under the said Act or Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
The respondent was fined $2,000 with a default term of two months` imprisonment. The drugs were confiscated. On appeal by the public prosecutor, I allowed the appeal. A sentence of two years` imprisonment was substituted. I now give my reasons.
Section 8(a) read together with s 33(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`MDA`) stipulates a minimum sentence of two years` imprisonment where the person found guilty has a previous conviction for that offence. The respondent had a previous conviction for such an offence before a subordinate military court. In the court below, the learned district judge was of the view that the previous conviction before a subordinate military court could not be regarded as a previous conviction for the purpose of sentencing.
There are two issues at hand. The first is the general question whether a conviction before a subordinate military court can be regarded in a civil court (that is, a court of ordinary criminal jurisdiction) as a previous conviction for the purpose of sentencing. The second is specific to the present appeal - whether the MDA allows one to treat a conviction before a subordinate military court for an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA as a previous conviction for the purposes of s 33(2).
On the first issue, the learned district judge was of the view that a conviction before a subordinate military court could not be regarded as a previous conviction by a civil court for the purposes of sentencing. His reasons can be summarized as follows. First, the subordinate military court is not mentioned in s 3(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) nor in s 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) as a court of criminal jurisdiction `within Singapore`. Secondly, the subordinate military court as a creature of s 80 of the Singapore Armed Forces Act (Cap 295) (`SAFA`) has a unique status. Thirdly, by virtue of s 11(3) and (5) of the CPC the power to enhance sentence applies only to the civil courts exercising criminal jurisdiction.
As the first two reasons are interlinked I shall deal with them together. Article 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore states: 
 
The judicial power of Singapore shall be vested in a Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided by any written law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
The word `court` is defined in s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) as: 
 
... any court of competent jurisdiction in Singapore.
 
 
 
Both the subordinate military court and the civil subordinate courts would fall under this general umbrella, a point acknowledged by the learned district judge.
The subordinate military court is not a `subordinate court` as defined in s 2 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Further, it is not within the definition of subordinate courts within Singapore in s 3(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321), nor is it a court `for the administration of criminal justice within Singapore` under s 6 of the CPC. The subordinate military court is a creature of the SAFA. As such, there is a distinct dichotomy between the ordinary civil courts and the military courts: the SAFA relates only to persons subject to military law; it does not apply to civilians, and the High Court may only interfere in its operation by way of review and not appeal. Appeals from subordinate military courts lie to the Military Court of Appeal which constitutes a superior court of record from which there is no further appeal.
However, these observations do not inevitably lead to the conclusion drawn by the learned district judge that the clear distinction between the jurisdiction of the subordinate military courts and other subordinate courts must mean that a previous conviction by the subordinate military courts would be irrelevant to civil courts. In fact, the two spheres are not mutually exclusive. The statutes show two distinct and separate procedures that should be followed by each court once jurisdiction is assumed. However, the jurisdictions of the military and the civil courts are not entirely distinct and separate. The SAFA applies to all persons subject to military law, and by virtue of s 4 of the SAFA, the military court has exclusive jurisdiction where the offence is a military one. Additionally, however, under s 112 of the SAFA, the military court also possesses the jurisdiction to try a person subject to military law for any offence punishable by the law of Singapore. Thus where a person subject to military law commits an offence ordinarily tried by the civil courts, both the military and the civil courts would have concurrent jurisdiction as s 6 of the SAFA causes the jurisdiction of the civil court in such circumstance to remain unaffected. However, by virtue of s 108 of the SAFA, he may not be tried in both courts for the same offence. Thus, in certain circumstances, it would be a matter of chance whether an accused person is tried by a civil or a military court. As such, it would not be rational if the accused who is tried by the subordinate military courts is in a better position than another accused who is tried by the civil courts.
As for s 11(3) and (5) of the CPC, the proviso to s 11(3) states: 
 
Provided that where a District Court has convicted any person and it appears by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents, a punishment in excess of that prescribed in this subsection should be awarded, then the District Court may sentence that person to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and shall record its reason for so doing.
 
 
 
Section 11(5) is a similar provision for the magistrate`s court. The terms `convictions` and `antecedents` are not defined in the CPC.
It seems clear that these sections merely prescribe generally the maximum punishment that the two courts are empowered to impose and have nothing to do with prescribing minimum sentences for particular offences on the basis of recidivism. The fact that they do not extend to subordinate military courts does not affect this latter issue.
The learned district judge thought that owing to the fact that s 6 of the CPC mentions only the High Court, the district court and the magistrate`s court, the terms `convictions` and `antecedents` in s 11(3) and (5) must mean only those arising from the courts so mentioned. This reading of the subsections in question is not the most apparent one. It would seem rather that s 6 omits to mention the military courts because those courts are creatures of the SAFA and as such the procedures in the CPC apply only insofar as they are provided for by the SAFA. There is nothing on the face of s 11(3) and (5) that forbids the inclusion of a previous conviction before the military court within the terms `previous conviction` and `antecedents`. Even if one restricts `previous convictions` to those courts defined by s 6 of the CPC, the word `antecedents` should not be given such a narrow construction.
This interpretation is supported by s 372 of the CPC which provides methods for proving previous convictions. As pointed out earlier, the subordinate military court is a court of competent jurisdiction as defined by the Interpretation Act. Owing to the fact that the CPC does not define `court`, the subordinate military court must be within the meaning of the word `court` in s 372(1)(a) of the CPC. It follows that a previous conviction before a subordinate military court may be proved by the methods prescribed by s 372, and it would be perverse to assume that a method of proof was provided for no purpose.
I now turn to the second issue - whether the MDA allows such a conviction to be considered for a s 8(a) offence.
Section 8 creates two types of offences: s 8(a), the offence of `possession` in question, and s 8(b), offences of `consumption`.
At the crux of the dispute is s 33 of the MDA, which prescribes the punishment for each offence. Section 33(1) states: 
 
Except as provided in subsection (3), the second schedule shall have effect, in accordance with subsection (2), with respect to the way in which offences under this Act are punishable on conviction.
 
 
 
Section 33(3) states: 
 
If a person convicted of an offence under s 8(b) is again convicted of such an offence, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years; and in this subsection, `convicted of an offence` includes a conviction by a subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal constituted under the Singapore Armed Forces Act.
 
 
 
Thus while the punishment for a s 8(a) offence is governed by s 33(2) and the second schedule, punishment for a s 8(b) offence is governed by s 33(3) which specifically mentions previous convictions under the SAFA.
The learned district judge reached two conclusions from this discrepancy. The first was that the legislature accepted that s 33(3) is an `importing provision` that enables an otherwise irrelevant conviction before a military court to be relevant in a civil court for repeat offences under s 8(b) of the MDA. The second was that by restricting the importing provision to the s 8(b) offence, the legislature intended that a conviction before the subordinate military court should have no such effect in cases of repeated offences under s 8(a). This was by application of the maxim 
 expressio unius est exclusio alterius 
 : the premise that the mention of some matters warrants an inference that other cognate matters were intentionally excluded.
The discrepancy between s 33(3) and s 33(2) can however be explained by looking at the whole history of s 33(3). In the original MDA (Act 5 of 1973), there was no equivalent of the present s 33(3). Section 33(2) and the second schedule of the MDA provided only for enhanced punishment for repeated offences of drug possession under s 8(a). The equivalent of s 33(3) was inserted later by the amending Act 12 of 1977 to provide for enhanced punishment for repeated offences of drug consumption under s 8(b) committed by the accused while being subject to supervision. The proviso regarding convictions by the subordinate military court or the Military Court of Appeal was added at the time as a cautionary measure to make clear that the term `supervision` covered both supervision by civil authorities as well as military supervision. This section was later amended by Act 38 of 1989, by which the requirement of the accused being subject to supervision was deleted, but the reference to the subordinate military court and the Military Court of Appeal was not.
It is against this background that one should examine the applicability of the maxim 
 expressio unius est exclusio alterius 
 . This maxim is an aid to construction and operates only where it is not outweighed by other interpretative factors. As such, the court must be open to any other avenues that might better explain the exclusio. The correct approach was well illustrated by Wills J in 
 Colquhoun v 
 
 Brooks 
 1 at p 406: 
 
... the method of construction summarized in the maxim 
 expressio unius exclusio
 
 alterius
 is one that certainly requires to be watched. Perhaps few so-called rules of interpretation have been more frequently misapplied and stretched beyond their due limits. The failure to make the expressio complete very often arises from accident, very often from the fact that it never struck the draftsman that the thing supposed to be excluded needed specific mention of any kind; and the application of this and every other technical rule of construction varies so much under differing circumstances, and is open to so many qualifications and exceptions, that it is rarely that such rules help one to arrive at what is meant. ...
 
 
 
In my view the reference to the subordinate military court and the Military Court of Appeal in s 33(3) does not have the emphasis that the learned district judge placed upon it. Section 33(2) and (3) were not drafted at the same time. Further, when s 33(3) was drafted, the reference to the military courts served a purpose peculiar unto itself, a purpose now obsolete but nonetheless outliving its original expression despite express amendment. It would appear that the words were left by oversight rather than by design. The expressio unius principle is inapplicable here.
For these reasons, I allowed the appeal, set aside the previous order and sentenced the respondent to the minimum two years` imprisonment.

This is an appeal from the judgment of Chan Sek Keong J. By that judgment, the learned judge awarded to the respondents the sum of US$339,822 with interest and costs on their claim against the appellants for damages for breach of contract to carry and deliver from Bangkok, Thailand, to Khorramshahr, Iran, a cargo of 5,450 bales of kenaf (`the goods`) which were shipped on board the appellants` vessel Kota Sejarah and/or for conversion of the goods and/or for breach of duty as bailees and/or for negligence.
The material facts that gave rise to the dispute have been set out in great detail by the learned judge in his judgment which was reported in 
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 136
  . For our purpose, it is necessary only to recount them briefly as follows. On 3 January 1979, the respondents shipped on board the appellants` vessel Kota Sejarah in Bangkok the goods under two clean bills of lading for carriage to Khorramshahr. The vessel sailed from Bangkok on 6 January 1979 and arrived at Basrah on or about 26 January; Basrah is situate across the Shatt al-Arab waterway from Khorramshahr. The vessel could not get into Khorramshahr to discharge the goods because of congestion at the waterway arising from stevedores` and port workers` strikes on account of the then political unrest in Iran. After waiting in Basrah for sometime, the appellants decided to invoke cl 5 of the bills of lading (to which we shall revert in detail in a moment) and they telexed their agent in Bangkok to inform the shippers of their decision as follows: 
 
In view of the condition now prevailing in Iran and stevedore strike at Khorramshahr which prevent discharge of cargoes carried under the above-mentioned bill of lading destined for Khorramshahr, owners hereby give notice that they are obliged to invoke cl 5 of the said bills of lading and accordingly are proceeding to discharge the said cargo at Mina Qaboos or any other convenient ports. You and all interested parties are hereby invited to make arrangements concerning storage and on carriage of the said cargo so discharged. The cargo owners are advised to insure the cargo pending on carriage if necessary.
 
 
 
On being informed of this, the respondents telexed the appellants seeking information on the itinerary of the vessel and were informed by telex that most likely the goods would be discharged at Porbander on the west coast of India. Later, the vessel did go to Porbander and the goods were discharged there and stored at the port godown. Subsequently, there were telexes exchanged between the appellants and the respondents. On 1 March 1979, the appellants telexed to the respondents in which, among other things, they inquired whether the respondents or `the receivers` wished to make their own arrangements for forwarding the goods to Khorramshahr or to arrange with their agent in India for the purpose and suggested that the `receivers` should effect insurance on their goods and at the same time they also asked what the `receivers` intended to do in regard to the on-forwarding of the goods and insurance. There was no response to this telex. However, on 6 March, one SM Gourisaria, a director of the respondents, went to Bombay and met one PJ Dalal, the manager of James Mackintosh & Co Ltd (`Mackintosh`), the appellants` agent in India. They had discussions on various matters relating to the goods. After that, Gourisaria went to other parts of India and returned to Bombay by the end of March where he met and discussed with PJ Dalal further; he returned to London at the beginning of April. Nothing developed out of such discussions, and the goods continued to be stored at the port godown in Porbander.
On 9 May 1979, the respondents tried unsuccessfully to telex to the appellants on the current position relating to the goods. On the following day, the respondents telexed to Mackintosh requesting them to pass the following message to the appellants, which Mackintosh did: 
 
Pls note that we as holders of the bills of lading referred to above hold entitlement to and are owners of the goods resulting from a situation in which our buyers have defaulted stop We are in process of selling these goods elsewhere and as such ask you to instruct your agents in India, James Mackintosh Co Pte Ltd, Bombay not to remove cargo without our written approval and if and when we are able to sell these goods we will then give them the necessary instructions for the appropriate release in yr favour or at our discretion stop Needless to say we will be responsible for storage charges in Porbandar. Kindly confirm.
 
 
 
The appellants replied on 11 May stating that it was too late to comply with the request as the goods had already been loaded onto the vessel Kota Agung which was scheduled to depart for Mina Qaboos on 14 May and from Mina Qaboos for Khorramshahr on 17 May, and that they would be prepared to unload the cargo at Mina Qaboos subject to certain terms and conditions. On receipt of this telex, the respondents telexed Mackintosh stating that they did not want the cargo to be loaded, and in response Mackintosh replied by telex stating that the cargo had been loaded and that the ship was sailing on the following day which was 12 May, and that the cargo could not be discharged even at the expense of the respondents. To that the respondents protested by telex and they also sent a telex to the appellants stating, among other things, that they insisted that the latter telexed to Bombay to off-load the cargo and `leave as it was where it was`. Further exchange of telexes took place, and on 24 May 1979, the parties reached an agreement, without prejudice to each other`s rights, to have the goods reshipped to Bangkok at an agreed rate. Unfortunately, an untoward event happened to the Kota Agung: after her arrival at Khorramshahr on 17 June 1979, she caught fire on 9 July in the course of unloading her cargoes, resulting in a total constructive loss of her cargoes on board, including the respondents` goods.
Thereafter, the respondents instituted an in rem action, Admiralty in Rem No 870 of 1980 against Kota Bakti, a sister ship of Kota Agung, claiming damages for breach of contract, and/or conversion of the goods and/or for breach of duty as bailees and/or for negligence. Following that, another cargo owner also instituted an in rem action, Admiralty in Rem No 387 of 1981, but that action was against Kota Sejarah, also a sister ship of Kota Agung, claiming for similar reliefs. Both the actions were subsequently consolidated. However, only the respondents pursued their claims at the trial, as the parties to the second action had come to a settlement.
Before Chan Sek Keong J, the parties had agreed on certain matters. First, it was accepted that the respondents were the owners of the goods at the time of the reloading at Porbander; secondly, the appellants had properly invoked cl 5 of the bills of lading, and lastly, that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Cap 33) had no application to the transhipment of the goods. The following were the issues before the trial judge: 
 
 
(1) whether the appellants acted wrongfully in removing the goods from the port godown at Porbander and transhipping them on board the Kota Agung; 
 
(2) whether the removal and transhipment constitute conversion of the respondents` goods; and 
 
(3) alternatively, whether the appellants were in breach of duty as bailees and/or were negligent as a result of which the goods were lost by fire on board the Kota Agung.
  
 
 
The learned judge held that on the true construction of cl 5, the appellants having abandoned the voyage and discharged the goods at Porbander were not permitted under that clause to tranship the goods to Khorramshahr. On the second issue, he held that the respondents had a right to prohibit the transhipment of the goods and they exercised that right, and that as the appellants had no right to tranship the goods, the transhipment constituted conversion of the goods. The learned judge further held that the appellants had no right to retain possession of the goods on board the Kota Agung and the wrongful possession thereof constituted a trespass to the goods. The goods were lost whilst they were still in the possession of the appellants, and the appellants` position was that of an insurer and in the event that happened they were liable for the loss of the goods irrespective of whether or not they were negligent.
On the alternative claim for damages for breach of duty and/or negligence in the performance of the transhipment of the goods, the learned judge held that as the appellants were bailees of the goods, the onus was on them to establish that the goods were lost without their negligence and he found that the appellants had failed to discharge that onus. He was unable to find the cause of the fire but he found that the hatches remained open for three hours during the lunch break and that substantially increased the risks of fire occurring to the goods. In his view, since the fire was not caused by self-combustion or the heat of the sun either on the goods or the ship, it could only have been caused by an external source deliberately or accidentally. This source of fire was contemplated by the master. He found that the master of the ship was negligent or in breach of duty in failing to close the hatches during the lunch break and thereby increased the risks of fire occurring to the goods, and that in any event the appellants in failing to prove the probable cause of the fire had not discharged the onus of proving that their servants were not negligent. The learned judge then considered the defence relied upon by the appellants under s 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179) and held that the section had no application as the cargo was carried on board the ship without the consent of the owners of the goods.
Before us the issues raised are substantially the same as those that were raised below and may be restated as follows: 
 
 
(1) whether cl 5 of the bills of lading gave to the appellants the liberty to tranship the respondents` goods in the circumstances that occurred; 
 
(2) if the answer to the first issue is in the negative, whether the transhipment of the goods in the circumstances that occurred constituted a conversion of the goods; 
 
(3) alternatively, whether the appellants were in breach of duty as bailees of the goods and/or were negligent; and 
 
(4) whether the provisions of s 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179) applied to the goods of the respondents carried on board the Kota Agung.
  
 
 
The first issue turns essentially on the true construction of cl 5 of the bills of lading, which so far as relevant provides as follows: 
 
If the ... carriage discharge or delivery is impeded or if there are reasonable grounds for anticipating that the same is or threatens to be impeded by the imminence outbreak or existence of war ... or by ... lockouts strikes or disturbances ice bad weather or by absence from any cause of facilities for loading discharge or delivery or congestion or difficulties in loading or discharge, the carrier and/or his agents and/or the master may (if in his or their uncontrolled discretion he or they think it advisable) at any time before or after the commencement of the voyage abandon or suspend the voyage or alter or vary or depart from the proposed or advertised or agreed or customary route and/or delay or detain the vessel at or off any port or place and/or tranship and forward subject to the provisions of cl 11 hereof or put into bulk lighter or craft or land or store or otherwise dispose of the cargo at any port or ports place or places without being liable for any loss or damage whatsoever directly or indirectly sustained by the owners of the goods and all at the risk and expense of the owners of the goods. Anything done or not done by reason of or in compliance with the provisions hereinbefore contained or any of them shall be deemed to be within the contract voyage.
 
 
 
It is clear that cl 5 gave the appellants multiple liberties or options on the occurrence of any of the contingencies therein stipulated. It was accepted that the appellants, in the event that had occurred, were entitled to invoke cl 5 and that they had properly invoked cl 5. It was also accepted that in invoking cl 5 the appellants exercised the right of abandoning the voyage and they did abandon the voyage. They caused or directed the vessel to proceed to Porbander where the goods were discharged and stored at the port godown. The question that arises is whether having thus abandoned the voyage they were entitled, about two months later, to tranship the goods for on-carriage to Khorramshahr. Chan Sek Keong J held that the concept of abandonment of the voyage was inconsistent with that of transhipment and that as the appellants had abandoned the voyage and discharged the goods, they had fulfilled their part of the contract of carriage; they could not then tranship the goods. In other words, the contract had come to an end. Clause 5 could not be so construed as to give to the shipowners the two inconsistent alternatives. He said, at pp 142-143: 
 
... It is clear that cl 5 reserves to the defendants a number of options to take if the discharge of cargo is hindered by the occurrence of any of the prescribed events. The defendants may abandon the voyage, or suspend it or delay it. They may also discharge the cargo, presumably after an abandonment or a suspension of the voyage. They may also tranship the goods. However, the crucial question is whether the power to tranship the goods is cumulative with or alternative with the power to abandon the voyage. ... In my view, and having regard to the general law, cl 5 cannot be so construed. Such a construction will enable the defendants to decide on a conditional abandonment, a concept which will lead to great inconvenience to cargo owners. I am not aware of any authority giving effect to such a concept. If there is any doubt about the meaning of cl 5, it should be construed against the defendants. There is, I think, no inconsistency between the power to suspend or delay or alter the voyage and the power to tranship the cargo. This was not what the defendants purported to do. The voyage having come to an end at Porbander, there was nothing in cl 5 which gave the defendants the power to on-carry the goods to any other place.
 
 
 
Mr Isaac for the respondents supported this construction of cl 5. He submitted that under that clause the master may: 
 
 
(i) abandon the voyage, 
 or 
 
 
(ii) suspend the voyage, 
 or 
 
 
(iii) alter or vary or depart from the proposed or advertised or agreed or customary route, 
 and/or 
 
 
(iv) delay or detain the vessel at or off any port or place, 
 and/or 
 
 
(v) tranship and forward subject to the provisions of cl 11, 
 or 
 
 
(vi) put into bulk lighter or craft, 
 or 
 
 
(vii) land or store or otherwise dispose of the cargo at any port or ports, place or places.
  
 
 
In his submission, certain of the options available to the master are inconsistent with each other, and in particular the option (i) is mutually inconsistent with options (ii) and (iii); similarly option (i) is mutually inconsistent with option (iv), notwithstanding the conjunctions `and/or` preceding (iv). By the same reasoning, the option (i) is mutually inconsistent with option (v), also notwithstanding the conjunctions `and/or` preceding option (v). As a matter of language, the words `abandonment` and `transhipment` are not consistent with each other, and these words should be given their natural and ordinary meanings. At best, there is an ambiguity whether if the master has elected to abandon the voyage he still has the power to tranship the goods, and such ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the respondents. Accordingly, once the appellants had elected to abandon the voyage and had discharged the goods at Porbander, they had exhausted their rights under cl 5 and could not thereafter elect to tranship the goods for on-carriage to Khorramshahr. We find great merit in this submission and unhesitatingly accept it.
In the absence of any express liberty reserved or provided in a bill of lading the master has no general right to tranship goods carried on board his ship. The Australian case of 
 Barker v Burns Philp & Co Ltd 
 1 is instructive on this point. Under five bills of lading dated 8 December 1941, the plaintiffs shipped on board the defendants` vessel Mangola a cargo of wheat from Sydney to Singapore. The bills of lading contained conditions which, among other things, gave to the master various liberties. One of the liberties was that in the event of, inter alia, the imminence or existence of war, the master was empowered to depart from the agreed or customary route and/or discharge the cargo (for delivery or transhipment) at or off any port and when so discharged the carrier`s responsibility ceased and such discharge would constitute due delivery under the bills of lading. The ship sailed from Sydney on 13 December 1941 and joined a convoy sailing for Singapore. En route she called at Batavia (now Jakarta). Shortly after her arrival, Batavia was bombed twice and news of the fall of Singapore was received. Shore conditions at Batavia were chaotic and the master enquired from the naval authorities whether he could communicate with the owners and was informed that he could not as the army and navy had priority on all the lines. He made no further or other attempt to communicate with the owners. In particular, he did not try to communicate through the local wireless or cable office, although such communication was in fact possible. There was no prohibition against unloading the cargo in Batavia but no shore labour was available. The master was told to wait for the next convoy. He waited for a while and later took the ship back to Australia alone arriving first at Fremantle and subsequently the ship returned to Sydney with her cargoes. The defendants claimed half of the back freight to Sydney from the plaintiffs. The latter paid the freight under protest and instituted an action claiming the return of the back freight. The case was heard before Halse Rogers J who held that the defendants were entitled to full back freight to Fremantle and on that basis the defendants had not been overpaid, and he accordingly dismissed the claim. On appeal, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held by a majority that the defendants were not entitled to the back freight for the carriage of the goods back to Sydney. Jordan CJ in the course of his judgment said, at pp 17-18: 
 
I think that the proper inference from the evidence is that at Batavia the master ultimately decided to abandon the voyage. This he was entitled to do under the added condition No 2 on the front of the bill, a condition which authorizes him, when a state of war exists, either to abandon the voyage or to alter the route and proceed to the port of discharge by a different route. If he adopts the latter course he is performing the intended voyage in a varied but permitted manner. If the former, the voyage is abandoned, and the question arises as to what is to be done with the goods. No provision is made for this in the special added war provision. ... In my opinion, therefore, the position at Batavia was that the master was entitled, without reference to the owner of the goods, to land them there and also to abandon the voyage, if he thought this best in the interests of all parties, but that, he having abandoned the voyage, there was nothing in the bill of lading which entitled him to carry them to some other port without communicating to the owners of the goods (if it were reasonably possible to do so with a reasonable expectation of receiving a timely answer) such reasonably adequate information of the nature of the emergency and of the nature of, and reasons for, his proposed action, as it was reasonably possible for him to give, and obtaining their sanction. He was therefore not justified in taking the course which he did without instructions from them, unless (1) it was both necessary and reasonable so to carry the goods in what he might reasonably regard as the best interests of the shippers and (2) it was not reasonably possible for him to communicate with them, in circumstances giving a reasonable expectation that an answer would be received in time, or, if such communication was possible, and was had, no sufficient instructions were received in time to give him a reasonable opportunity of complying with them before it became necessary to act. In other words, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the bill of lading which takes the case out of the general law.
 
 
 
The learned Chief Justice examined the evidence as to whether it was possible for the master to communicate with the owners of the cargo with reasonable expectation of receiving a timely reply. There was ample evidence that the communications between Batavia and Sydney were in fact possible both by wireless and by cable. The learned Chief Justice therefore came to the conclusion that if the master had used due diligence, he could have taken advantage of the means of communication which were available and that the action of the master in carrying the goods back to Fremantle without instructions from the plaintiffs was unauthorized. Davidson J who dissented from the conclusion reached by the majority also held (at p 21) that the master had no express authority to bring back the goods at the expense of the shipper but held that the conditions then prevailing in Batavia justified the master bringing the cargoes back and accordingly the defendants were entitled to the full back freight to Fremantle. Street J agreed with Jordan CJ that the defendants were not entitled to the back freight but on different grounds. He held that on the true construction of the provisions of the bills of lading the master, although he had abandoned the voyage in Batavia, was entitled to bring the goods back to Sydney but the plaintiffs were not liable for the back freight. He said, at p 25: 
 
... If he had commenced the voyage, the master could decide at any moment, assuming such decision was bona fide, to abandon all intention of proceeding further and was to be entitled then, inter alia, to return to the port of shipment, land the goods and place them in store at the disposal of the owner subject to the payment by such owner of all landing and storage charges.
 
 
 
The right to return the goods to the port of shipment was available to the master in the present case under the express terms of the bill of lading. It is true that he had decided at Batavia to abandon the voyage originally contemplated by the terms of the bill of lading. ... But abandonment of the voyage does not mean the abandonment or destruction of the contract. The voyage had been broken off with the intention on the part of the master of relinquishing, finally and permanently, its further continuance to the originally designated port of destination. The possibility of such a situation arising had, it seems to me, been clearly foreseen by the parties and their contract makes provision to meet such an occasion. The master was then to have the right to land and store the goods at any intermediate port or might, if he so chose, return them to the port of shipment.
In our judgment, on the true construction of cl 5 of the bills of lading the appellants having abandoned the voyage were not authorized under cl 5 to tranship the goods at Porbander for on-carriage to Khorramshahr. Even if we are wrong on this construction and under cl 5 the appellants had such liberty of transhipment, they had elected not to exercise the right of transhipment at all. We find that on the evidence it is clear that in February 1979 when the appellants invoked cl 5 and abandoned the voyage they had no intention of effecting a transhipment of the goods, then or later. In fact, their telexes evinced their intention to the contrary. First, in their telex of 3 February they stated that they had been obliged to invoke cl 5; that they were proceeding to discharge the cargoes at Mina Qaboos or any other convenient ports; that the cargo owners were invited to make arrangements concerning storage and on-carriage of the cargo to be discharged, and that the cargo owners were advised to insure the cargo pending on-carriage, if necessary. Next, in their telex of 8 February, the appellants reaffirmed their telex of 3 February and stated that the respondents were to take delivery of the cargo when discharged and that they would inform the respondents when and where the cargo was to be discharged so as to enable them to take delivery. The appellants chose Porbander as the port of discharge. The ship proceeded to Porbander and discharged the cargoes there and stored them at the port godowns. Following that, in their telex dated 13 February to their agents in Khorramshahr, the appellants again stated that it was up to the cargo owners or consignees to make arrangements for their cargoes to be on-carried to their destination on their own account; that the cargo owners were to be responsible for freight, storage, expenses and handling charges; that if they so desired, they should ask the appellants` agents to act on their behalf, and that they must arrange for necessary insurance whilst in storage and in transit from the loading port to the destination. It is abundantly clear that the appellants had selected Porbander as the final port of discharge and upon discharge of the goods there, had treated the contract of carriage as terminated. They had no intention of effecting a transhipment of the goods for on-carriage to Khorramshahr. In our judgment, the appellants in the circumstances had no right to tranship the goods onto the Kota Agung for on-carriage to Khorramshahr.
The goods were stored in the godown for over two months, and the appellants did not communicate with the respondents before they decided to load the goods onto the Kota Agung. It was possible for the appellants to communicate with the respondents and seek their instructions, and indeed there was ample opportunity for the appellants to verify the respondents` wishes in the two months before the arrival of the Kota Agung at Porbander in May 1979. The appellants never sought the respondents` instructions in advance of the goods being loaded on board the Kota Agung and informed the respondents only after the event that the goods had been loaded. The appellants` decision to load the respondents` goods onto the Kota Agung was an unilateral act carried out without the consent of the respondents. It is true that the appellants did telex the respondents on 1 March 1979 asking them if they wished to make their own arrangements for onward forwarding the goods to Khorramshahr or if they wished the appellants` agents to arrange this on their behalf. It is also true that the respondents never responded to this telex. But this silence on the part of the respondents did not amount to an indication of their consent to the transhipment decided by the appellants two months later. It was at all times `reasonably possible` during this period for the appellants to communicate with the respondents `with reasonable expectation of an answer`. They failed to do so.
It was submitted by Mr Thomas for the appellants that, assuming that the contract of carriage was terminated, the appellants by remaining in possession of the goods became involuntary bailees of the goods and their duty was to take such measures to preserve the goods as a man of ordinary prudence would take for the preservation of his own property: 
 China-Pacific SA v Food Corporation of India 
 .2 We accept this proposition. But we do not accept that the appellants in this case were entitled, in fulfilment of their duty as bailees, to load the goods onto the Kota Agung for on-carriage to Khorramshahr without first obtaining the consent or permission from the respondents, though the respondents were apprised of the facts and did not give any instruction for over two months. The case of 
 China- Pacific SA 
 2 does not support the contention made on behalf of the appellants that they were entitled to do so. In that case, the salvors salved a quantity of wheat from a vessel stranded on a reef in the South China Sea and brought the wheat to Manila where it was stored at the salvors` expenses. The salvors informed the cargo owners of the salvage work and asked them to make arrangement to take delivery of the cargo, but there was no response from the cargo owners. Subsequently, the shipowner abandoned the voyage and notified the cargo owners accordingly. The cargo owners refused to pay for storage charges for the period prior to the abandonment of the voyage on the ground that the contract of affreightment was still afoot and the immediate right to possession vested in the shipowners and it was the shipowners who would be liable to the salvors for the expenses incurred during the period. The House of Lords held that the salvage agreement was signed by the master of the ship as agent for the cargo owners and that when the goods were salved and taken into possession by the salvors, the direct relationship of bailor and bailee was created between the cargo owners and the salvors and all the mutual rights and duties attaching to that relationship at common law applied. So long as that relationship continued, the salvors as the bailee owed a duty of care to the cargo owners to take such measures to preserve the salved wheat from deterioration as a man of prudence would take for the preservation of his own property. Arising from this relationship, there was a correlative right of the salvors to reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in taking measures to preserve the property: see the speech of Lord Diplock at pp 960-961. Accordingly, the salvors were held entitled to reimbursement of the expenses reasonably incurred by them in fulfilment of the duty owed to the cargo owners. But the case is not an authority for the proposition contended on behalf of the appellants that a bailee in fulfilling his duty to the bailor may remove the goods, as in this case, without the necessity of communicating with and seeking the direction of the bailor where the bailor has been fully apprised of the facts.
Mr Thomas also submitted that the duty of the appellants as bailees of the goods includes a power to remove the goods to a `better place` and he relied on 
 Cargo ex Argos 
 ,3 
 Great Northern Railway Co v Swaffield 
 4 and 
 Pedrick v Morning Star Motors 
 .5 The cases relied upon do not really support his argument. 
 Cargo ex Argos 
 3 was an appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court of Admiralty. There, petroleum was shipped on board the Argos from London for Havre and on the ship`s arrival at Havre, the authorities required the master to take her away because of the petroleum on board. The ship then sailed to the neighbouring ports but was not allowed to stay. The ship then returned to Havre, but no bill of lading was presented and no application was made for taking delivery of the petroleum. The ship subsequently returned to London bringing the petroleum back. It was held that the shipowner was entitled to the freight, back freight and expenses. Sir Montague E Smith delivering the judgment said, at p 165: 
 
... It is well established that, if the ship has waited a reasonable time to deliver goods from her side, the master may land and warehouse them at the charge of the merchant; and it cannot be doubted that it would be his duty to do so rather than to throw them overboard. In a case like the present, where the goods could neither be landed nor remain where they were, it seems to be a legitimate extension of the implied agency of the master to hold that, in the absence of all advices, he had authority to carry or send them on to such other place as in his judgment, prudently exercised, appeared to be most convenient for their owner; and if so, it will follow from established principles that the expenses properly incurred may be charged to him.
 
 
 
In the 
 Great Northern Railway Co 
 case,4 the facts were entirely different. There, the defendant sent a horse through the plaintiff railway and failed to take delivery at the destination and the plaintiff placed the horse in a livery stable. It was held that the plaintiff acted reasonably and was entitled to be reimbursed all the livery charges which had been paid. In 
 Pedrick v Morning Star Motors 
 ,5 the plaintiff bought a car from the defendant and subsequently sent it to the latter for repairs. After the repairs, the plaintiff refused to take the car complaining that the repairs were unsatisfactory. The defendant, after notice to the plaintiff, placed the car at the public car park where it was subsequently stolen. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the defendant was not under any obligation to keep the car which belonged to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was in breach of contract in failing to collect it when he was given the opportunity and was urged to collect it, and accordingly the risk of the car was and remained with him. In the course of his judgment, Megaw LJ said: 
 
... It is not a part of a contract, when somebody hands over a chattel to somebody else in order to do work on it, that the person to whom it has been handed over shall be obliged, by virtue of his contract, to keep that chattel - whether it be a white elephant, a motor car, or anything else - indefinitely, for the convenience of the owner and to his own inconvenience and disadvantage.
 
 
 
The factual situation in the instant case is entirely different from those in the three cases. The goods were discharged at Porbander and stored at the port godown. The contract of carriage was terminated. The appellants as bailees were well entitled to be reimbursed by the respondents as bailors for all the storage charges and other expenses incurred. The goods remained in the godown for well over two months, and during this period neither party communicated with each other. There was no evidence or suggestion that the godown at Porbander was not a safe or suitable place for storing the goods; so no question of removing the goods to a safer or more suitable place or `a better place` arose. The appellants were not removing the goods and placing them in `a better place`; they were loading them on board the Kota Agung for transhipment to Khorramshahr in purported performance of the contract which had been terminated.
The appellants did not have contractually the right of transhipment. The loading of the goods on board the Kota Agung was carried out without the respondents` permission or consent and that was for the purpose of on-carriage to Khorramshahr. That they were not entitled to do. In so doing, the appellants went beyond the fulfilment of their duty as bailees and dealt with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the respondents` right. In our opinion, in loading the goods on board the Kota Agung without the permission or consent of the respondents, the appellants committed conversion of the goods. Even if that was not conversion, the appellants clearly committed conversion subsequently in refusing to unload the goods from Kota Agung upon request by the respondents. As the learned judge said, by transhipping the goods against or contrary to the instructions of the respondents, the appellants asserted a right which was inconsistent with the respondents` right. The learned judge further found, and this was not challenged, that the appellants in transhipping the goods intended to charge freight and to claim a lien on the goods for freight and that in so doing, the appellants intended to assert dominion over the goods. In our judgment, the transhipment of the goods by the appellants constituted conversion.
The learned judge also found that the appellants had committed trespass to the goods. In our opinion, the evidence adduced was more than sufficient to support such a finding. Trespass to goods is a wrongful physical interference with them. Removing someone`s goods against his wishes is a trespass. Thus, in removing the respondents` goods from the godown at Porbander and loading them onto the Kota Agung and thereafter retaining them on board against the demand by the respondents, the appellants committed trespass to the goods.
The appellants committed conversion of and trespass to the goods, and the goods were lost whilst they were in their unlawful possession. The appellants were in the position of insurers of the goods and in the events that happened were liable for the loss, whether or not they were negligent: 
 Shaw & Co v Symmons & 
 
 Sons 
 .6 In that case, the plaintiffs entrusted books to the defendants, a bookbinder, to be bound and to be redelivered when bound to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs subsequently requested the defendants to redeliver the books which had been bound but the defendants failed to do so within a reasonable time. The books were subsequently destroyed by fire in the defendants` premises, and the defendants were held liable for the loss. Avory J having referred to 
 Davis v 
 
 Garrett 
 7 at p 724 and other cases, said at p 801: 
 
... To quote the words of Tindal CJ in 
 Davis v Garrett
 (1830) 6 Bing 716 at p 724, `as a loss has actually happened whilst his wrongful act was in operation and force`, they cannot set up as an answer to the action the bare possibility of a loss if their wrongful act had never been done.
 
 
 
This decision was followed in 
 Mitchell v Ealing London Borough Council 
 8 where a gratuitous bailee was held liable for the loss of the goods as insurer after it had failed to return the goods to the bailor as previously arranged. O`Connor J said, at p 9: 
 
Applying the law laid down in 
 Shaw & Co v Symmons & Sons
 
[1917] 1 KB 799
 to the facts of the present case (sympathetic as I am with the defendants) it seems to me that the failure of the defendants to send their representative to the agreed place for the delivery of the goods was a negligent failure on their part, and from that moment they became insurers of the goods. As I have said in the earlier part of this judgment the plaintiff`s claim has no merits to support it, but the law, in my judgment, is clear. It was a mistake on the part of the defendants, and, as I have said, I have great sympathy with them that they were unable to rectify it. But the arrangement made on 17 December fits precisely into the pattern of the law as I recognize it to be well established, and the failure of the defendants to keep the appointment was a failure which makes them responsible thereafter for the loss of the goods.
 
 
 
We now turn to the alternative claim by the respondents against the appellants as bailees of the goods for breach of duty and/or negligence. It was not in dispute that the goods were damaged by fire and the goods at the material time were in the possession and control of the appellants, and the burden is on them to prove that the fire was not occasioned by their negligence. The learned judge found that they had not proved the probable cause of the fire and had not discharged the burden. However, he found that the opening of the hatches during the lunch break of three hours substantially increased the risks of fire occurring to the goods and that the master was negligent or in breach of duty in not closing the hatches during the lunch break. On the evidence, he was justified in making these findings. In particular, the master testified in evidence that he was aware of the highly sensitive and combustible nature of the cargo; that he was aware of the fire hazards; that he was aware of the volatile state of affairs in Khorramshahr, but that he had decided on the `ventilation` of the holds as important and was content to leave the hatches open for such a long period of time despite the risk of damage this would pose to the cargo.
We now turn to the last issue, and that is whether s 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179) applies to relieve the appellants from liability for the loss of the goods. The section provides: 
 
The owner of a British ship ... shall not be liable to make good to any extent whatever any loss or damage happening without his actual fault or privity in the following cases:
 
 
 
 
(a) where any goods, merchandise or other thing whatsoever taken in or put on board his ship are lost or damaged by reason of fire on board the ship; ...
  
 
 
(Under s 3 of the Merchant Shipping Act `British ship` is construed as `Singapore ship`.)
 
 
 
The learned judge held that this section had no application in this case where goods were carried on board the ship without the consent of the owner of the goods. It was submitted by Mr Thomas on behalf of the appellants that since the learned judge had found that the loss of the goods by fire on board the Kota Agung happened without actual fault or privity of the appellants, they were exempted from liability by reason of the statutory provision and he challenged the conclusion of the learned judge that the provision was not applicable. He contended that the provision was based on public policy and the expedient protection of shipowners. We find it unnecessary to consider whether the learned judge`s conclusion is correct. Even if what was contended by Mr Thomas is correct, the statutory provision is of no assistance to the appellants. The torts of conversion of and trespass to the goods had been committed by the appellants before the fire took place, and the appellants` liability to the respondents had already arisen, and, as the learned judge held, they were in the position of insurers and were liable for any loss howsoever incurred.
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs. In our opinion, this appeal merits the issue of a certificate of two solicitors pursuant to O 59 r 19. We accordingly so order. There will be the usual consequential order that the deposit paid into court as security be paid to the respondents or their solicitors.

This is a petition for criminal revision in which the petitioner seeks to have set aside her conviction of 22 May 1992 on the following charge, on the basis that her plea of guilt to this charge ought not to have been accepted by the district court: 
 
You, Yenna Ong Ah Yeo, are charged that you between 20 and 22 June 1990, in Singapore, abetted one Lim Teck Cheng, a director of Wyno Marine Pte Ltd (`Wyno`) who in such capacity being entrusted with dominion over property, namely, moneys belonging to Wyno, to commit criminal breach of trust as an agent, in that you intentionally aided the said Lim Teck Cheng to dishonestly misappropriate the sum of $282,000 when you arranged for Wyno to pay to one Lee & Kong Engineering Works the said sum pursuant to two invoices Nos 1267/90 and 1268/90 both dated 20 June 1990 and have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
On her plea of guilt and subsequent conviction, she was sentenced to six months` imprisonment. The main grounds she relies upon in asking for revision of those proceedings are as follows. First, the principal accused, Lim Teck Cheng, has claimed trial to the charge against him of committing the offence of criminal breach of trust which the petitioner has been convicted of abetting. Secondly, she has been advised that the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution in support of the charge set out above did not in fact support that charge.
Counsel`s first main submission was that where a principal accused has not been found guilty of an offence, no person may be convicted of intentionally aiding such an offence. Section 108 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) provides that: 
 
A person abets an offence who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.
 
 
 
Explanation 2 of this section is as follows: 
 
To constitute the offence of abetment, it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.
 
 
 
Explanation 2 may not immediately appear to be within the plain meaning of s 108, but illustration (a) of this explanation is: 
 
A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.
 
 
 
The express words of explanation 2 and illustration (a) are sufficient to show that, for an abettor to be convicted, the principal accused need not always be proved to have committed the offence (or the actus reus of the offence) for which he is charged.
Counsel contended that nevertheless, where the alleged abetment takes the specific form of intentional aid, rather than instigation or conspiracy, the principal must be found guilty of the offence aided before the abettor may be convicted, because `a person cannot aid another in doing something which that other has not done` (per Avory J in 
 Morris v Tolman 
 1).
In 
 Faguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam 
 ,2 the court said at p 674: 
 
In the case of abetment by aid a person can be said to abet by aiding only when by the commission of an act he intends to facilitate the commission of the offence and does facilitate the commission thereof. Therefore where a person is charged with abetment by aid of an offence under s 161 and the person charged with the offence is acquitted on the ground that he had not committed the offence no question of intentionally aiding by any act or omission the commission of that offence arises. Therefore whether the acquittal is right or wrong the conviction of the abettor also cannot be allowed to stand in the circumstances.
 
 
 
In 
 Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar 
 ,3 the court said: 
 
It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that the act abetted must be committed. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.
 
 
 
I have considered these and other authorities cited to me and I am persuaded that they are consistent with counsel`s proposition. In the normal case the charge against an abettor should state the act he is alleged to have abetted. This is as true of charges of abetment by intentional aid as it is of charges of abetment by instigation or conspiracy. This act therefore forms part of the prosecution`s case against the alleged abettor. There is in the meaning of `instigation` and `conspiracy` no inherent assumption that either the instigation or the conspiracy came to fruition, and so while the act instigated or conspired towards by the abettor can and must be identified, the fact that its actual commission might not be proved is unobjectionable. Conversely, the word `aid` does imply that the act aided was committed, so it follows that the prosecution must prove the commission of the act which an abettor is alleged to have aided intentionally.
Indeed the prosecution must prove more than this. Intentionally aiding the commission of an act is not the same as intentionally aiding the commission of an offence. Explanation 2 of s 107 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.
 
 
 
This, read with s 108, indicates that a person may abet an offence who aids in the commission of an act which might only be a constituent part of the whole actus reus of the offence. If he may only be said to have aided where the aid has given results, then it follows that he may only be said to have intentionally aided that offence if the whole actus reus of the offence itself is proved to have been committed. If it has not and only the act which forms a part of the actus reus of the offence has been proved to have been committed, his intentional aiding of that act may only support his liability for intentionally aiding an attempted commission of the offence (assuming the evidence amounts to such attempt).
However, I would depart from many of the Indian cases in the following respect. The fact that the act intentionally aided must have been committed does not mean that the principal should of necessity have been convicted prior to the alleged abettor in order that the latter may be found liable for aiding him. The sequence in which the principal and the intentional aider are tried is frequently a matter of chance; and indeed, on occasion it may not be possible to try the principal at any time at all, for example, where he dies before trial or where he cannot be found. It is quite unacceptable that in these cases the intentional aider should also be immune from liability.
Moreover the conviction of the abettor turns on the evidence against him, which may be different from that admitted against the principal. I turn gratefully to the judgment of West J in 
 R v Maruti Dada 
 4 for the full expression of this conception: 
 
The offence of abetment under the Penal Code is a substantive offence ... By the Indian as well as the English procedure, an abettor may be convicted before the principal is arrested. The principal may then be tried and acquitted, but in this case the abettor has not suffered any wrong. A rational doubt may exist as to the identity or guilt of the principal through the legal exclusion as to him of particular portions of the evidence, and yet there may be no possible doubt as to the guilt of the abettor, in whose case the rules of exclusion do not happen to operate. It would be a perversion of the rules of evidence if because the operation of a rule is to exclude evidence against a principal, A, it should operate to the acquittal of an abettor, B, who may have fully confessed ... and may, without doubt, be guilty. The mere circumstance that B is tried along with A, instead of at a different trial, cannot alter the real force of the case against him.
 
 
 
Again, in 
 R v Humphreys and Turner 
 5 there is an instructive passage in the judgment of Chapman J: 
 
It may seem anomalous ... that even if a principal offender is acquitted, a conviction of aiding and abetting him may still be valid, but the logic of the situation is wrapped up in the rules of evidence. In a case where two people are charged a jury is always directed to consider each case separately. This is because the evidence as against one accused or another may be quite different in validity (ie admissibility) or strength. ... It would be anomalous if a person who admitted to a substantial part in the perpetration of a misdemeanour as aider and abettor could not be convicted on his own admission merely because the person alleged to have been aided and abetted was not or could not be convicted.
 
 
 
In my view, the court which tries an abettor on a charge of intentionally aiding an offence must direct its mind towards making a finding as to whether or not the whole actus reus of the offence he is alleged to have aided was in fact committed; and the court may, indeed must, do so in all cases, including those where the principal has not been convicted of that offence by the time the alleged intentional aider is tried.
In short, although illustration (a) of explanation 2 of s 108 indicates that an abettor`s liability may extend beyond situations in which the principal is entitled to be acquitted on the basis of a defence personal to himself to situations where the actus reus of the offence has not been committed, this extension cannot apply where the abetment takes the form of intentional aid rather than instigation or conspiracy.
No doubt the danger of inconsistent verdicts becomes live as a result of this interpretation since, for example, the court which tries the principal may acquit him whereas the intentional aider might have been convicted earlier, implying possibly incompatible findings made by two courts as to the principal`s liability. In the first place, the potential discrepancy between such findings does not mean this procedure is logically flawed, as explained in the passages quoted from 
 R v Maruti Dada 
 4 and 
 R v Humphreys and Turner 
 .5 Further, many other factors and interests are operative. In my view, it would be unworkable and prejudicial to the public interest to insist unwaveringly upon the ideal that the principal and the intentional aider should always be tried in some particular order even though, where they are not tried in that order, the spectre of inconsistent verdicts will be unavoidable.
Applying these principles to the present case, the court before which the petitioner pleaded guilty had to have been satisfied on the material before it, namely, the prosecution`s statement of facts tendered in support of the charge against the petitioner, that Lim Teck Cheng had committed the actus reus of the offence the petitioner was alleged to have abetted. The fact that Lim Teck Cheng had chosen to claim trial should not have affected that finding. Therefore all that was required of the prosecution was that the statement of facts should disclose, inter alia, the actus reus of the offence she was alleged to have abetted. Counsel`s second main submission questioned whether the statement of facts tendered in this case did in fact support the charge against the petitioner. I therefore turn to examine this issue, for which I will set out the relevant facts.
The prosecution had to show first that Lim Teck Cheng, being entrusted as a director of Wyno with dominion over moneys belonging to it, had misappropriated the sum of $282,000 and thereby committed the actus reus of the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent of that company. The prosecution also had to show that the petitioner aided Lim Teck Cheng in performing the misappropriation by arranging for that company to pay to one Lee & Kong Engineering Works the said sum pursuant to the two invoices described in the charge. Further, the prosecution had to show that the petitioner did so intentionally - that is, with the intention that Lim Teck Cheng should misappropriate the moneys. The statement of facts tendered by the prosecution disclosed the following facts.
From 26 June 1989 the petitioner worked as an accountant in a company called Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd (`Hong Lam`). On 13 September 1989 she was appointed a director of that company, her fellow director being Lim Teck Cheng. On 13 February 1990 the petitioner was also appointed a director of Wyno, a recently formed company whose other directors were Lim Teck Cheng and one Koh Chye Heng.
In June 1990 Lim Teck Cheng told the petitioner and Koh Chye Heng that he had approached International Factors Marine (S) Pte Ltd (`IFM`) for a loan of $4.2m for the construction of a vessel, and that as a condition of the loan, Hong Lam had to show IFM that expenses of $500,000 had already been incurred by it in the construction of the vessel. Lim Teck Cheng said that Hong Lam could not fulfil this condition and after some discussion, it was agreed that Wyno should ask its subcontractors to issue false invoices, on which Wyno should pay them, after which they would simply return the money to Lim Teck Cheng.
In pursuance of this scheme, Lim Teck Cheng later specifically instructed the petitioner to obtain false invoices from Lee & Kong Engineering Works. On or around 20 June 1990 the petitioner signed two purchase orders, Nos WM102-3001 and WM102-3002, on behalf of Koh Chye Heng, from Wyno to Lee & Kong Engineering Works. Lee & Kong Engineering Works then issued their invoices, Nos 1267/90 for $240,000 and 1268/90 for $42,000 in respect of these purchase orders. On or around 22 June 1990 the petitioner raised a payment voucher No 067/06/90 for $282,000 in respect of the two invoices. Lim Teck Cheng, who controlled the moneys belonging to Wyno, issued a cheque for that sum. This was given to Lee & Kong Engineering Works, who promptly issued a cheque returning the sum to the petitioner, who in turn handed it back to Lim Teck Cheng. This cheque was encashed by Lim Teck Cheng and the moneys deposited in Hong Lam`s bank account.
On or around 27 June 1990 Lim Teck Cheng handed the petitioner a deposit slip dated that day for an amount of $298,500, informing her that this sum comprised the $282,000 returned by Lee & Kong Engineering Works and a $16,500 loan from `Winoso Trading`. He instructed the petitioner to record the total amount in the accounts of Hong Lam as a loan from himself and she did so. Before the petitioner left Hong Lam in 1991, she told Lim Teck Cheng that he should reverse the $282,000 that was recorded in Wyno`s accounts as construction costs of the vessel and in Hong Lam`s accounts as a loan. Up to the date the petitioner pleaded guilty, this had not been done.
This is the sum of the relevant facts in the prosecution`s statement of facts. The loss in the transaction was suffered by Wyno: $282,000 which originally belonged to Wyno became totally disengaged from that company, being transformed instead into a debt owed to Lim Teck Cheng by Hong Lam. The charge against the petitioner alleges that her abetment of Lim Teck Cheng`s criminal breach of trust took the form of arranging for Wyno to pay the $282,000 to Lee & Kong Engineering Works pursuant to the invoices. Yet it is not stated anywhere in the statement of facts that at the time the petitioner arranged for the said payment she knew that she would be asked to record the money returned from Lee & Kong Engineering Works as a loan to Hong Lam rather than as an asset belonging to Wyno. If anything, the statement of facts indicated that the petitioner would have thought that the money would be returned to Wyno, which would then have been no worse off than before the payment out was made. Her intention at the time she did the acts for which she was charged, namely, arranging for Wyno to pay the money to Lee & Kong Engineering Works pursuant to the two invoices dated 20 June 1990, was simply not addressed at all in the statement of facts.
This being the case, even if it is assumed in favour of the prosecution that the statement of facts did disclose the commission of the act/s constituting the offence of criminal breach of trust as an agent alleged against Lim Teck Cheng, the petitioner has still not been proven to have intentionally aided the commission of such act/s. She has not been shown to have arranged for the payment to Lee & Kong Engineering Works with the intention that Lim Teck Cheng should misappropriate the moneys.
This alone is sufficient for my decision. The statement of facts hinted at an overall scheme devised to extract money wrongfully from IFM; alternately, the petitioner`s obedience to Lim Teck Cheng`s instructions to record the deposit in Hong Lam`s bank account as a loan might have been questionable. However, the statement of facts, as it stood, did not permit of more than mere conjecture as to these possibilities, nor did it disclose enough for a substitute charge to be sensibly drafted. This court cannot and will not, in the face of the limited material before it, take upon itself the duty of the prosecution either in deciding what charge might have been appropriate, or in plugging by surmise the deficiencies in the facts laid before it. For the same reasons, s 111 of the Penal Code, on the facts before the court, will not assist the prosecution in the absence of any factual or legal material on which this court may conclude that the alleged criminal breach of trust was a probable consequence of the aid rendered by the petitioner. From the facts which were disclosed, the activities described seem undeniably highly suspect. However, to say any more would be an unjustified exercise in speculation which cannot make up for an improperly drafted charge or statement of facts.
I would make one other observation. The charge itself was strictly improper. The relevant portions of s 405 of the Penal Code are as follows: 
 
Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with ... any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates ... that property ... commits `criminal breach of trust`. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The charge in the present case alleged only that the petitioner `intentionally aided the said Lim Teck Cheng to dishonestly misappropriate the sum of $282,000`. There was no mention of the $282,000 being the property which Lim Teck Cheng was entrusted with dominion over, though this was in fact the case and there was ample and undisputed evidence as to this. That is, though Lim Teck Cheng was described in the charge as a director of Wyno who in such capacity was entrusted with dominion over property, namely, moneys belonging to Wyno, it was not also alleged in the charge that the salient $282,000 misappropriated were moneys belonging to Wyno. On the facts, this was a minor point and were it the sole objection to the proceedings against the petitioner would no doubt have merited little concern. As it is, the cumulative deficiencies in the prosecution case are not to be lightly regarded.
In all the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the proper course for me in the interests of justice would be to grant the petition and set aside the petitioner`s conviction. I do so accordingly. The costs of prosecution paid by the petitioner must be refunded to her.

The two accused were jointly charged with committing a murder on 25 March 1988 at about 2.30am on Bukit Timah Avenue. The body of the deceased was found lying on the road at 4am by police patrolmen. He had been stabbed to death with a single-edged knife just after he had emerged from a nearby gambling den.
In the early evening of 28 March 1988 the first accused was detained, arrested for the murder and then taken to the CID. There, he gave a statement at 10.30pm after being administered a warning as prescribed in s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The next day he led the investigating officer to a carpark in Toa Payoh where the deceased`s wallet was recovered from a covered drain. He made further statements in Malay on 5 April and 8 April 1988. Before each statement the interpreter informed him only that he was bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which he was acquainted concerning the case.
At the trial, the first accused disputed the admissibility of all these statements. In particular, he contended that the statements he gave on 5 April and 8 April 1988 were inadmissible on the ground that they were not made voluntarily. He said that if he had known that he was entitled to avoid saying anything which might expose him to a criminal charge he would not have said anything.
On 31 March 1988 the second accused was brought to the CID and gave a statement there at 7.15pm. At 10.05pm he was arrested for the same murder. At 11.15pm he gave another statement. On 11 April and 19 April 1988 he made further statements. All his statements were, by consent, admitted in evidence at the trial.
The trial judges admitted the first accused`s s 122(6) statement after finding that it was made voluntarily. They decided however that the remaining statements were unsafe and should not be admitted. Their reasons for so deciding form the basis for this reference.
Essentially, the trial judges held that art 9(1) of the Constitution, which provides that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save according to the law, also encompasses the right of silence, and s 121 of the CPC must be construed so as to give effect to this right. Further, the person questioned under this section must have a corresponding right to be told that he has a right of silence. Accordingly when a s 121 statement is sought to be admitted under s 122 (5), it must satisfy not only the conditions described in s 122 (5) but also the conditions read into s 121. The trial judges declined to follow 
 PP v Tan Ho Teck 
 1 and 
PP v Chandran a/l Gangatharan & Ors
 
[1989] 3 CLASNEWS 11
 and held that a warning had to be administered whenever a statement was taken pursuant to s 121 of the CPC. Since the accused in this case was not told of his right of silence, they held that the s 121 statements were inadmissible. Moreover, he had been told that he was bound to talk, and had been in police custody for some time, before those further statements were taken; this was an alternate basis fortifying the conclusion that the statements were inadmissible.
The Attorney General, pursuant to s 265(3) of the CPC, certified three points of law for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal. These were: 
 
 
(1) Whether a suspect or an accused must be expressly informed of a right to remain silent whenever any statement is recorded from him pursuant to s 121 (2) of the CPC. 
 
(2) Whether a failure to so inform him is a breach of his constitutional rights under art 9(1) of the Constitution. 
 
(3) Whether any statement recorded from a suspect or an accused under s 121(1) and sought to be admitted in evidence under the provisions of s 122(5) of the CPC cannot be so admitted if no caution has been read to him in terms of s 121(2) of the Code.
  
 
 
We answered all three questions in the negative and now give our reasons for doing so. It is helpful to set out here the terms of s 121. 
 
 
(1) A police officer making a police investigation under this Chapter may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and shall reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined. 
 
(2) Such person shall be bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted concerning the case except only that he may decline to make with regard to any fact or circumstance a statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. 
 
(3) A statement made by any person under this section shall be read over to him and shall, after correction if necessary, be signed by him.
  
 
 
Section 121 contains one of several special powers of investigation given under Chapter XIII of the CPC. Under s 121(1), power is given to police officers making police investigations to examine a person and to compel him to answer questions. Conditions are prescribed in ss 121(1) and (3) for the use of this power so as to ensure the reliability of the statements recorded: a statement must be reduced into writing, read over to the witness and he must then sign it. Furthermore, the exception contained in s 121(2) applies as a limitation upon that power of compulsion.
Express statutory provisions that required a caution to be administered in equivalent circumstances were contained in the `Rules Relating to Statements From Accused Persons` inserted in the CPC [Cap 113, 1970 Ed] in 1960, known as the `Schedule E` rules. Rule 6 of Schedule E expressly required the accused in custody to be cautioned that he was not obliged to say anything. 
 
The caution to be administered to a prisoner when he is formally charged shall be in the following words - `Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence.`
 
 
 
However these rules were revoked by Act No 10 of 1976. The history of this legislation has recently been dealt with by this Court in 
Mohamed Bachu Miah & anor v Public Prosecutor
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 249
  , and the conclusion was [at p 265]: 
 
What then is the effect of the repeal of the previous proviso (b) to s 121(5), that is, the inadmissibility of a statement by a person under arrest which was not recorded in substantial compliance with Schedule E ... ? As stated before, in the context of s 121(5) as it stood before the 1976 amendment, the proviso operated as a limitation on the general scope of that provision. We have stated that s 121(5) was intended to apply to statements made by a person while under police custody; otherwise there would have been no need to impose restrictions of the kind set out in the proviso. If this is the correct construction of s 121(5), as we think it is, then the repeal of the second limb of the proviso could not have further restricted the scope of that subsection. On the contrary, it can only mean that the applicability of s 121(5) is further widened and that the only circumstance where a statement made by an accused, whether in police custody or not, may not be admitted in evidence is where it is tainted by inducement, threat or promise.
 
 
 
The removal of the restriction against the admission of statements made by a person under arrest if such statement were not recorded in substantial compliance with Schedule E, and in particular for present purposes with rule 6, was therefore in our judgment intended to render such statements admissible so long as they are not tainted by inducement, threat or promise. For these reasons we answered the first question in the negative.
In so doing, it must follow that the second question should also be answered in the negative. There are, however, other independent reasons contributing to this. Article 9(1) of the Constitution does not in fact refer to a `right of silence` or a `privilege against self-incrimination`. Indeed there is no specific constitutional or statutory provision protecting such a `right` or such a `privilege`. Article 9(1) provides: 
 
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
 
 
 
Its reverse side is that a person may be deprived of life or personal liberty in accordance with law. The deprivation of life and personal liberty subsequent to conviction is provided for in the penal statutory provisions. In the process of achieving such conviction, police officers must also act in accordance with law. For the purposes of this reference, the question then is whether a case falls outside art 9(1) when police officers exercise the power to examine a person and to compel him to answer questions if at the same time they fail to observe the precautions in s 121, and in particular one of these precautions, the exception clause in s 121(2).

  the Privy Council held that the word `law` in art 9(1) includes the principles of natural justice. However, the right of silence has never been regarded as subsumed under the principles of natural justice. It is a rule which originated as being largely evidential in nature. To say that the right of silence is a constitutional right would be to elevate an evidential rule to constitutional status despite its having been given no explicit expression in the Constitution. Such an elevation requires in the interpretation of art 9(1) a degree of adventurous extrapolation which we do not consider justified. It is not a mere matter of balancing the prejudice to the administration of justice resulting from depriving the court of relevant and important evidence against the interest protected by this right.
As to precisely what this interest is, it is pertinent to recall that the origin of the maxim 
 nemo tenebatur prodere seipsum 
(no one is obliged to betray himself) was a deep-seated public and general revulsion in England, after the Star Chamber was abolished in 1641, against all practices associated with it. One of these practices was to summon a defendant and compulsorily administer an oath to him on pain of whipping, fine and pillory, obliging him to be examined and to answer questions, a procedure which on occasion led to the forcible extraction of confessions by torture without any proof against the defendant to start with. The administration of an oath to a defendant thereby became so subliminally abhorrent that after the passing of the Star Chamber it came to be regarded as contrary to the law of God and of nature to force anyone to swear against himself.
However, many rules of criminal procedure and evidence which have developed since those days, in England as well as in other jurisdictions, have been directed at reducing or removing altogether the risk of unreliable confessions being extracted by force and used against their makers. This is what the safeguards in s 122(5) of the CPC and s 24 of the Evidence Act are aimed at. That being so, what remains of the dangers which 
 nemo tenebatur prodere seipsum 
 used to nullify, which justifies according it constitutional status? In our opinion, this rule would have been given specific Parliamentary expression if the legislature had intended to guarantee full protection for it, just as it has guaranteed, for example in art 9(3), the right of a person arrested to be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and his right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
Moreover, s 122(6) and s 123(1) of the CPC expressly derogate from the accused`s entitlement to withhold relevant information before trial: 
 
 
 
 
(122) (6) Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect: 
 
`You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for - [set ou 
 t 
charge]. Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.` ... 
 
(123) (1) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence evidence is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so charged or informed, as the case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer, and the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.
  
 
 
If this entitlement were a constitutional right protected by art 9(1) the provisions of s 122(6) and s 123(1) would be ultra vires and invalid. Yet in 
Sundram Jaykumal v PP
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 297
  the Privy Council held that these provisions were valid and constitutional, the implication for present purposes being that the said entitlement is not a constitutional right. For all these reasons we answered the second question in the negative.
In answer to the third question referred to us, the short answer is that since the first question has been answered in the negative, there is no reason why the admissibility under s 122(5) of a statement recorded under s 121 without the maker being expressly informed of a right of silence should be prejudiced solely because of this omission.
Section 121 of the CPC does not concern admissibility; it is not conceptually connected in any way with s 122 though as a matter of empirical fact many s 121 statements are subsequently admitted in evidence at trial after passing the test in s 122(5).
By virtue of s 122(1), statements made to police officers in the course of a police investigation are only admissible under s 122 (with the exception of statements made under s 141, which are not relevant for this case); ignoring for present purposes the rather special cases dealt with in ss 122(2), (3) and (4), the third question may thus be rephrased as an inquiry into whether a police statement fails the s 122(5) test for admissibility if the accused is not told beforehand of his entitlement to refrain from saying that which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. Section 122(5) provides: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit:
 
 
 
Provided that the court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
Our attention has not been drawn to any evidential penalties prescribed anywhere for a failure by an investigating officer to comply with s 121. More accurately, it appears that if a police officer fails to comply with s 121 he, not the accused, feels the effects of the breach. He may be liable in civil proceedings for breach of statutory duty, or a complaint may be made about him to the appropriate disciplinary tribunal, or he may be found guilty of a minor offence under s 225C of the Penal Code. However none of these courses of action has any effect on the admissibility and evidential value as against the accused of the statement thus obtained. Admissibility is still governed by s 122. Evidential value as against the accused is still a matter of fact in the circumstances of his case.
The Evidence Act is especially pertinent in this regard. Section 24 of that Act provides: 
 
A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him. This section therefore has much the same effect as the proviso to the present s 122(5) of the CPC, except that it applies generally and so is especially significant today for statements not recorded by police officers, and is limited to confessions. Section 29 provides that a confession that is otherwise relevant under s 24 of that Act ... does not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such confession and that evidence of it might be given against him.
 
 
 
The boundary between the relevancy of evidence and the methods employed in obtaining such evidence is thus clearly demonstrated. Not only is there apparently no evidential penalty prescribed for a failure to inform the person questioned that he is not bound to incriminate himself, but it would appear that there is express statutory provision permitting a statement thus obtained to be used in evidence. We therefore also answered the third question in the negative.
We would add that the admissibility of evidence obtained in breach of s 121 fortifies our conclusion on the second question that, according to law, a person may be deprived of life or personal liberty even in these circumstances; that for such reason alone there is no breach of such a person`s constitutional rights.
However, it is crucial for us to go further with regard to the third question. The first accused in this case was treated somewhat differently from the accused in other cases such as 
Tan Ho Teck
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 264
  and 
Chandran
 
[1989] 3 CLASNEWS 11
 In 
Tan Ho Teck
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 264
  it was not argued that a power of compulsion had been exercised in the taking of the disputed statement; in 
Chandran
 
[1989] 3 CLASNEWS 11
 the situation was much the same, for, apart from the issue of voluntariness which went to the s 122(5) test of admissibility, the remaining challenge was simply that the warning was not administered. Here, when the first accused in this case gave his further statements the interpreter, instead of saying nothing, read out to him the first half of the normal s 121(2) rubric, leaving out the second half. Thus, not only was the first accused`s entitlement to keep silent about anything that might incriminate himself left unsaid, but he was in addition actually told that he was bound to tell all the truth.
Despite s 29 of the Evidence Act, we think that in the context of these facts it may be said that the failure to inform a person of his rights in circumstances where a positive duty has arisen to give such information may amount to an inducement within the meaning of the proviso to s 122 (5), because it would be reasonable to assume that such an omission might have caused that person to say what he might not otherwise have said. At least, we think a reasonable doubt could arise as to whether he would have said the same things if he had been informed that he was entitled to refrain from doing so. In short, the seeming lack of choice might be an inducement to follow the only course of action which apparently remains.
In 
 Seow Tai Keng v R 
 ,7 the Assistant Controller of Foreign Exchange recorded an incriminating statement from the accused in the purported exercise of powers given to him under Reg 29 of the Finance Regulations 1950. That section, however, restricted the use of the power to the achieving of two functions, neither of which was fulfilled by the questions asked in this case. Instead, the interpreter told the accused that he had to answer all the questions asked of him in relation to foreign exchange matters. Brown J held that the Assistant Controller had exceeded his powers under Reg 29 in taking that statement. In deciding the consequences of this breach he said, without reference to s 29 of the Evidence Ordinance then in force, which was in similar terms to the present s 29 of the Evidence Act: 
 
... the appellant was induced to make this statement in the erroneous belief that he was bound by law to make it and could be punished if he did not. For that reason that statement was inadmissible under s 24 of the Evidence Ordinance.
 
 
 
Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance is now s 24 of the Evidence Act, which, it has already been pointed out, resembles closely the proviso to the present s 122(5) of the CPC. Therefore the exercise of powers of compulsion coupled with silence as to the limitations of those powers might create a positive misrepresentation of the rights of the person questioned, which may amount to inducement for the purposes of admissibility. In our opinion, that case is far too similar to the present case to be credibly distinguished.
Section 29 of the Evidence Act does not in our view extend to such a situation because it refers to the type of situation which prevailed in 
 Tan Ho Teck 
 1 and 
 Chandran 
 ,2 and not to a situation in which the investigating officer positively creates in the person questioned an inaccurate impression of his rights. True, the section expressly protects the relevancy of a confession obtained as a result of a deception practised on an accused person for the purpose of obtaining that confession. However, this in our opinion refers to a deception in the form of a factual situation such as that which might be engineered by an agent provocateur, not to a deception by positive misrepresentation of the law.
In 
 Tsang Yuk Chung v PP 
 8 the investigating officer read the charge and the s 122(6) warning to the accused but did not explain them. The interpreter translated this word for word, also without further explanation. At pp 266-267, the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
 
Section 122(6) does not provide for the admissibility of the statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation. That s 122(5) governs the admissibility of statements made under s 122(6) is confirmed by s 122(7) ... In our opinion, non-compliance with s 122(6) results not in a statement being inadmissible - since, as we have said, its admissibility depends on s 122(5) - but in enabling the court having to take such non-compliance into consideration in considering what inferences, if any at all, should be drawn from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts ... .
 
 
 
The court then went on to consider the requirement that the notice in writing `shall be explained`. It identified two possible problems in this regard. The first problem concerned what the mandatory explanation should consist of. The second problem was stated by the court to be the following: 
 
A ... possible problem is that, unlike the notice in writing, the mandatory explanations do not seem to be exempted by s 122(7) from being any inducement, threat or promise as is described in the proviso to s 122(5) ... .
 
 
 
The implication of this point is that the s 122(6) warning is only saved from being an inducement, threat or promise by s 122(7) so that the bare words of that warning are in fact capable of amounting to such inducement, threat or promise but are statutorily and therefore artificially deemed not to because of s 122(7).
The court finally came to the conclusion that the requirement `shall be explained` in s 122(6) was satisfied: 
 
if an accused person is told in general terms what the charge and warning mean. Since accused persons differ in background, what form the explanation should take must ultimately depend on the facts of each case.
 
 
 
The warning prescribed in s 122(6) is to the effect that if there is any fact on which the accused intends to rely in his defence in court he is advised to mention it at once, and if he holds it back till he goes to court it may be less likely to be believed and that could have a bad effect on his case in general. This is in our opinion much less pressing than the rubric read out by the interpreter to the first accused in the present case, the effect of which was essentially that the first accused was obliged to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. If the warning prescribed in s 122(6) would, but for s 122(7), constitute an inducement, threat or promise, a fortiori so would the words of the interpreter in the present case, and there is no saving equivalent of s 122(7) for statements not given pursuant to a s 122(6) warning.
Accordingly the answers to the questions referred are: 
 
 
(1) a suspect or an accused need not be expressly informed of a right to remain silent whenever any statement is recorded from him pursuant to s 121(2) of the CPC; 
 
(2) a failure to so inform him is not a breach of his constitutional rights under art 9(1) of the Constitution; and 
 
(3) a statement recorded from a suspect or an accused under s 121(1) and sought to be admitted in evidence under the provisions of s 122(5) may be so admitted even if no caution has been read to him in terms of s 121(2); but if, in addition to these circumstances, he was told at the time he made the statement that he was bound to state truly everything he knew concerning the case, such statement may not be admitted by reason of his having been induced to make it, within the meaning of s 122(5).

 Introduction 
 
 
 
(a) Background
The plaintiffs (`Pertamina`), an Indonesian state enterprise, were created by Law No 8 of 1971 of the Republic of Indonesia. Their principal business was and is the exploration, processing and marketing of oil and natural gas and related projects. Being a dominant economic force in Indonesia at all material times, they also undertook major economic development projects at the direction of the government of the Republic of Indonesia and one such project was the construction of the infrastructure facilities for a massive steel works known as Krakatau Steel at Cilegon, West Java. Those steel works were owned and eventually operated by a company known as PT Krakatau Steel (`PTKS`) created on 31 August 1970 by Law No 8 of 1970. For the purposes of these proceedings, the contractors which constructed the infrastructure and provided the materials and services under several contracts signed in 1973 and 1974 in respect of the steel works and the infrastructure for the industrial site at Cilegon, West Java, Indonesia were Klockner Industrie Analagen GMBH (`Klockner`) and Siemens AG (`Siemens`). Another was Pertamina`s involvement in and their payments for the purchases of equipment in relation to two projects in the Batam Island, of which a little more will be said later.
General Haji Achmad Thahir (`General Thahir`) was employed by Pertamina and their statutory predecessors. During the period directly and more immediately material to these proceedings he held the office as the general assistant to the then president director of Pertamina, General Ibnu Sutowo (`General Sutowo`). He was appointed to that office with effect from 14 October 1968 until 23 July 1976 when he died, having succumbed to a heart attack. At all material times his salary totalled only about US$9,000 per year. By para 3 of the reamended statement of claim it is asserted that from at least June 1972 until his death, General Thahir `was authorized to contract` on behalf of Pertamina and/or by virtue of his position in Pertamina also on behalf of PTKS `and to deal with all ancillary matters including the negotiation and implementation of financial arrangements` in connection with principally the Krakatau steel project. Pertamina further assert that it was within his power and authority to arrange for creditors (including Klockner and Siemens) of the plaintiffs and PTKS to be paid. The last assertion of fact in para 3 of the reamended statement of claim is that General Thahir, by virtue of his relationship with General Sutowo, was in a position of influence with General Sutowo, particularly in relation to matters involving the construction works and the supply of goods and materials.
(b) 19 ACU deposits
It turned out that on 23 July 1976, when General Thahir died, there stood as having been deposited with the Singapore branch of the Sumitomo Bank, 17 separate and discrete ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks, all in the name of `Mr HA Thahir and/or Mrs KR Thahir`; their aggregate was DM53,972,374.12 and as from 23 July 1976 their maturity dates ranged between a few days and just over four months. In addition, there were two other separate and discrete ACU deposits, one on time deposit to mature on 18 August 1976 and the other on demand, which were denominated in US dollars in the sums of US$593,249.31 and US$608,959.42 respectively. These two ACU deposits totalled US$1,202,208.73. All these ACU deposits have to be analysed in much greater detail later in this judgment when dealing with the issues of fact and law. At this stage of reciting briefly the material facts, I need only state the following introductory matters. First, the expression `Mrs KR Thahir` in all the 19 ACU deposits refers to the first defendant, Kartika Ratna Thahir (hereinafter called `Mrs Kartika Thahir`) who by her defence alleges that she is the lawful widow of General Thahir, having lived with him as man and wife since 1969. Secondly, it is common ground (a) that the moneys in all 19 ACU deposits were, at all material times, in separate designated joint deposit accounts of both General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir; (b) that the relationship between Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch of the one part and General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir of the other part is governed by the law of Singapore under which their relationship is contractual in nature and they are respectively debtors/creditors with the attendant obligations and rights; and (c) that barring disputes, of the nature and type as we have seen in these proceedings, Mrs Kartika Thahir on the death of General Thahir would have become solely entitled to all the moneys in the 19 ACU deposits. Thirdly, on 30 March 1992 counsel for Sumitomo Bank tendered to me a letter dated 28 March 1992 and a bundle of the bank`s documents relating to the said ACU deposits. These documents indicated that as of 27 March 1992 the total of the said ACU deposits including the interest, which had accrued during the intervening period, was US$81,757,260.74. I was further informed that on 30 June 1981, at the requests of and pursuant to the agreement of all parties concerned, the two ACU deposits in US dollars remained in US dollars and the 17 separate ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks were converted into a single US dollar account which continued to earn interest.
Three days after the death of General Thahir, Mr Mustapha Thahir and another brother, both sons of General Thahir by an earlier marriage, called at the Djakarta representative office of Sumitomo Bank. They claimed that all the ACU deposits in question belonged to the estate of the deceased. Mr Mustapha Thahir at the same time `directed` the chief representative of the representative office to freeze the ACU deposits `until such time as the respective interests in the estate had been determined`. The general manager of Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch was informed of these demands on 26 July 1976 by telex. Not unexpectedly, Mrs Kartika Thahir was not idle either. On 27 July 1976 at about noon and again at 4pm, she personally called on Mr Akira Fujimine, General Manager of Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch. She demanded payment to her of four sums, namely, DM3,287,591.13, DM2,364,187.60, DM2,659,204.26 and US$608,959.42. She further demanded that the balance of the said ACU deposits be transferred to her sole name. At about 2pm the same day, Mr Ibrahim Thahir, one of the children of General Thahir by an earlier marriage, called on Mr Akira Fujimine. Mr Ibrahim Thahir directed Sumitomo Bank, Singapore branch not to pay out any moneys to Mrs Kartika Thahir from the said ACU deposits until the respective beneficial interests of Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate of General Thahir were determined. Mr Ibrahim Thahir called on the bank again the following day, on 28 July 1976. He was accompanied by Mr Abubakar Thahir and Mr Faruk Thahir. They are all sons of General Thahir by an earlier marriage. They repeated their earlier demands.
On the same day the solicitors of Sumitomo Bank received a letter dated 28 July 1976 from Messrs Drew & Napier, the solicitors of Mrs Kartika Thahir. The letter pointed out the legal rights of Mrs Kartika Thahir and the clear and undoubted obligation on the part of the bank to pay Mrs Kartika Thahir. The letter in its penultimate paragraph volunteered information as follows: 
 
Insofar as it is relevant our client has informed us that she has now been permitted to operate similar ACU joint deposit accounts by the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, and your client bank is the only bank which has refused her the rights to operate the accounts.
 
 
 
It would appear that Mrs Kartika Thahir had told her solicitors that she had similar ACU joint deposit accounts in two other banks in Singapore.
(c) The interpleader proceedings
Faced with these competing claims, Sumitomo Bank sought interpleader reliefs and commenced these originating summons on 30 July 1976 under O 17 r 1(1)(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (`the RSC`). Mrs Kartika Thahir was named as the first defendant and Messrs Abubakar Thahir, Ibrahim Thahir and Faruk Thahir were named collectively as the second defendants. The plaintiff bank sought an order that the first and second defendants appear and state the nature and particulars of their respective claims to the said ACU deposits in dispute and maintain or relinquish the same and abide by such order as may be made in these proceedings. By an order of court dated 4 February 1977, Messrs Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir were appointed to represent the estate of General Thahir for the purposes of these proceedings. The title of these proceedings were consequently amended.
On 6 May 1977 the then solicitors of Pertamina wrote a letter to Sumitomo Bank. They referred to the interpleader proceedings which the bank had commenced in connection with the ACU deposits held by them. They gave notice to the bank that Pertamina was also claiming to be entitled to the ACU deposits `as they were moneys wrongfully acquired by [General Thahir] by way of bribes while employed by [Pertamina] and contrary to his duty as employee of [Pertamina]`. They further gave notice of intended action. In response, Sumitomo Bank applied to the High Court for Pertamina to be joined as a defendant. By an order of the then Chief Justice made on 24 June 1977, Pertamina was added as a defendant in these proceedings. By an order of the High Court dated 12 March 1980, Pertamina was ordered to be the plaintiffs in these proceedings and that Mrs Kartika Thahir of the one part and the estate of General Thahir of the second part shall be the first and second defendants respectively.
On 20 March 1981 all three parties came to an agreement as to the terms of the issues between them. Those terms were approved by the High Court. They were as follows: 
 
The first issue
 
 
 
Between
 
 
 
Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina) added pursuant to order of court dated 24 June 1977 ... Plaintiffs
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
Kartika Ratna Thahir ... First defendant
 
 
 
Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir appointed by order of court dated 4 February 1977 to represent the estate of Haji Achman Thahir and as HA Thahir bin H Muh Thaher and as in H Thaher, deceased ... Second defendants
 
 
 
Interpleader (first) issue
 
 
 
submitted on 21 March 1981 by Mak, Pala, Selvadurai & Tan, solicitors for the abovenamed plaintiffs in the issue pursuant to the orders of court dated 11 and 12 March 1980 Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the first and second defendants deny, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposits and interest or proceeds in the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir on one or more of the grounds following: 
(a) belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise; 
(c) as being moneys held and received to the plaintiffs` use; 
(d) being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of contract by the said HA Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs; 
(e) that the first defendant having assisted the said HA Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee thereto.
 
 
 
And in the event that the court finds in favour of the plaintiffs the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs.
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
In the matter of a second issue ordered to be tried
 
 
 
The second issue
 
 
 
Between
 
 
 
Abubakar Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir appointed by order of court dated 4 February 1977 to represent the estate of Haji Achman Thahir and as HA Thaher bin H Muh Thaher and as in H Thaher, deceased ... Plaintiffs in the second issue
 
 
 
And
 
 
 
Kartika Ratna Thahir ... Defendant in the second issue
 
 
 
Interpleader (second) issue
 
 
 
submitted on 20 March 1981 by Braddell Brothers, solicitors for the abovenamed plaintiffs in the second issue pursuant to the orders of court dated 11 and 12 March 1980 and 2 February 1981 Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the defendant denies, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposit and interest or proceeds deposited with the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir on one or more of the grounds following: 
(a) that the said moneys belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) that the defendant holds the same on trust for the estate of Haji Achman Thahir, deceased; 
(c) by virtue of an agreement dated 13 August 1976 the defendant held upon trust 1U2 of the said moneys and interest for the said estate of Haji Achman Thahir, deceased.
 
 
 
And in the event that the court finds in favour of the plaintiffs (on both issues) the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs. And in the event that the court finds in favour of the defendant (on both issues) the said moneys (and interest) be paid out to the order of the defendant.
 
 
 
The second interpleader issue as set out above is between the estate of General Thahir on the one hand and Mrs Kartika Thahir on the other. By agreement, it was not dealt with by me during the trial. This agreement was sensible and logical because the matters in dispute under the second interpleader issue will only arise in the event this court decides wholly, or in part, in favour of Mrs Kartika Thahir.
(d) The amended first issue
By an order of the High Court made on 2 December 1988, the first issue was amended as italicized in the following terms: 
 
Whether as the plaintiffs affirm and the first and second defendants deny, the plaintiffs are entitled to the moneys being the ACU deposits and interest or proceeds in the Sumitomo Bank Ltd (`the said moneys`) in the names of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir 
 and whether such entitlement arises either under the law of the Republic of Singapore as the governing law and/or under the law of Indonesia as the law of the place having most connection with the rights, obligations and duties of the persons hereinafter referred to on one or more of the grounds following
: 
(a) belong to the plaintiffs absolutely; 
(b) are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise; 
(c) as being moneys held and received to the plaintiffs` use; 
(d) being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of contract by the said HA Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs; 
(e) that the first defendant having assisted the said HA Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee thereto.
 
 
 
(e) The pleadings
It is now convenient to consider the pleadings. This exercise at this stage, though somewhat extensive, will achieve the principal purpose of seeing how the issues between the parties are defined when the trial finally began in earnest on 20 January 1992. In addition, it will refer in essential terms to both Pertamina`s and Mrs Kartika Thahir`s material assertions of facts and how each assertion had evolved, against which this court can at the conclusion of the trial evaluate, assess and make findings based on the direct oral and documentary evidence which were led and produced on behalf of Pertamina and make reasonable inferences based on and drawn from certain primary facts, so far as Pertamina`s case is concerned. So far as Mrs Kartika Thahir`s case is concerned, expert evidence of two witnesses were called on her behalf to give evidence on the fact of the laws of Indonesia. She did not herself enter the witness box to give any evidence. In the result, her allegations of facts which have to be proved to make good her defences were not proved at all.
The first issue between Pertamina and Mrs Kartika Thahir, which was not in terms pleaded as such, is the question as to which system or systems of law should govern the resolution of the disputes between them. Mr Hunt on behalf of Pertamina puts at the forefront of his submissions that all disputes in this case are to be determined by the law of Singapore and it is a necessary corollary of this submission that the law of Indonesia is not at all applicable. Alternatively,
Mr Hunt submits that the issues in this case are to be determined by a combination of the law of Indonesia, of which a very limited part will come into play, and the law of Singapore. On this submission, it would be necessary to draw the line. He says there are two approaches. First, he says remedy is for the lex fori. If this is the correct approach in law, then every issue between the parties above the remedy line is to be resolved by reference to the law of Indonesia. Secondly, and this is an alternative he says should be applied, this court should only refer to the law of Indonesia to determine the sole question whether the conduct of General Thahir is lawful or unlawful and the inexorable consequence as a matter of conflict of laws is that all other questions, eg whether General Thahir was a fiduciary of Pertamina, whether he breached his fiduciary duties and questions on the law of property, are to be determined by reference to the law of Singapore.
Mr Eder, on the other hand, emphatically disagrees and contends that as a matter of conflict of laws, Pertamina`s claims must fail unless they can establish a proprietary claim against all the 19 ACU deposits, including the accumulated interest, under 
 both 
 the law of Indonesia and the law of Singapore. This prefatory paragraph on the conflict of laws issues which arise in this case will be followed later in this judgment by, it is hoped, a more extensive and intensive analysis of the relevant jurisprudence. According to the pleadings, the establishment and business of Pertamina are admitted by both Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate of General Thahir. In a case of this nature, the factual questions which relate to the position, authority and powers of General Thahir within Pertamina, and the critical role which he played with regard to the Krakatau steel project have to be carefully investigated. By paras 2 and 3 of the re-reamended statement of claim (`the statement of claim`), Pertamina assert that at all material times from at least 1967 until his death on 23 July 1976 General Thahir was employed as a senior official and executive officer of Pertamina and of their predecessors in title. Pertamina say that from time to time, General Thahir held the positions of (a) general assistant to the then president director, General Ibnu Sutowo; (b) acting director of finance; (c) acting treasurer; and (d) a director of Petra Jasa, which office does not feature in this case and will not be mentioned again. Pertamina further assert by para 3 of the statement of claim that from at least June 1972 until his death, General Thahir was authorized to contract on behalf of the plaintiffs `and/or (by virtue of his position with [Pertamina] on behalf of PT Krakatau Steel [ie PTKS] and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel` and to deal with all ancillary matters including the negotiation and implementation of financial arrangements in connection with such contracts. The phrase within the quotation marks were added by amendments which this court allowed at the commencement of the trial. Pertamina further assert that General Thahir was also charged with the duty of supervising the due execution and performance of all the contracts referred to and that it was within his power and authority to arrange for creditors of Pertamina, PTKS and PT Krakatau Ferrosteel, which creditors included Klockner and Siemens, to be paid. By an amendment allowed by this court at the commencement of this trial, Pertamina also make the important assertion that General Thahir was, by virtue of his relationship with General Sutowo and as the latter`s general assistant, in a position of influence with the then president director, General Sutowo, particularly in relation to matters involving construction works and the supply of goods and materials.
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s responses are as follows. By para 3 of the further re-reamended defence (`the defence`) she says that General Thahir `was employed as his personal general assistant` by Pertamina`s then president director, General Sutowo. Apart from this assertion, which obviously suggests that General Thahir`s role was minimal and personal to General Sutowo, she denies the thrust of para 2 of the statement of claim. By para 4 of her defence she denies para 3 of the statement of claim but she says that, save at the request of General Sutowo, General Thahir occasionally oversaw the execution of projects in order to report thereon to General Sutowo. She specifically denies the allegations that General Thahir had any authority to contract on behalf of Pertamina or by virtue of his position with Pertamina to contract on behalf of PTKS or any authority to arrange for Klockner and Siemens to be paid. The estate of General Thahir essentially adopts the assertions of this part of Mrs Kartika Thahir`s defence.
Having made assertions on General Thahir`s employment with Pertamina, his authority and powers, and in particular his role in the Krakatau steel project, Pertamina then deal with the legal consequences of the capacities which General Thahir held under the law of Indonesia and the law of Singapore. Pertamina claim that General Thahir as their director, agent and/or servant owed them `duties and/or` fiduciary duties which are seven-fold. They are, omitting those parts which later turned out to be irrelevant, as follows: (i) to serve Pertamina loyally, diligently and faithfully; (ii) not to accept bribes from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf; (iii) not to use his fiduciary position of trust to acquire any unauthorized benefits for himself; (iv) not to allow his duty to Pertamina to conflict with his personal interests; (v) not to make any personal profit from the use and/or abuse of confidential information which was imparted to him or which he acquired in the course of his duties to Pertamina, nor to cause or permit any such profit to be made for the benefit of anyone other than Pertamina; (vi) to preserve Pertamina`s property and/or assets and not to use or permit the same to be used for any purpose whatsoever otherwise than for Pertamina; and (vii) to pay to Pertamina immediately upon receipt by him all bribes or secret payments or commissions obtained by him (in breach of his duty set out in item (ii) above) from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf. At the end of para 4 of the statement of claim, Pertamina contend that according to both Indonesian and Singapore law, the phrase `[Pertamina`s] property` includes their private and/or confidential information which included information relating to their financial position and prospects. The allegation in this connection is that at the material period Pertamina was in serious financial predicament, and with that knowledge, General Thahir took steps and ensured that Klockner and Siemens were paid in preference to other creditors of Pertamina and/or PTKS. To give a fuller picture as to how the pleadings had evolved, it should be noted that the phrase `duties and/or` mentioned earlier also in this paragraph was added to para 4 of the statement of claim by an amendment allowed by this court at the commencement of the trial. More importantly, it should be noted that the duty itemized as (vii), which was also an amendment allowed at the commencement of the trial, is a duty which was added by Pertamina to foreshadow and underpin Pertamina`s contention that even if
Mr Eder is right in law that Pertamina has to establish a proprietary claim to all 19 ACU deposits under the law of Indonesia, such a claim is a proprietary claim as Pertamina`s experts on the law of Indonesia would opine in evidence at the trial.
Mrs Kartika Thahir denies para 4 of the statement of claim and specifically denies that General Thahir was Pertamina`s director and/or agent or that he held a fiduciary position or had fiduciary duties as alleged. She also denies that private and/or confidential information is capable of constituting Pertamina`s property. By voluntary further and better particulars filed on 25 September 1991, Mr Eder on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir makes a number of assertions under three categories. First and generally, Mrs Kartika Thahir says that General Thahir`s contract of employment with Pertamina was governed by Indonesian law and General Thahir`s duties principally arose out of the employment contract and certain statutory provisions. She further asserts that custom and decisions of Indonesian courts and administrative (labour) tribunals are potential sources of the law relating to an employee`s duties. Secondly, as to the employment contract, she accepts that the employment contract is the primary source of any employee`s duties including any company rules generally applicable to employees and incorporated into the contract by reference. There was, she says in this case, no such written contract. Thirdly, she refers to Indonesian statutory provisions. Under this head, she makes five assertions, viz (i) the Indonesian Civil Code contains general provisions affecting all agreements, eg arts 1338 and 1339. It also creates, eg art 1603a-d, certain statutory duties owed by an employee to an employer; (ii) generally, an employer will have a claim for damages against an employee for breach of contract or the statutory duties under art 1365. Breach of such provisions may entitle the employer to claim damages against the employee for loss actually suffered and Mr Eder underscores the principle of Indonesian law that there is no presumption of loss under Indonesian law; (iii) there is no concept of `fiduciary duties` in the employer-employee relationship and that there is no generally applicable concept of `fiduciary` or `trust` in Indonesian law; (iv) Indonesia has no Civil Code sections and no established case law permitting recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment beyond that which is provided in arts 1360-1362 of the Civil Code; and (v) under Indonesian law, private and confidential information cannot be Pertamina`s property. These wide-ranging questions of Indonesian law will have to await elucidation when I come to consider the expert evidence led by both sides. The estate of General Thahir in its defence substantially adopted the denials and assertions of Mrs Kartika Thahir.
Mr Hunt on behalf of Pertamina successfully applied for the addition of para 4A to the statement of claim in late 1991 where he gave notice of this additional para 4A, and of three other additional paragraphs, which were also added as `A` paragraphs which I will shortly come to later in this judgment, when Pertamina`s application to amend was filed. As they were necessary to define all issues between the parties, all of which should be dealt with at the trial, the amendments were allowed. All four additional paragraphs, namely, paras 4A, 11A, 14A and 16A, were allowed as amendments by this court on 11 February 1992.
By para 4A of the statement of claim, Pertamina further allege that General Thahir was subject to, inter alia, (i) Indonesia Law No 3 of 1971 on the Control of Criminal Acts of Corruption and references are made to the specific articles of that statute as set out in para 5(4) of Pertamina`s reamended reply, which were set out and filed in court as early as 9 April 1981; (ii) Minister of Mines Regulation No 08/P/M/Pertamb/1968, in particular art 39(3) thereof; (iii) Minister of Mines Regulation No 02/P/PM/Pertamb/1971, in particular arts 8 and 9 thereof; and (iv) Presidential Decree No 10 of 1974, in particular arts 7 and 8 prohibiting the receipt of presents or gifts (save in certain exceptional circumstances which are irrelevant for the purposes of this case). Accordingly, Pertamina assert that General Thahir was obliged by the law of Indonesia to refrain from any act prejudicial to Pertamina and, in particular, from committing any act or omission by which he enriched himself at the expense of Pertamina or to the detriment of Pertamina or by virtue of his office with Pertamina. The paragraph goes on to assert that General Thahir was obliged in every respect to act in good faith, to refrain from corruption of any sort and from disloyalty to Pertamina by breach of confidence or otherwise and to refrain from receiving moneys from those with whom he dealt in the course of his duties on Pertamina`s behalf.
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s response is to make no admission of the enactments, regulations or decree and to deny the rest of para 4A of the statement of claim. In specific reference to those contracts entered into by PTKS and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel (which she refers to as the `non-Pertamina contracts`), she specifically denies that General Thahir owed any of the duties set out in paras 4 and 4A of the statement of claim.
Paragraph 5 of the statement of claim turns to the position of Mrs Kartika Thahir. Pertamina base their allegations on what Mrs Kartika Thahir had herself alleged. It is averred that Mrs Kartika Thahir alleges that she is the lawful widow of General Thahir and between 1969 and his death had lived with him as his wife and, more materially for the purposes of Pertamina, she had a close and intimate knowledge of his personal dealings and financial affairs, as would be described later in the statement of claim. Mrs Kartika Thahir by para 6 of her defence admits and avers Pertamina`s assertions in this part of the statement of claim. Pertamina obviously place importance on her admission and affirmation by which she admits and affirms that she had a close and intimate knowledge of General Thahir`s personal dealings and financial affairs. As will be seen later, Pertamina go further to make the far more serious and specific allegation that she had knowledge of and/or was privy to General Thahir`s acts of corruption and receipt of the bribes. It should be noted that Pertamina are not concerned with the question whether she is the lawful wife of General Thahir, which is a question that will be relevant at the trial, if any, of the second issue between her and the estate in these proceedings.
The next paragraph of the statement of claim is not controversial. It refers to the appointment by the High Court of the two sons of General Thahir by
Mrs Rukiah Thahir to represent the estate in its claims to the ACU deposits.
By para 7 of the statement of claim Pertamina deals with the position of General Thahir in relation to the Krakatau steel project. They say he was the main policy-maker together with the then president director of Pertamina or alternatively was in a position to influence and/or did influence the policy decisions of the then president director in relation to that particular project, in connection with which the alleged bribes were given by the two German contractors. They say, in particular, that General Thahir was responsible for the conduct of the negotiations, conclusion and implementation of the contracts of the project and was also responsible for the progress and other payments to, inter alia, Klockner and Siemens. So far as the contracts were concerned, Pertamina gave further and better particulars. They say that the contracts were as follows: (1) the hot steel mill contract of June 1974 with Ferrostaal AG, and in fairness to that contractor, it was made clear that Pertamina do not say that it is also their case that they had given any bribe; (2) the steel slab plant of May 1974 with Ferrostaal AG; (3) the purchase contract dated 29 March 1973 between Pertamina and Siemens, the contract value of which was DM36,941,000; (4) the extension of generation and power distribution plant of 4 May 1974 with Siemens, the contract value of which was DM573,703,700; (5) the grinding and palletizing plant with Ferrostaal AG of June 1974; and (6) the contract with Klockner dated 23 January 1974, the contract value of which was DM553,500,000. Pertamina also assert by their further and better particulars that General Thahir used to give oral instructions to one Nur Usman to make the payments to the contractors, including Klockner and Siemens.
Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the allegation and says that General Thahir`s role was to assist General Sutowo who, she says, was second only to the President of the Republic of Indonesia and he was `Pertamina`. On Pertamina`s requests,
Mrs Kartika Thahir alleges that General Sutowo was the second most powerful and influential man in Indonesia and had such a control over the affairs of Pertamina that his actions and knowledge were the actions and knowledge of Pertamina and that, in the premises, she invites the court to pierce the corporate veil.
Paragraph 8 of the statement of claim usefully and compendiously sets out the material particulars of the 19 ACU deposits, which are the subject matter of the claims in this case. It refers to the fact that the ACU deposits were made on the dates indicated. A schedule to this paragraph sets out the sums and the order each ACU deposit was made in Deutschmarks and United States dollars. The schedule referred to in para 8 is annexed hereto and marked `Annexure A`.
I should interpose by referring to an item appearing near the middle portion of the schedule. It refers to the sum of DM7.5m which was withdrawn by General Thahir. As had subsequently transpired, General Thahir had paid this sum to General Sutowo who, after investigations by the authorities in Indonesia, eventually repaid this sum to Pertamina. Mrs Kartika Thahir relies on the fact and size of this transaction to substantiate her allegation that General Sutowo knew of the commissions General Thahir was receiving and for her contention that General Sutowo`s knowledge and consent were those of Pertamina. Pertamina`s response is two-fold: first, General Sutowo was a co-delinquent with General Thahir, by reason of which their wrongful acts will invalidate or nullify any consent which might have been given by General Sutowo to accept the bribes and cannot possibly bind Pertamina; and, secondly, this transaction underlines the influence and intimate relationship between General Sutowo and General Thahir who Klockner and Siemens perceived as important and effective enough as a conduit to get through to General Sutowo as to pay him what Mr Hunt observes was a king`s ransom. In connection with this matter, it is fair to observe that Mr Eder quite properly draws the court`s attention to the fact that Pertamina had the documents since 1982 and had consistently denied that General Sutowo was involved for some eight years before the transaction was disclosed in these proceedings.
Pertamina indicate that they will rely on the admissions contained in
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s solicitors` letter to Sumitomo Bank dated 28 July 1976.
Mrs Kartika Thahir in reply seeks to point out that the reference to an account with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was an error of her then solicitors. She also claims that since the ACU deposits were held in joint names, she became the owner of or solely entitled to the ACU deposits upon the death of General Thahir by operation of law.
We now come to the pivotal issue of fact whether the ACU deposits were the proceeds of General Thahir`s misappropriation of Pertamina`s money and/or property and/or were the proceeds of bribes and/or secret commissions paid to him by Klockner and Siemens. Pertamina`s allegations on these central issues are set out in para 9 of the statement of claim and, in view of their importance and a number of facts and matters upon which Pertamina rely as constituting the pith and substance of their case against Mrs Kartika Thahir, it is reproduced below: 
 
The sums represented by the aforesaid ACU deposits originated in whole or in part from the proceeds of the misappropriation by Thahir of the plaintiffs` money and/or property and/or were in whole or in part the proceeds of bribes and/or secret commissions paid to or received by Thahir in his aforesaid capacities and in breach of the obligations set out in para 4 hereof.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs will rely upon (inter alia) the following facts and matters: 
 
 
(i) As appears from para 7 hereof, at all material times Thahir had the carriage on behalf of the plaintiffs of all matters related to the negotiation, execution and implementation of major contracts with (inter alios) Siemens and Klockner for works in Indonesia and in particular the Krakatau steel project. 
 
(ii) Thahir, in the capacities set forth in para 2, also played a major role in the negotiations of the financial arrangements (including loans) made in connection with the said contracts. 
 
(iii) The monthly salary paid to Thahir by the plaintiffs for the period May 1972 to the date of his death ranged from 157,500 Rupiahs (the equivalent of S$925.88 or US$328.33 at the then prevailing exchange rate) to 249,600 Rupiahs (S$1,468.24 or US$593.95 at the then prevailing exchange rate). At no time did Thahir`s annual salary or legitimate income as a full time officer, servant or agent of the plaintiffs exceed the equivalent Rupiahs 3,782,500 the equivalent of S$22,250, US$9,000 per annum. Furthermore Thahir was not possessed of any substantial assets, property or legitimate income from any other source. 
 
(iv) Thahir`s deposits since 1973 in ACU deposits at Sumitomo alone exceeded DM50m and US$1m. (The total equivalent in US$ of the aforesaid sums was at all material times not less than US$20m, that is to say more than 33,672 times his maximum monthly salary and 2,222 times his maximum annual salary.) The plaintiffs cannot particularize before discovery and/or the administration of interrogatories herein the deposits of funds elsewhere. 
 
(v) It is inconceivable that the said sums could have accrued legitimately to Thahir either from the salary paid by the plaintiffs to him or otherwise. Further at no time in the course of this litigation since 1977 have the defendants or any of them alleged or suggested any or any legitimate or lawful or proper source of the said funds or any or any legitimate or lawful or proper means by which the same were acquired. 
 
(vi) The currency of the account and payment in relation to the contracts specified in (i) hereof were in Deutschmarks and/or United States dollars. Deutschmarks and/or United States dollars were likewise the currency in which the ACU deposits aforesaid originated and were subsequently held. The plaintiffs will contend res ipsa loquitur and will if necessary further rely upon s 116 of the Singapore Evidence Act (Cap 97).
  
 
 
Further, the plaintiffs will if necessary rely on the following facts and matters: 
(vii) The said contracts provided for instalment and/or progress payments to be made to the contractors by the plaintiffs ... 
(viii) As shown in the schedule annexed hereto and marked [`Annexure B` which is headed `Summary of pairings identified using computerized comparison`], on the various dates set out in the column headed `Opening date` there were credited to Thahir the sums set out in the column headed `Gross deposit`. Each such sum was the stated percentage of the respective payment to a German contractor set out under the heading `Payments to German contractors`.
 
 
 
The statistical probability of the said payments and the said deposits not being temporarily and financially related is in excess of 1,000,000 : 1 against. [In the course of his opening, Mr Hunt informs me that the expert has revised the figure to 500,000 : 1, for which I shall go into the expert evidence later in this judgment.] 
(ix) From about the end of 1973 Thahir was possessed of confidential information that the plaintiffs` financial resources were strained and that its economic viability was in danger. Thahir well knew that there was a risk that the said contractors might not be paid the moneys due or to become due to them. Accordingly Thahir arranged for the said contractors to receive substantial sums from the plaintiffs when he and the said contractors well knew that such payments were in the nature of fraudulent preferences. Further or in the alternative Thahir arranged for payments to the said contractors (amongst others) to be given preference over payments to other creditors of the plaintiffs. For his services in this respect Thahir retained part of the funds over which he had control or alternatively he was rewarded by Siemens and/or Klockner by a payment of commission the proceeds whereof are represented in part by the ACU deposits, the subject of this claim. The best particulars the plaintiffs can give in this connection at this stage are those set out in (viii) above. 
(x) To facilitate the passing of money to Thahir both Siemens and Klockner made written requests to the treasurer for foreign currency of Pertamina, one Nur Usman, to change the conditions of payment under their said contracts to provide that letters of credit opened in favour of PT Siemens Indonesia with Dresdner Bank Singapore, 6 Shenton Way and in favour of Klockner Industrie Anlagen GMBH with the Dresdner Bank, Duisburg should provide beside the usual conditions the following clauses: `transferable more than once and outside Singapore` (Siemens letter dated 29 June 1974). `Irrevocable, transferable and divisible` (Klockner letter dated 22 February 1974). The plaintiffs will rely upon the said letters for their full terms and effect. 
(xi) The plaintiffs will contend that but for his death, Thahir would have attempted to obtain from, inter alios, Siemens a further DM15m. In April 1979 (and notwithstanding the impropriety thereof) Kartika was responsible for instituting attempts to obtain the said sums from Siemens. The best particulars the plaintiffs can give before discovery appear in para 15(x)-(xiii) hereunder.
 
 
 
Pertamina obviously have to establish on a balance of probabilities that all or substantially all of the 19 ACU deposits had emanated from, or are directly linked, to their payments to both Klockner and Siemens under their contracts with the two German contractors in relation to the Krakatau steel project or some other projects of Pertamina. By the evidence they will lead which is summarized in Annexure B, they say they will have established 
 11 matches 
 out of the 19 ACU deposits. As will be seen from a study of Annexure B, for the explanation of which I will refer to the expert evidence later, the 
 11 matches 
 amount to DM45,291,623.67. If the alleged 
 11 matches 
 are found to be correct in truth and in fact, they amount to 83.9% of the total ACU deposits of DM53,972,374.12.
Mr Eder in closing observes that only 
 11 
 of the 19 ACU deposits had been matched and this comment elicited from Mr Hunt the inevitable riposte that it is the aggregate quantum and not the number of matches that is more material and significant.
It is also convenient to observe at this stage that 
 Match 11 
 , as a result of discovery of documents in the course of the trial, was shown to be Siemens` 10% payment to General Thahir for Pertamina`s Diesel Electric Power Station and an airport in Batam Island, Indonesia. On behalf of Pertamina Mr Hunt emphasizes that this subsequent discovery confirms the accuracy of the investigative work of Pertamina`s experts and also points to the fact that General Thahir had his `finger in many pies`. He also hastens to point out that the 
 11 matches 
 cumulatively give rise to a strong inference that the rest of the DM ACU deposits were also bribes and that this inference standing by itself is more than reasonable, without this court having to consider all other evidence, including in particular the alleged admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir to General Benny Moerdani in Geneva, which point in the same direction.
In view of the breadth and depth of the allegations as set out in para 9 of the statement of claim and in the particulars in several sub-paragraphs, Mrs Kartika Thahir sought a number of further and better particulars. These particulars, which were given by Pertamina, should now be summarized. Mr Hunt`s comments will also be referred to from time to time. In relation to the particulars required to support Pertamina`s allegations of General Thahir`s misappropriation or receipt of bribes, Pertamina refer to another major plank of their case against Mrs Kartika Thahir. They say that Mrs Kartika Thahir in September 1977 in Geneva, Switzerland had admitted to General Benny Moerdani, now Minister of Defence and Security of Indonesia, that the ACU deposits consisted of payments made to General Thahir by Siemens and Klockner by way of bribes and/or commissions. In addition, Pertamina say that the facts speak for themselves and that they will rely on s 116 of the Singapore Evidence Act (Cap 5, 1970 Ed). On being asked for further and better particulars of the purposes for which the alleged bribes were paid to General Thahir, Pertamina say that they will invite the court to infer that the bribes were paid for the following purposes, viz (i) to ensure that Siemens and Klockner were given preferential treatment where payments were concerned, in view of the reducing resources of Pertamina in 1974 and 1975; and (ii) to allow Siemens and Klockner better contractual terms than they would have obtained if they had had to tender in competition for their work. Pertamina had originally alleged grossly excessive prices but this allegation of over-pricing was not allowed by this court to be revived as it had been abandoned at an earlier stage of these proceedings. Mr Hunt submits, however, that as a matter of Singapore law, it is irrelevant what General Thahir did for his German paymasters.
In relation to the alleged secret nature of the commissions paid to General Thahir, Mrs Kartika Thahir requires Pertamina to specify `who ought to have known but did not in fact know of them`. Although Mr Hunt describes this request as curious, Pertamina`s response is to say that the commissions were secret in the sense that they were received by General Thahir as an employee of Pertamina in breach of the duties of fidelity to them. They go on to say that the board of directors ought to have been made fully aware of them but were not and that, in any case, it would have been ultra vires the board to have approved such payments for General Thahir`s benefit.
I should now set out Mrs Kartika Thahir`s defence by reciting para 10 of her defence, which is in the following terms: 
 
The first sentence of para 9 of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that Thahir misappropriated the plaintiffs` money or property or that he was bribed, or that he received secret commissions as there alleged or at all. It was not a term of Thahir`s employment as general assistant to Sutowo that he should serve exclusively in that capacity. Thahir was free to supplement his said very small salary by remuneration earned in his private capacity. The fact that Thahir received income apart from his salary was not secret, but was known both to the plaintiffs, by inter alios their said president director, and to the plaintiffs` principal, the state government, who consented thereto.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
The first defendant will say that knowledge and consent must be inferred from the following facts and matters: 
(i) The amount of Thahir`s annual salary paid by the plaintiffs was known to (inter alios) Sutowo and to the President of Indonesia. 
(ii) Certain payments received by Thahir were remitted by him to Sutowo. Thus, on or about 10 June 1974, Thahir remitted to Sutowo DM7.5m. Sutowo kept a deposit account or accounts with the said Singapore branch of Sumitomo. On or about 
24 April 1975, Sutowo`s credit balance on one such account was DM8,017,152.52.
 
 
 
 
(iii) Since early 1974 Thahir kept a deposit account of about 200m Rupiah with the PT Pacific Bank of Jakarta of which Sutowo was and is the major shareholder. Thahir specifically kept a large deposit with the said bank in order to assist Sutowo in his banking interests.
  
 
 
 
(iv) Towards the end of 1974, Sutowo, Haji Yusuf and Thahir agreed to build a cement plant in Sumatra costing about DM50-60m. Sutowo and Thahir agreed to put up the finance out of their own resources in equal parts, the said Wibisowo agreed to act as managing director of the proposed cement plant company. Thahir agreed to provide his share of the finance out of the said ACU deposits. 
 
(v) Towards the end of 1975, the head of the plaintiffs` exploration division, one Soediono, came to Thahir`s home in Jakarta and proposed to him that he should invest DM30m out of his personal resources in a steel pipe manufactory which Mannesman AG proposed to build in Jakarta. 
 
(vi) It was at all material times usual and lawful for high-ranking officials of (inter alios) the plaintiffs and its subsidiaries to supplement their very small salaries by remittance deriving from (inter alios) the plaintiffs` contractors. Such officials include the said Soediono, the head of Pertamina shipping, one Sukotojo, the head of Pertamina domestic petroleum distribution, one Judo Sumbowo, and the Pertamina manager of the Dumai project, one Patiasina. Further the president director of Krakatau steel project from its revival by the Indonesian government until early 1976, one Marijuni, received commissions from contractors for the said project including Ferrostahl AG, who carried out works for about US$1.2 bn. 
 
(vii) and (viii) were deleted. 
 
(ix) The first defendant will aver that the size of Thahir`s additional income was not unusual for a person of his standing as to the amounts involved.
  
 
 
By a new para 10A in her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir asserts that Pertamina have no title to maintain the action. She grounds this contention on the basis that the contracts with Klockner and Siemens were entered into by or on behalf of PTKS and/or PT Krakatau Ferrosteel and the fact that payments were made to the two German contractors under those contracts to which Pertamina are strangers.
By para 11 of her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir admitted the salary paid to General Thahir by Pertamina, the ACU deposits, their currencies and dates of payment and the attempts to obtain the further sums. She, however, denies the rest of the allegations in para 9 of the statement of claim. She says in particular that General Sutowo was in charge of the contracts. By voluntary further particulars filed on 25 September 1991 she refers to para 9(ix) of the statement of claim and asserts that the Indonesian Bankruptcy Act contains provisions analogous to the Anglo-Saxon concept of `fraudulent preference` but such provisions have no application outside the context of bankruptcy.
The estate of General Thahir asserts that he had independent means and was possessed of substantial assets and property. He owned a house in Jakarta valued at Rupiahs 80m. He owned a piece of land in Palembang, Indonesia with an area of 9,850sq m. He also owned two houses and two pieces of land in that city which were valued at Rupiahs 7.5m each. By para 10 of its defence the estate of General Thahir says that at all material times General Thahir was entitled to carry on business on his own account. He was in business prior to his appointment in 1965 as general assistant to the then president director of Pertamina. In 1952 General Thahir became a director of a company which dealt in commodities such as rubber, coffee, etc. He also joined a shipping company. Mr Hunt mentions that the rate of exchange between 1972 and 1975 was 170 Rupiahs to the Singapore dollar, `just to give one some sort of feel of what the figures mean`.
By para 10 of the statement of claim Pertamina asserts that General Thahir was entrusted with intangible property, namely, the confidential information of Pertamina in relation to their intentions, abilities and powers regarding the contracts which General Thahir negotiated, concluded and implemented with Klockner and Siemens. They say that they are entitled to rely on General Thahir to deal with such property for their benefit and to procure for them the best possible terms. By agreeing to receive bribes, they say that General Thahir had caused them loss. Mrs Kartika Thahir by para 12 of her defence denies that General Thahir had played the roles which Pertamina allege in relation to the contracts. General Thahir had done no more than what Pertamina was obliged to do under the contracts with Klockner and Siemens.
Mrs Kartika Thahir adds an important set of further and better particulars under para 12 of her defence. By the said voluntary particulars filed on 25 September 1991, she reiterates the proposition that under Indonesian law the receipt of any commission is not per se unlawful. Her particulars go on to assert that the receipt of such commissions may, depending upon the terms of the employment contract, constitute a breach of such contract; but, notwithstanding any such terms, an employer may generally consent to the employee`s practices in performing his job including, inter alia, the employee`s receipt of commissions. Under Law No 8/1971, she says that the knowledge of the president director constitutes knowledge of Pertamina.
At this juncture, it is more appropriate in my view to deal with paras 11 and 12 of the statement of claim together and the defence of both Mrs Kartika and the estate of General Thahir before I come back to the amended para 11A of the statement of claim. By para 11 Pertamina, relying on the particulars set out in para 9 of the statement of claim, repeat their allegation that General Thahir had acted in breach of duty as described in their averments and contend that the ACU deposits (being the proceeds of moneys retained and/or bribes, rewards or commissions paid to or to the order of General Thahir 
 as their agent or mandatory 
 are in fact and in Indonesian law and/or Singapore law the property of Pertamina. By para 12 Pertamina claim that General Thahir was until his death 
 constructive trustee 
 and thereafter Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or the estate of General Thahir, became 
 constructive trustees 
 for Pertamina of the ACU deposits and by reason thereof or otherwise by operation of the law of Indonesia and/or of Singapore Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or the estate of General Thahir were bound to hold the same for Pertamina absolutely and/or to account therefor to Pertamina as money had and received to Pertamina`s use and/or Pertamina are entitled to trace the said moneys into any account or accounts in Mrs Kartika Thahir`s name.
By para 13 of her defence, Mrs Kartika Thahir denies para 11 of the statement of claim. She further denies that the ACU deposits are the property of Pertamina or that anyone other than General Thahir was the intended payee thereof. She also denies that General Thahir was trustee of his powers as Pertamina allege. Without prejudice to the generality of her denials and assertions, she contends that the concept of `mandatory` is unknown to Singapore law and that as a matter of Indonesian law, a `mandate` is a contract in which one person, the principal/mandator gives to another, the mandatory, a power to execute a juristic act in his name. She specifically denies that General Thahir was such a mandatory as alleged or at all. By her voluntary further and better particulars of September 1991, she advances three more propositions, viz (a) as a matter of Indonesian law, General Thahir did not act in breach of any fiduciary duty and, in so far as any ACU deposits were the proceeds of commissions, such moneys were not the `property` of Pertamina; (b) General Thahir was not a `trustee of his powers`, such concept being unknown in Indonesian law; and (c) General Thahir did not become a `trustee` of any of the said moneys; neither Mrs Kartika Thahir nor the estate of General Thahir became constructive trustee nor did they become bound to hold the said moneys for Pertamina or to account therefor to Pertamina as money had and received on the basis that such concepts are unknown in Indonesian law.
I now return to Pertamina`s amended para 14A which pleads squarely their position under Indonesian law. By taking bribes and/or secret commissions as alleged General Thahir was in breach of his contractual duties as their employee, was in violation of the statutory provisions pleaded in para 4A of the statement of claim and had committed a tort against Pertamina. Pertamina proceed to contend that they would have been entitled to recover from General Thahir and are entitled to recover from his estate the said ACU deposits by way of performance of General Thahir`s contractual duties and/or as the appropriate remedy for such breach of his contractual duties and/or tort and/or pursuant to the doctrine of unjust enrichment.
The defence of Mrs Kartika Thahir should be addressed in full. They are set out extensively in paras 13A-13L, which were amended on 23 December 1991 by order of this court. The estate of General Thahir adopts these defences. Paragraph 13A is a general denial. The rest of these paragraphs are in the following terms: 
 
 
(13) A Each and every allegation in para 11A of the reamended statement of claim is denied. 
 
(13) B Without prejudice 
 
(a) to the generality of the foregoing and 
 
(b) to the first defendant`s right to plead further to the allegations contained in that paragraph if and when the plaintiffs serve an answer to the first defendant`s request for further and better particulars the first defendant will contend as follows. 
 
(13) C The amendments to the statement of claim relate back to the original date of service of the statement of claim, viz 8 April 1981. In the premises, all causes of action which arose more than six years prior to that date, viz 8 April 1975 are time-barred and, for that reason, unmaintainable. On the plaintiffs` own case, all the plaintiffs` claim are based upon causes of action which arose prior to 8 April 1975 and, in the premises, are time-barred and unmaintainable. 
 
(13) D As to the allegations in para 11A(i)(a) and (c), the first defendant repeats paras 5, 10 and 12 above and the further particulars of Indonesian law already served on 
 
25 September 1991. 
 
(13) E As to the allegations contained in para 11A(i)(b), ie alleged violation of the alleged statutory provisions referred to in para 4A of the reamended statement of claim, 
 
(i) The High Court of Singapore has no jurisdiction to entertain an action or claim for the enforcement either directly or indirectly of a foreign penal or other public law and the remainder of this pleading is served without prejudice thereto. 
 
(ii) As a matter of Indonesian law, the plaintiffs in this action have no civil claim, whether propriety [sic] or otherwise, for any such alleged violation. 
 
(iii) In the alternative to (ii) above: 
 
(1) No prosecution or other action was commenced prior to General Thahir`s death and, as a matter of Indonesian law: 
 
(a) no such prosecution or action could thereafter be made; and 
 
(b) in the absence of any successful prosecution or action, no civil action based upon such alleged violations was or is now maintainable. 
 
(2) Further or alternatively, even if (which is denied) such civil claim does exist in Indonesian law, such claim is not maintainable in this court because, as a matter of Singapore conflict of laws, it does not satisfy the double-actionability rule. 
 
(13) F With regard to Law No 3/1971: 
 
As to s 1(a) of that law, it is specifically denied that General Thahir committed any act
  
 
 
 
(1) which was in contravention of the law as referred to in sub-para 1(a) of that law; 
 
(2) which directly or indirectly caused a loss to the state`s funds and economy; 
 
(3) which he knew or had reason to believe would cause a loss to the state`s funds and economy. 
 
(13) G With regard to Regulation No 2/1968: 
 
This purported regulation was revoked by Regulation No 2/1971 and is inapplicable. 
 
(13) H With regard to Regulation No 2/1971: 
 
(a) This Regulation was purportedly made on 17 May 1971 and by its terms applied to 
 certain 
 personnel only of PN Pertamina 
 not 
 the plaintiffs in this action and is inapplicable. 
 
(b) 
 Subsequently 
, the plaintiffs in this action were established by Law No 8/1971 which was enacted on 15 September 1971. Regulation No 2/1971 did not apply to the plaintiffs. 
 
(c) Article 33(1) of Law No 8/1971 provided that matters not yet sufficiently regulated in that law shall be 
 subsequently 
 provided by government regulation. Regulation No 2/1971 was 
 prior 
 to 
 not 
 subsequent to Law No 8/1971 and is, for that reason, inapplicable. 
 
(d) Further or alternatively, Regulation No 2/71 was superseded by Regulation No 2/72, alternatively Regulation No 3/72. 
 
(e) In any event, and without prejudice to any of the foregoing: 
 
(1) Regulation No 2/71 did not, by virtue of its own terms, have any application to any employee who was governed by a separate salary regulation. The plaintiffs` case is that General Thahir was governed by a separate salary regulation and, on that basis, it is specifically denied that he was an `employee` within the definition of that regulation. 
 
(2) By its express terms, the regulation is only applicable to 
 certain 
 employees as designated therein. The plaintiffs are put to strict proof that General Thahir was such an employee. 
 
(13) I With regard to Presidential Decree No 10: 
 
(1) By its terms, that decree only applies to certain officials as stipulated in Government Regulation No 6 Year 1974. General Thahir was not an `official` within the meaning of that regulation. 
 
(2) In any event, that decree was purportedly made on 5 March 1974. It was not retrospective and, in the premises, has no application to any moneys which may have been received by General Thahir, prior to that date. 
 
(3) By art 13 of that decree, the sanctions which were applicable to uphold its implementation were limited to those set out therein. They do not include any claim by the plaintiffs. 
 
(13) J As to the allegation in 11A(ii) 
 
(1) If (which is denied) the plaintiffs have any claim against the estate by reason of the matters stated therein, such claim is irrelevant as between the plaintiffs and the first defendant in the context of these interpleader proceedings within RSC O 17 and the amended issue herein. 
 
(2) Further or alternatively, even if (which is denied) the plaintiffs would have had any of the entitlements referred to in this sub-paragraph under Indonesian law, such would-be entitlements in any event provide no basis for any claim to the moneys in the ACU deposit accounts in the context of these interpleader proceedings within RSC O 17 and the amended issue herein. 
 
(3) In any event, the first defendant repeats the further particulars of Indonesian law served on 25 September 1991 and will further contend that as a matter of Indonesian law: 
 
(a) None of the alleged modes of entitlement give rise to any proprietary claim against the moneys in the ACU deposit accounts. 
 
(b) The plaintiffs had no entitlement to seek recovery `by way of performance` of any alleged contractual duties. 
 
(c) Such remedy as the plaintiffs may have had was a remedy in damages only subject to proof of: 
 
(i) actual loss suffered by the plaintiffs themselves; 
 
(ii) such loss was caused by a wrongful act; 
 
(iii) such loss was foreseeable. 
 
The plaintiffs are put to strict proof of each of the foregoing. 
 
(d) Alternatively, if ,which is denied, there was any contractual obligation of a kind referred to in para 3(vii) of the reamended statement of claim and if, which is further denied, the plaintiffs had any entitlement to performance of such obligation, such entitlement was limited to the moneys actually received and no more other than simple interest of 6%pa calculated on the actual amount of proven damages from the date of the commencement of any action by the plaintiffs. In particular, it is specifically denied that the plaintiffs had any entitlement to any interest actually earned thereon. 
 
(e) There is no doctrine of unjust enrichment at all or under which the plaintiffs could make a proprietary claim for any moneys received by Thahir or against the ACU deposits or under which the plaintiffs make a proprietary claim for specific performance or restitution in their favour. 
 
(13) K Further or alternatively, with regard to the non-Pertamina contracts, the first defendant will say that any payments that Pertamina may have made were, on the plaintiffs` own case, made as agent for and on behalf of the particular contracting Indonesian party. The first defendant will further contend:
  
 
 
 
(1) That, as a matter of Indonesian law, there is no presumption of loss and, in the absence of proof of loss actually suffered by reason of any breach of duties owed by General Thahir to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs cannot maintain any action. 
 
(2) That it is denied that the plaintiffs have suffered any actual loss by reason of any breach of duties owed by General Thahir to the plaintiffs. 
 
(3) That, even if (which is denied) any payments were originally made by the plaintiffs in such capacity, the plaintiffs were subsequently reimbursed in respect of all such payments as they may have made and, for that reason, have suffered no loss. 
 
(4) Further or alternatively, in the premises, the plaintiffs have not borne the expense of any of the alleged payments and, as a matter of Singapore law, the plaintiffs cannot maintain the present claim. 
 
(13) L In any event, the first defendant will contend: 
 
(1) that pursuant to Presidential Decree No 30/1975, the status of the contracts between the plaintiffs and the other contractors was changed into contracts between PT Krakatau Steel and the relevant contractors and the plaintiffs were thereafter fully reimbursed in respect of any such payments; and/or 
 
(2) that the plaintiffs entered into separate tripartite agreements with PT Krakatau Steel and, inter alia, Siemens and Klockner whereby it was agreed: 
 
(a) that all payments made by the plaintiffs under the relevant contract were deemed to have been made by PT Krakatau Steel and all work done by Siemens/Klockner under the relevant contract were deemed to have been done under a contract with PT Krakatau Steel; 
 
(c) that with regard to the stipulated contracts with the plaintiffs, such contracts were deemed to have been transferred to PT Krakatau Steel. 
 
(3) In the premises, the plaintiffs have suffered no loss and/or cannot maintain this action.
  
 
 
As to para 13C of the defence of Mrs Kartika Thahir, Pertamina by para 8 of their re-reamended reply say that if, which is not admitted, any of their causes of action arose prior to 8 April 1975, Pertamina will contend that General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir deliberately and in fraud of Pertamina concealed from them until at least the date of General Thahir`s death on 23 July 1976 the facts and matters pleaded in the statement of claim. Pertamina rely on the first sentence of para 8, first paragraph and (iv), (vi), (viii) (first sentence), (ix) (fifth and sixth sentences), (xi) of para 9 and (iv) (first two lines), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of para 15 of their statement of claim. Paragraph 15 of the statement of claim will be set out later in this judgment.
Pertamina in para 13 of the statement of claim deal with the capacity of the Sumitomo Bank. They say that the ACU deposits were paid to the bank as agent for Pertamina by or on behalf of General Thahir and he was liable to account therefor to Pertamina. After his death Mrs Kartika Thahir and/or his estate (if either had any lawful interest therein which is denied) became liable to account therefor to Pertamina and they contend that the said ACU deposits continue to be held by them on Pertamina`s behalf and not otherwise. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the alleged agency of the bank and her liability to account therefor to Pertamina.
By para 14 of the statement of claim Pertamina refer to Mrs Kartika Thahir`s allegation that the said ACU deposits were held from early 1974 in the joint names of General Thahir and herself but Pertamina deny the legality, propriety or enforceability of the purported transfer of the ACU deposits into joint names in Indonesian and/or Singapore law.
Pertamina in their claim proceed to deal with the position and complicity of Mrs Kartika. These are extensively alleged in paras 15 and 16 of the statement of claim and, in view of the crucial averments therein, they are accordingly reproduced below: 
 
 
(15) If and in so far as may be necessary, the plaintiffs will contend that Kartika had knowledge of and/or was privy to the facts and matters set out in para 9 hereof. The plaintiffs will rely upon the following facts and matters: 
 
(i) Kartika alleges that she was married to Thahir on 29 July 1984. 
 
(ii) Kartika had lived with Thahir as his mistress for a period of approximately five years prior to the said purported marriage. 
 
(iii) Kartika well knew of Thahir`s position with and duties to the plaintiffs and his income and wealth as set out in paras 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 hereof. 
 
(iv) Kartika was well aware of Thahir`s unlawful and improper arrangements with German contractors as aforesaid and was frequently present at meetings and discussions with the representatives of such contractors, namely: 
 
(a) In 1973, Thahir accompanied by Kartika and others attended a meeting in Western Germany with Martin Struchen of Martin Struchen GMBH in order to discuss the possible resolution of Pertamina`s financial crisis. 
 
(b) At Bonn in Western Germany at about the same time Thahir and Kartika attended a meeting with the financial director of Siemens. 
 
(c) In 1974 in Singapore Kartika attended a business meeting between Thahir and one Lohse (a representative of Klockner) who was well known to Kartika. The said meeting concerned the Krakatau steel project and the financial arrangements therefor. 
 
(v) Kartika knew and/or was privy to the fact that Thahir received the sums of money represented by the ACU deposit accounts. In or about August 1972 in Singapore Thahir and Kartika discussed with the chairman of Sumitomo the opening in Singapore of a joint deposit account with its Singapore branch. Both Thahir and Kartika emphasized that such deposits should be kept secret and that they should each have drawing rights. She also attended meetings in early 1974 in Japan between Thahir and one Hotta, the then chairman of Sumitomo. The subject of the said meetings was the opening of the said ACU deposit accounts and the disposition of the moneys represented thereby. 
 
(vi) In or about 1974, Kartika attended meetings in Singapore between Thahir and one Yamaura, the then branch manager of Sumitomo. The subject of the said meetings was the opening of the said ACU deposit accounts and the disposition of the sums of money represented thereby. 
 
(vii) After the said ACU deposit accounts were opened Kartika kept herself fully informed of the state thereof and of the sums of moneys represented thereby. The plaintiffs will rely on admissions in affidavits sworn by Kartika on 
 
2 March 1977 and 31 January and/or 1 February 1980. 
 
(viii) In 1976, Thahir and Kartika planned to use some of the said moneys to purchase or attempt to purchase the Hyatt Hotel, Singapore. 
 
(ix) By reason of her knowledge of the wrongdoing of Thahir to which she was party Kartika improperly attempted to prevent any adverse claims being made in respect of the said ACU deposits by proceeding to Singapore promptly on the death of Thahir in an endeavour to withdraw funds held at, inter alia, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chase Manhattan NV and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. She immediately withdrew the funds held at Hongkong and Shanghai and Chase Manhattan (further particulars whereof cannot be given until after discovery) but she failed to persuade Sumitomo to pay to her the amounts represented by the ACU deposits, the subject of this claim. 
 
(x) At about the end of 1976 or the beginning of 1977, Kartika requested one Raharjo Sudjie in Jakarta to contact Ibrahim Thahir, another son of the deceased, to ask him to travel to Singapore in order to discuss, inter alia, ways and means of persuading the German contractors to pay moneys allegedly due from them to Thahir. 
 
(xi) Kartika admitted to Sudjie that the reason why Thahir remained with the plaintiffs during 1976 despite the fact that all his colleagues had retired was that Thahir was still expecting payment of the balance of commissions from the German contractors. 
 
(xii) Consequent upon such meeting and with a view to pursuing her illegal claims, Kartika on or about 29 August 1977 obtained a power of attorney from Ibrahim Thahir acting on behalf of himself and the estate to enable her to seek to recover moneys allegedly owed to Thahir by Siemens International Department, Munich, West Germany. 
 
(xiii) By an agreement in writing dated 29 August 1977 and made in Basel, Switzerland, Kartika and Ibrahim Thahir acting as aforesaid agree that - `all claims against Siemens roughly in the amount of DM15m were to be divided between the parties`. 
 
(xiv) The plaintiffs will further rely upon an oral admission made by Kartika to General Moerdani on or about 20 September 1977 in Switzerland to the effect that the money in the Sumitomo Bank came from the contractors in the Krakatau steel project and that Siemens was the source of DM15m and Klockner was the source of DM35m. 
 
(16) In the premises, Kartika was and has at all material times been a party to the wrongdoing of Thahir and has held the said sum jointly with him and/or in her own name for and on account of and/or in trust for the plaintiffs and not otherwise. Further by her attempts to obtain the said moneys for her own use from the date the same were jointly transferred into her name jointly with Thahir she was guilty of seeking to make effective and to perpetuate the frauds upon the plaintiffs to which she was privy. Further or alternatively she knowingly participated in and/or assisted Thahir in this dishonest and fraudulent design in breach of his duties and/or fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs hereinbefore described.
  
 
 
Mrs Kartika Thahir`s assertions in defence are equally crucial in importance and paras 16 and 17 of her defence, which are adopted by the estate of General Thahir, are set out below in seriatim. 
 
 
(16) (i) The first defendant admits and avers that the ACU deposits were held from early 1974 in the joint names of Thahir and herself, that she lived with Thahir for approximately five years prior to her marriage to him, that she married him on 
 
29 July 1974 and that as his close companion and wife she had general, although not detailed, knowledge of his business and financial affairs. 
 
(ii) Save that the first defendant habitually travelled with Thahir and attended (but in a social capacity only) the meeting referred to in para 15(iv)(a) of the reamended statement of claim, sub-para (iv) thereof is denied. It is denied that the first defendant was aware of unlawful arrangements of Thahir with German contractors (which are denied). The first defendant avers that officials and local representatives of the plaintiffs were present at all discussions between Thahir and foreign contractors and bankers. In particular, Dr Sanger was present at meetings in Switzerland, Mr Karinda was present at other European meetings, Mr Hasmoro at meetings in the United States of America and Mr Nur Usman at meetings concerning financial arrangements including proposed loans to the plaintiffs. 
 
(iii) Paragraph 15(v), (vi) and (vii) of the reamended statement of claim is admitted. 
 
(iv) After the death of Thahir, the first defendant unsuccessfully endeavoured to withdraw four of the said ACU deposits which had matured by 26 July 1976. Further, as she was entitled to do, she withdrew funds belonging to her from the Chase Manhattan Bank NV. Save as aforesaid, para 15(ix) of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that the first defendant effected, or attempted to effect, such withdrawals for the alleged or any improper motives. After the death of her husband she decided to make her home in Europe and to rearrange her affairs accordingly. 
 
(v) Save that it is denied that the first defendant acted illegally or improperly, 
 
para 15(x), (xii) and (xiii) of the reamended statement of claim is admitted. Sub-para (xi) and (xiv) thereof are denied. 
 
(17) Paragraph 16 of the reamended statement of claim is denied. It is denied that the first defendant was a party to the alleged or any wrongdoing of Thahir (which is denied) or that she knowingly participated in or assisted Thahir in the alleged or any dishonest and fraudulent design (which is denied) or that her attempts to obtain the said moneys for her own use were anything other than attempts to enforce her legal rights.
  
 
 
We now come to the new para 16A of the statement of claim which separately sets out Pertamina`s case against both the defendants under Indonesian law. Pertamina contend that they are entitled to the ACU deposits from Mrs Kartika Thahir as the appropriate remedy for her tort as an accomplice of Thahir in his tort against them. As against her, Pertamina rely on the facts and matters set out in para 15 of their statement of claim. In addition or in the alternative Pertamina say that they are also entitled to the ACU deposits pursuant to the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies these contentions and repeat paras 13A-13L of her defence.
Pertamina then allege by para 17 of the statement of claim conspiracy by General Thahir, Mrs Kartika Thahir and others unknown to defraud Pertamina by arranging for the moneys in the ACU deposits, which should have remained with Pertamina, to be channelled to General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir. They therefore claim that the ACU deposits are their moneys. Mrs Kartika Thahir denies the alleged conspiracy to defraud and specifically denies that the said moneys were or should have remained with Pertamina. The estate pleads a general denial.
In para 18 of the statement of claim, Pertamina refer to the attempts of
Mrs Kartika Thahir and Ibrahim Thahir, who acted on behalf of the estate, to obtain payment of DM15m from Siemens. They claim that in doing so they, and others unknown, conspired to defraud Pertamina of what was the property of Pertamina. Mrs Kartika alleges that she was entitled to obtain payment of the remaining sums due to General Thahir but otherwise denies any conspiracy to defraud or that the sums were in any sense the property of Pertamina. Again, the estate pleads a general denial.
Finally and by para 19, Pertamina plead that in any event it would be contrary to the comity of friendly states and contrary to international public policy as well as to the domestic public policy of both Indonesia and Singapore to cause or allow or permit the proceeds of crime or breach of duty to be paid to or used to the advantage of the wrongdoer, his family, heirs, or successors or anyone else who was a party or privy to his wrongdoing. On the contrary, Pertamina plead that the sums in issue or their proceeds should be directed to be paid to the victim of the wrongdoing, namely, Pertamina. Both Mrs Kartika Thahir and the estate generally deny this paragraph.
The following are the reliefs which Pertamina claim: 
 
 
(i) A declaration that all the moneys represented by the ACU deposit accounts in Sumitomo in the name of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir belong to the plaintiffs absolutely. 
 
(ii) Alternatively a declaration that the said ACU deposit accounts at Sumitomo in the name of HA Thahir and/or Kartika Ratna Thahir are held subject to a trust in favour of the plaintiffs and not otherwise. 
 
(iii) Alternatively a declaration that the plaintiffs are absolutely entitled to the ACU deposit accounts at Sumitomo or the proceeds thereof as being moneys had and received to the plaintiffs` use. 
 
(iv) A declaration that the said moneys being the proceeds of crime or otherwise obtained unlawfully and/or in breach of duty by the said Thahir should not be disposed of otherwise than to the plaintiffs. 
 
(v) Alternatively a declaration that Kartika Ratna Thahir, having assisted Thahir in his dishonest and fraudulent design and/or having participated therein is in any event liable to the plaintiffs as a constructive trustee of the sums standing to the credit of the said ACU deposit accounts. 
 
(vi) An order that the said ACU deposits or the proceeds thereof be paid out to the order of the plaintiffs and Sumitomo Bank Ltd be thereupon and not otherwise discharged from all further liability to any person in respect thereof. 
 The material facts 
 (a) Pertamina
  
 
 
On 20 August 1968 `PN Pertamina` was incorporated by Law No 44 of 1968. It was a statutory fusion of two existing companies, viz Permina and Pertamina which were engaged in the oil and oil-related industries. On 15 September 1971 Pertamina, the present plaintiffs, were created by Law No 8 of 1971. Since 1968 and at all material times the predecessors of and later Pertamina themselves became the single largest and most powerful industrial concern and through them a number of state undertakings were undertaken, funded and completed. Pertamina had the necessary financial resources, but the evidence indicated that the quality of management and control was far from being satisfactory. One such undertaking was the gigantic development of the Cilegon industrial complex for steel-making and related industries, which encompassed the redevelopment of the steel-making plant in Cilegon, northwest of Java, Indonesia. That steel plant was started initially with Russian assistance. But work on it was discontinued following the attempted coup d`etat in Indonesia.
In 1970 the government of Indonesia, anticipating that its national demand would be about 3.5m tons of crude steel by 1982, decided to revive the Cilegon steel plant and develop a national iron and steel industrial complex over a site of about 2,300ha for the complex and allied industries. On 31 August 1970 PTKS was incorporated by Law No 35 of 1970 and its task was to build the infrastructure, comprising the harbour, water and power supply and a railway line to connect the harbour to the steel mill. PTKS was also responsible for the development of the steel plant. The development plan had three phases, viz (1) from 1973 to 1976 to complete the former Cilegon project, and install a metallurgical plant for the production of billets, cold rolling mills, a continuous wire rod mill and a pipe-making plant; (2) secondly, from 1976 to 1979 to install bar mills and a hot strip mill; and (3) from 1979 to 1982 to extend some of the metallurgical mills.
Pertamina was financially responsible for and, as will be elaborated later, they paid for the infrastructure facilities. In many cases, they contracted for the building of the infrastructure facilities. These facilities may be broadly described as follows: (1) a new power generation equipment which was required to provide the vast quantity of electricity required for the new electric arc furnaces to produce the steel; (2) an improved water supply system to provide sufficient water for the steel mills and the allied industries; and (3) a new harbour and a new railway link for the import of the raw materials required for the steel-making process and for the export of the finished products. As will be seen later, it was Siemens which contracted to provide the power generation equipment and Klockner and its related companies which contracted to build and supply the water supply system, the railway and the harbour.
So far as Pertamina`s implementation of the infrastructure is concerned,
Mr Toerki Witoelar, a mechanical engineer, gave the following evidence. He said that the preparation, planning and construction of the steel mill proper were handled by a team of engineers from within PTKS. He was appointed project officer in June/July 1973 and was a member of the team of officers from Pertamina responsible for the construction of the infrastructure facilities. He testified that in fact and in practice Pertamina as from about June 1973 took over effective management and control of the construction of the infrastructure facilities in Cilegon. Pertamina`s officers formed the team. He was appointed the head of engineering and operations of the complex. In fact, he was the site superintendent. However, the position was only formalized by the board of directors of Pertamina by a resolution dated 28 November 1974 by which the Pertamina Infrastructure Division was formally created. General Sutowo was the head of the division. He was supposed to report to General Sutowo and General Thahir. In practice, he could not see General Sutowo as General Sutowo was very busy. Often, he was diverted to and reported to General Thahir who was formally appointed by General Sutowo only on 3 January 1975 as `executive in charge of daily affairs of Cilegon Infrastructures Division`. Toerki Witoelar said that he had meetings with Klockner`s personnel in late 1973. He was at Pertamina`s office on one occasion and he saw a group of Germans. General Thahir instructed him to negotiate with them. Pertamina was represented by Mr Matarlogawa, Mr Nasution, Pertamina`s legal adviser, and Mr Arrifin Boor who was an engineer from PTKS. Toerki Witoelar said the meetings lasted some three or four days and he saw his tasks as ensuring that the technical aspects of the contracts with Klockner were in order. He said he was instructed by General Thahir, as if on the spur of the moment, to join his colleagues in the negotiations because he happened to be in the office. He was not briefed in advance; nor was he given any technical documents before the meetings. It was during the meetings that the Klockner personnel provided the technical documents. The meetings with Klockner over three or four days did not discuss the question of pricing at all.
Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa, a Pertamina employee who was seconded to PT Petrajasa and who had worked in the head office of Pertamina from 1978 until his retirement in 1982, gave evidence on the initial history of Permina and later the structural organization of Pertamina, and on his role in the Krakatau steel project. Like Mr Toerki Witoelar, he also identified many of Pertamina`s documents and contracts which were produced in court. He had a vast experience in assisting management in the petroleum business. He had worked for PT Shell Indonesia, which was acquired and taken over by Permina. After Pertamina`s takeover, he worked in PT Petrajasa, a subsidiary of Pertamina. He was responsible to provide housing and to meet the needs of expatriates who worked for Pertamina`s foreign contractors. His immediate superior was General Thahir. His relationship with General Thahir was not comfortable. He said that General Sutowo, as head of Permina, in the early days had recruited rather inexperienced engineers to head various divisions. At the initial stage, there were three oil companies in Indonesia. In 1962/3 Indonesia produced about 400-450 thousand barrels of oil per day. After the coup d`etat, the three companies were merged into Pertamina. Over the next ten years, Pertamina successfully achieved oil production at 11U2m barrels a day. He said Pertamina`s administrative capacity was very wanting. The management was very loose and there was no job description, no clear lines of authority and no delegation of financial authority. This situation continued, despite the attempts in 1974/5 to maintain some sort of internal audit and produce a budget. There were still signs of poor management up to 1980. He said that this situation lent itself to abuse by officers who did not work for the best interest of Pertamina. For instance, he said that General Thahir, being an ambitious and dominant personality, could and did exercise the power and authority of other officers. He cited one instance when General Thahir used the name of General Sutowo and ordered the purchase of six houses by Pertamina in order to provide parking space for the Oil Centre building which Pertamina built in Jakarta.
Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa told this court how General Sutowo worked. He would only deal with specific matters of Pertamina through certain designated officers. For instance, in matters of supply of materials to Pertamina, the `best bet` was to go through General Thahir. One had to go through General Thahir before one could get a contract. However, he did not think that General Thahir could influence General Sutowo, as General Thahir would like others to think. He said General Sutowo was a very good entrepreneur but his weakness was his lack of management skills.
He then described his role in relation to Pertamina`s negotiations with Klockner for the Krakatau steel project. General Thahir instructed him, on one day`s notice, to join Pertamina`s team as mentioned by Mr Toerki Witoelar to negotiate with Klockner in respect of the harbour, the railway link and the water supply link to the steel mill. General Thahir told him to complete the negotiations with despatch as the Germans wanted to return home. They were to negotiate on the technical aspects of the contracts and not the financial or pricing issues. He thought he was chosen, not for his technical expertise, but because of his experience of having worked for PT Shell Indonesia and for the reasons that he could communicate with Klockner in English and that he could get along with foreigners. He was not aware that Pertamina had called for any tender. He expressed the view that for such a substantial project, PT Shell Indonesia would have called for tenders. Pertamina`s team had no documents, technical or otherwise, and they used those provided by Klockner. Klockner were represented by 11 or 12 Germans. He remembered that they discussed the technical drawings. The negotiations took three to four days. But he remembered that the master list containing all the technical items, which were necessary for the import permit, were left to be finalized between the Germans and Mr Toerki Witoelar. After those negotiations, Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa himself was not involved in the project proper at all except for initialling the relevant contracts which he identified. As leader of the team he initialled to confirm Pertamina`s agreement.
On 29 March 1973 Pertamina entered into a contract with Siemens who agreed to supply one diesel power station of four sets each 9,500KVA complete with all necessary equipment at the contract price of DM34.85m fob European seaport. It was intended for PTKS. Copies of the provisions of the agreement are in exh E3/140-195. By an agreement dated 16 August 1973 between Pertamina and Siemens, Siemens agreed to supply to PTKS one complete steam power station 240MW, complete with all necessary equipment and including erection works. The total price of the contract material and services was DM394,822,400. Copies of the provisions of this agreement are in exh E3/196-310. I should interpose to note the fact that Matches 4, 5, 6 and 8, which were set out in Annexure B in the statement of claim were proved on the evidence to relate to this agreement of 16 August 1973 entered into between Pertamina and Siemens.
By another agreement dated 4 May 1974 between PTKS and Siemens, the parties agreed to sell and purchase an extension of the power generation and power distribution plant. Siemens agreed to supply one complete steam power station of 160MW together with the necessary equipment and to render the services as specified in Annex A to that contract. The total contract price for the material and services was DM573,703,700. Copies of this agreement are set out in exh E3/311-430. I should also interpose to note the fact that Matches 7, 9 and 10, which were set out in Annexure B in the statement of claim, were proved on the evidence to relate to this agreement entered into between PTKS and Siemens.
By a contract dated 23 January 1974 between Pertamina and Klockner, Klockner agreed to supply to Pertamina (1) the plant, equipment, machinery and equipment required for the harbour at Cilegon, Indonesia, having a capacity for berthing 50,000ton deadweight bulk carriers; (2) the handling and conveying facilities on the pier and on shore; (3) the railway line for connecting the harbour with an existing railway line; and (4) for the water supply facilities. The contract prices were:(a) for the harbour and the handling plant on the pier and on shore, the sum of DM106,805,300; (b) for the railway line, the sum of DM60,437,200; and (c) for the water supply facilities, the sum of DM301.99m. The total contract sum was DM469,232,500. The evidence satisfied me that this contract was backdated to 23 January 1974. Copies of the contract are set out in exh E3/17-44. I was also satisfied on the evidence that Matches 1, 2 and 3, which were set out in Annexure B of the statement of claim, related to this contract.
The engineering and civil works which related to Klockner`s three enormous constituents of the infrastructure were entrusted by Pertamina under an agreement also dated 23 January 1974 to a joint venture between Ed Zublin AG and Grun & Bilfinger AG. The total contract sum was DM92,678,565 and for present purposes the joint venture may be regarded as having operated under the umbrella of Klockner.
On 14 May 1974 PTKS entered into a contract with Siemens for the supervision, erection and commissioning of the power station which was covered by one of the Pertamina contracts with Siemens.
Klockner and Siemens under their contracts with Pertamina and PTKS from time to time supplied the materials and rendered the services. In early 1975, however, Pertamina encountered a serious financial crisis. The government of Indonesia decided that Pertamina should no longer have carriage of the development of the Krakatau steel project and the industrial complex in Cilegon. General Sutowo ceased to be the president director of Pertamina. By Presidential Decree No 13 of 1975 dated 17 April 1975, Dr JB Sumarlin, the Minister of Order and Perfecting of State Apparatuses and Vice Chairman of Bappenas, was directed by the President of Indonesia to review the Krakatau steel project and renegotiate with the contractors, including Klockner and Siemens. Siemens renegotiated their contracts and all their contracts were substituted by the renegotiated contract dated 21 January 1976. Klockner renegotiated with PTKS directly and that renegotiated contract was dated 23 January 1976.
I should briefly deal with the question of accounting between Pertamina and the government of Indonesia in relation to what Pertamina had expended on the Krakatau steel project and the infrastructure in Cilegon, Indonesia. As between them, it was established as common ground in these proceedings that some US$585m was incurred by Pertamina and that sum was set off against the liabilities which Pertamina were owing the government of Indonesia. (b) General Thahir
General Thahir was born on 12 November 1912 in Palembang, Indonesia. He went through elementary and junior high school after which he completed the Intermediate Commercial Education in Palembang. He joined the army in 1945. By 1949 he became a Colonel and was the Chief of Staff of Finance of the Sumatra Command in Bukit Tinggi. He retired from the Indonesian Armed Forces, having risen to the rank of Brigadier-General. From 1950 he retired from the army at his own request and engaged in several businesses , including import and export. General Thahir was very close to General Sutowo because they had fought alongside each other against the Dutch colonial government. According to his own curricular vitae dated December 1969, he became the adviser of the president director of Permina, which was the forerunner of Pertamina, General Sutowo in 1966. In fact, he was appointed as the assistant to the board of Permina which were his employers. In the following year, he was appointed as the personal assistant of the president director. By that appointment, he obviously worked closely and directly under General Sutowo. In March 1968 General Thahir was appointed as caretaker Director of Finance and Accounting of Permina. He had obviously considerable control and authority over matters of finance and accounting within Permina. Five months later, Pertamina was incorporated as noted earlier. It became at all material times the single largest industrial concern in Indonesia. General Sutowo as its president director wielded immense power and influence.
On 14 October 1968 General Thahir was appointed as general assistant to the president director. He headed the list of other appointees who were themselves heads of various substantial divisions within Pertamina, such as foreign marketing, tankers and the co-ordinating division for foreign contractors. In the following month and during the absence of the president director, General Thahir was authorized to sign all letters of transfer and all letters on behalf of Pertamina. For those working within Pertamina and to those dealing with Pertamina, it was made known through Pertamina`s News of July 1969, for example, that General Thahir was empowered and entrusted with the duties `to assist in ensuring the smooth performance of the daily duties in meeting the requirements in the purchase of materials and working equipment within and without the country` and `to assist in ensuring the smooth performance of the duties in protecting the assets, activities and officials of [Pertamina]`. These duties of General Thahir undoubtedly encompassed the infrastructure facilities which were eventually constructed for the Cilegon industrial complex. As an example of General Thahir`s position and power, he was also appointed as the executive commissioner of PT Pelita Air Service which took care of Pertamina`s needs for transportation by air. On 17 October 1970 General Thahir was instructed in writing to assist General Sutowo in performing purchasing control under the standing operation procedure. In other words, it was his responsibility to ensure purchases of the right quantity and quality at competitive prices and their timely delivery within the budget. On 21 January 1971 General Thahir issued the internal directive, undoubtedly I infer with the approval of General Sutowo, that all purchase orders of Pertamina had to be approved and initialled by him personally before they were submitted to General Sutowo for his approval and signature. A year later, General Thahir was, in addition to his other duties, placed at the disposal of the Director of Administration and Finance. Four months later, he was authorized to sign cash vouchers and cash demands for all contracts which had been signed by the president director. It would not be difficult to see how he could by virtue of this position ensure payment to or withhold payment from any contractor if he was inclined to. According to Mr Ibrahim Martalogawa, he overheard General Thahir giving instructions to Mr Nur Usman of the Finance Department to pay a certain gentleman by saying that it was the instruction of General Sutowo. On 3 January 1975 General Thahir was appointed by the board of directors of Pertamina to be the executive manager of the Cilegon Infrastructure Division of Pertamina. Again documenting the appointment followed long after the fact of the appointment.
In addition to proving Pertamina`s documents regarding their payments to Klockner and Siemens, Mr Nur Usman, who was treasurer in the Foreign Currency Department of Pertamina since 1972, said in evidence that he reported to his immediate superior, Mr Anondo, and also to General Thahir. Mr Anondo is very advanced in age and was unable to come to Singapore to give evidence. He said in evidence that after every payment to Klockner and Siemens, he would verbally report to General Thahir. He did so because General Thahir was responsible for the Krakatau steel project. In cross-examination, he confirmed that General Thahir as the general assistant of the president director wielded great influence not only in respect of the Krakatau steel project but in other Pertamina`s projects such as the Convention Hall project in Jakarta and many others where equipment was bought from abroad. He also revealed that General Thahir had ordered him to pay Klockner and Siemens when the instalments fell due. If the cash flow did not permit, he would as he did pay the sums due by a number of instalment payments. Mr Nur Usman also said in evidence that Klockner and Siemens had procured their contracts with Pertamina and PTKS through the influence of General Thahir. He confirmed that he had, for example, met the team from Siemens in the office of General Thahir. He also said that General Thahir had numerous discussions with officers of Pertamina in relation to the Krakatau steel project.
I was quite satisfied on the evidence that the duties of General Thahir were during the corresponding period far more responsible and extensive than many top chief executive directors or officers of many of the top companies in the corporate world. Most of all, it cannot be over-emphasized that the Cilegon industrial complex, including the Krakatau steel project, was a government project which was undertaken for the public common good of Indonesia.
At this juncture, it would be convenient to refer to the proceedings which Mrs Kartika Thahir commenced in 1977 against Sumitomo Bank Ltd in Japan to recover the ACU deposits. The narrative which follows is a summary of what Mrs Kartika Thahir herself had asserted in those proceedings. She claimed that General Thahir was in his lifetime an `important person in the financial and political circle` in Indonesia. She revealed that around August 1972 General Thahir had an important meeting in Singapore with Mr Shozo Hotta, the chairman of the bank. She said that the bank repeatedly entreated her and her husband to open a joint account in the bank because General Thahir `owned an enormous fortune`. In the absence of any evidence from Mrs Kartika Thahir, the inference must be that it was the couple that had in August 1972 informed Mr Shozo Hotta that General Thahir was enormously rich. Secondly, the analysis of the pleadings filed in this case does not disclose any assertion, and therefore no evidence whatsoever was led by Mrs Kartika Thahir, to prove that in August 1972 General Thahir and/or Mrs Kartika Thahir had already owned any fortune of the magnitude approaching the size of the ACU deposits which were later placed with the Singapore branch of the bank, beginning from May 1973, the following year. Since General Thahir had worked for a considerable period of time and had been in business, I do accept that the couple had amassed some fortune. But I am far from persuaded that by August 1972 or by May 1973 the couple had owned more than a fraction of the total ACU deposits. I am further ineluctably driven to infer that by August 1972, and certainly before the first ACU deposit was made in May 1973, General Thahir to the knowledge of Mrs Kartika Thahir had every reason to believe and entertained the expectation that General Thahir would be receiving substantial sums of money. Mrs Kartika Thahir elected to stay away from the witness box and has not explained to this court any legitimate source of the ACU deposits which were eventually placed with the bank in Singapore.
She further alleged that around May 1974 she and General Thahir met
Mr Shozo Hotta again. The meeting was in Tokyo. An agreement was reached to open the joint account. She alleged that it was agreed: (1) that secrecy of the depositors and security of the deposits shall be maintained in the same way as in Switzerland; (2) that either of the couple may at any time withdraw any deposit without the consent of the other; and (3) that the survivor of the couple may freely withdraw the balance of the deposits. Mrs Kartika Thahir explained in the Japanese proceedings that both of them had stressed the right of withdrawal by the survivor because the couple was legally married only on 29 July 1974, although they had lived as man and wife for five years before that date. She was anxious, as she admitted, to pre-empt any argument about the right to inheritance, seeing that the joint account was already opened, as she then claimed, on 10 June 1974. I am accordingly driven to the conclusion that Mrs Kartika Thahir knew that General Thahir was soon to come into a huge fortune and she was actively taking steps to ensure that she would obtain a good part, if not the whole, of it. I also cannot help but agree with Mr Hunt in his observation that often, though not always, secrecy is the badge of fraud.
The version from the bank came from the affidavit of Mr Akira Fujimine who was their general manager of the Singapore branch from 30 April 1975 to 31 October 1977. The bank denied that the deposit accounts were established as a consequence of the meeting with Mr Hotta and they further denied that it was at Mr Hotta`s suggestion that the couple decided to open the ACU account. The August 1972 meeting with Mr Hotta was not denied; only the effect of that meeting was in dispute. The bank`s deponent went on to say that he had been informed by Mr Yamaura, who was at all material times the general manager of the Singapore branch, that it was sometime in 1973, after Mr Yamaura had come to know General Thahir through business negotiations, that General Thahir informed Mr Yamaura that he, General Thahir, had some considerable amount of deposits with some other banks and that he could transfer them to the Singapore branch of the bank. I have to observe at this stage that this court has not seen evidence from Mrs Kartika Thahir that the sources of the ACU deposits in question in truth and in fact had emanated from any of General Thahir`s pre-existing deposits with some other banks. This inevitably raises the question why General Thahir had proffered that self-serving representation, the truth of which has been unsupported by any evidence at all.
It was in evidence that the first deposit in the series was made on 25 May 1973, and that thereafter before the end of May 1974, ten other deposits were made in the name of General Thahir. According to the bank`s deponent, and this was not disputed, the following transactions took place. In the beginning of June 1974 General Thahir visited the Singapore branch and opened a joint fixed deposit account in the names of General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir. It was for the sum of DM2,273,478.46 which was accepted by the Singapore branch on 10 June 1974. By the end of 1975 the Singapore branch had in total 19 deposits, all of which with the exception of one was in the sole name of General Thahir. Sometime in the latter part of 1975 after Mr Fujimine had become the general manager, General Thahir visited him, accompanied by Mrs Kartika Thahir. At this visit, General Thahir requested the bank to transfer all the deposits in his sole name to a joint fixed deposit account in the names of General Thahir and Mrs Kartika Thahir. On the written instructions of General Thahir, which Mr Fujimine required, the transfer of the fixed deposits into the joint account was effected by the bank after 19 January 1976.
(c) Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions
General Moerdani, Minister of Defence and Security of the Republic of Indonesia gave the following evidence. In May 1977 he was instructed by the President of Indonesia to recover what was believed to be bribes taken by General Thahir. He established contact with Mrs Kartika Thahir after writing to her. He had six meetings with her in Geneva, Switzerland, as she was not prepared to meet him in Jakarta, Indonesia. They first met in July 1977 in the office of a Swiss lawyer. A number of people attended that meeting. It was held on a `without prejudice` basis. Following that meeting, General Moerdani wrote to Mrs Kartika Thahir suggesting that they meet. He also suggested that he did not wish to have other parties not directly concerned with the matter being present at the meeting `in order to best conclude this matter`. Mrs Kartika Thahir replied and suggested that they meet around 17 or 18 September 1977. They met in his hotel room in the Inter-Continental Hotel, Geneva, Switzerland. General Moerdani was accompanied by Mr Ibrahim Thahir and Mr Mawati, a Notary of Indonesia and a personal friend of Mrs Kartika Thahir. Her daughter, Ms Faridah Thahir, accompanied her. Mrs Kartika Thahir gave General Moerdani the impression that she regarded him as a reasonable person who could help solve the problem. After a while, General Moerdani and Mrs Kartika Thahir were left alone in the room; the others went to the coffee house of the hotel. In the room, Mrs Kartika Thahir mentioned that Mr Ibrahim Thahir was very greedy, that the money belonged to her and that they should meet again, but only the two of them. General Moerdani agreed to the proposal. At this meeting, Mrs Kartika Thahir did not mention anything about the source of the money in Sumitomo Bank.
They met the following day. At first, Ms Faridah Thahir was present. It took place in the coffee house of Hotel Le Resident, just outside Geneva. After a while, Ms Faridah Thahir left them and went for a walk in the garden. General Moerdani testified that Mrs Kartika Thahir then told him a number of things, most of which were new to him. First, she told him that the money at the Singapore branch of Sumitomo Bank came from the Krakatau steel project, which General Moerdani said was a government project managed and funded by Pertamina. She further told him that the account at the bank was `some sort of a collecting point` of moneys that had been paid by Pertamina to the principal contractors who were Siemens and Klockner. She specifically mentioned that DM15m came from Siemens and DM35m came from Klockner and that payments were made every time Pertamina made a payment to its contractors and that it amounted to 21% at that particular time. Mrs Kartika Thahir also told General Moerdani that this account would further be split into three equal parts. One would go, according to Mrs Kartika Thahir, to General Sutowo, another one to Mr Junus Rani and the third to General Thahir. She further disclosed to General Moerdani that there were two other accounts at the Singapore branches of Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank but the amounts were relatively small. She said the accounts were `to cover daily spending money`. It amounted to US$1.2m. Mrs Kartika Thahir further disclosed that `50-something million Deutschmarks` in Singapore was only one third or one half of all the moneys that should be paid into the account of General Thahir and that one third, meaning another sum of DM50m, was already in a bank in Munich, Germany, but this sum was not transferred to General Thahir`s account in Singapore because General Thahir passed away.
Mrs Kartika Thahir also revealed to General Moerdani that her contacts in PT Krakatau Steel was a certain 
 Mr Haller and a Mr Mazur 
 . However, she did not tell him which organizations those two particular individuals were with.
General Moerdani said in evidence that before that meeting he did not know that the source of the money was the PT Krakatau steel project. All he knew was that the money amounted to about DM50m and US$1.2m in another bank or in two other banks; nor did he know that the principal contractors were Siemens and Klockner. He also had not heard of the names of 
 Haller 
 or 
 Mazur 
 . They were employees of the German contractors stationed in Jakarta.
General Moerdani also told this court that before her disclosures, he had offered Mrs Kartika Thahir two options. One was that she surrendered the whole amount to the Indonesian government and she would receive an amount or reward or a bonus at the discretion of the Indonesian government. The second was that she surrendered the whole amount at Sumitomo Bank to the Indonesian government and she would get the interest, starting from the day the money was deposited until 1 January 1977 or the first day of the following year, depending on how long the case would take. She rejected both. General Moerdani even offered to escort her and her children to Indonesia so that she could return the money personally to the government. She counter-proposed that she should get the money in Singapore and that she would escort him to Munich and introduce him to the right people at Munich who would be able to give him the DM50m that she mentioned before. He turned this down.
General Moerdani then produced two original documents to the court, copies of which are in exhs E8/77 and 78. Both of them had used those pieces of paper while they were talking at the coffee house at Le Hotel Resident. Turning to exh E8/78 General Moerdani said he wrote the first column, which was headed by `I` in a circle, except for the circle around the words `JA` and two curving strokes which, he thought, were made by Mrs Kartika Thahir. He also wrote on the second column headed by `II` and the third column headed by `III` written within a smaller circle and the word `Jakarta`. He said that she wrote the bigger circle and the cross over his writings in the third column. Towards the bottom of the page and just under the second column, Mrs Kartika Thahir wrote the words `Hallal T` and `Mazur` with a letter to the right. She also wrote the diagram on the right.
General Moerdani then explained that the first column represented his first option which he offered. Having examined the original, General Moerdani told the court that what was written and later deleted appeared to be the figure 53,000 or 50,000. He said he had written either of the two figures; he could not say who had written the deletion. He said that the figure meant million and not thousand and that it referred to the 50 million in Sumitomo Bank. He said that the writing `S-K-M` meant Siemens and Klockner. As for `M`, it could be 
 Mazur 
 but he mentioned that he was only guessing. He indicated that the truth was that he could not remember. As for the words `JA`, he said it was the joint account in the bank and the circle and the two curving strokes recorded her indication that it was a collecting point for moneys that were put in by the two contractors.
Turning to the second column, General Moerdani told the court that the figure `50,000` signified the total of the money which Klockner and Siemens had put in the bank. It meant 50 million. The words `S:15` and `K:35` referred to the amounts put in by Siemens and Klockner. He got the figures from Mrs Kartika Thahir. He could not recall the signification of the word `Yusuf` below those entries. As for the circle and cross which Mrs Kartika Thahir had written in the third column, he could not recall their significance.
He found out later that the name of a German called `Hallal` must be `Haller` in German. The other name was Mazur. Referring to the diagram, General Moerdani told the court that the circle in the centre was the account and the other smaller circular points around it and the lines linking those small circles to the centre represented the moneys which were put into the account to be distributed amongst the three persons she had mentioned.
As for exh E8/77, General Moerdani said that the figure `35` was written by him; the rest of the handwriting was Mrs Kartika Thahir`s. He could not remember the significance of what she had written there; nor the significance of the figure `35`.
General Moerdani then produced two original documents, copies of which appear in exh E8/75 and 76. They were his notes which he made after his meeting with Mrs Kartika Thahir. They could have been made on the same day in his hotel room or on the following day in the aircraft. Some of the entries were in different coloured inks. In both documents, he set out option one and option two. Lower on the original document of E8/76 General Moerdani recorded in red ink the following in Indonesian: 
 
GVA 19 and 20 September 1977
 
 
 
* Ask for option #2
 
 
 
* H Thahir`s possessions in Singapore and Jakarta are about the same. In Jakarta plenty, practically all in the form of immovable assets.
 
 
 
* Due payments by S + K are DM15m and DM35m respectively.
 
 
 
* The money in the Sumitomo Bank is deposited on an annual basis that can be withdrawn at the end of each month.
 
 
 
* As to money in the Chase Manhattan and the Hongkong Banks, the amount is small/money for daily expenses.
 
 
 
General Moerdani explained that `GVA` meant Geneva and that the meeting took place before the two dates stated there. It was the meeting at Hotel Resident. He said by his first note, he meant to record his intention to ask Mrs Kartika Thahir to accept option two. The second entry merely recorded down what Mrs Kartika Thahir had told him previously. He understood that her purpose was to tell him that both families of the late General Thahir were left with about the same amount of money and property. The next entry referred to the money that was still kept in Munich which she told him to collect. The last entries recorded what she had told him. General Moerdani also told the court that, as recorded by him, Mrs Kartika Thahir had rejected both the options. He could not recall if she had rejected the options in a talk with him or through her daughter.
General Moerdani told the court that Mrs Kartika Thahir regarded her late husband as a private businessman, although he was an employee of Pertamina. She could not understand that as a government official, he could not receive commissions. He denied her allegations in her defence that he had told her in the presence of her daughter that `while it was no secret while he was alive that General Thahir received and held for his private use the funds represented by the ACU deposits it was not right for the widow to keep so large a fund for her private use`. He tried to tell her that he could not imagine one person could own so much money and that it was not right for her to keep the money. He said it was not common knowledge while General Thahir was alive that General Thahir received and held for his private use the funds represented by the ACU deposits.
The profound importance of the evidence of General Moerdani is appreciated by both sides. Mr Eder sought to undermine the effect of General Moerdani`s evidence by a three-pronged attack. The cross-examination and his submissions concentrated on (a) the discrepancies between the further and better particulars furnished by Pertamina and the evidence of General Moerdani; (b) the inconsistencies between Mr Hunt`s opening on this subject and General Moerdani`s evidence; and (c) certain parts of General Moerdani`s evidence which detract from any finding that Mrs Kartika Thahir had made the incriminatory admissions as alleged. I turn first to the discrepancies between the pleadings and General Moerdani`s evidence. Pertamina had averred that Mrs Kartika had made the admissions to General Moerdani in October 1977, which was later amended to September 1977, and that it was made at the lobby of Hotel Resident, Geneva, Switzerland. They further alleged that she had made the admissions to one
Mr Suji, who did not give evidence. Though there are inconsistencies, these were more attributable to precision of draftmanship, and in any case, they are quite immaterial. It also matters not that Mr Suji was not called by Pertamina. If
Mrs Kartika Thahir thinks that this approach is of any evidential effect, the question has to be asked why she did not in her own defence aver that the crucial meeting between her and General Moerdani had taken place in November 1977, and not September 1977, as Mr Eder had repeatedly put to General Moerdani in cross-examination. This line of attack did not in my view undermine the main thrust and effect of her clear admissions to General Moerdani. As for the contrast between Mr Hunt`s opening with General Moerdani`s evidence, I am satisfied that there is nothing in the point. I turn to the cross-examination of General Moerdani, which not unexpectedly was sustained and intensive. Mr Eder at one point managed to get General Moerdani to agree that the figures of 15 million and 35 million which Mrs Kartika Thahir was talking about were not the amounts in the account in Sumitomo Bank. However, looking at the relevant parts of the cross-examination, I am quite satisfied that General Moerdani was in giving that answer confused because he was referred to two of his four documents and he was then having in mind the sum of DM50m in a bank in Munich, which of course was not the money in Sumitomo Bank. Further, General Moerdani`s later evidence in cross-examination reaffirmed his evidence on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir. It also came through clearly to me that General Moerdani in dividing up the DM50m in a bank in Munich into DM15m and DM35m as having being paid by Siemens and Klockner merely made that inference on his part, having regard to her disclosures that the Deutschmarks deposits in Singapore were made up in those proportions. It was to me quite an understandable deduction, although its validity as a matter of strict logic is quite another matter. I have to emphasize that Mr Eder did not cross-examine General Moerdani to any effect on exhs E8/77 and 78. He also made the suggestion to General Moerdani that it was not the truth that Mrs Kartika Thahir had drawn the diagram and had written Hallal and Mazur. I need hardly say that a suggestion put to a witness is not evidence unless it is admitted, which there was none, and as I had said earlier, this court did not have the advantage of hearing and therefore assessing any evidence of Mrs Kartika Thahir. It is also of considerable significance that General Moerdani was not questioned on the figures which were recorded in exh E8/78 at the crucial meeting and on which both General Moerdani and Mrs Kartika Thahir had made their handwritten contributions. In the result, I had before me rather inconsequential questions by Mr Eder on that important contemporaneous document and a host of critical questions which were not put to General Moerdani. The deafening silence tells against Mrs Kartika Thahir. In the circumstances, I am compelled to reject Mr Eder`s criticisms of General Moerdani`s evidence. I should also add that General Moerdani`s composure and equanimity, in the face of repeated suggestions that his evidence had no coincidence in fact, rather impressed me. Throughout he remained a gentleman and did not in any way denigrate Mrs Kartika Thahir nor did he return measure for measure. At the end of the day, I was left in no doubt that he was clearly and unquestionably undergirded by the armour of truth. I have no hesitation in accepting his evidence as the whole truth. I therefore find as a fact that Mrs Kartika Thahir did admit to General Moerdani that the moneys in Sumitomo Bank came from Siemens as to DM15m and Klockner as to DM35m.
(d) Are the ACU deposits bribes?
One of the central questions of fact in this case is whether each of the 19 ACU deposits, as particularized in Annexure A of the statement of claim, are proceeds of bribes which Siemens and Klockner had paid General Thahir in relation to the Krakatau steel project or any other projects of Pertamina which Pertamina allegedly undertook for their own account or on behalf of PTKS. Pertamina seeks to prove that all the ACU deposits were the proceeds of bribes by the following evidence. Those evidence have been compendiously summarized in para 9(i)- (xi) of the statement of claim which, in my view, repays the most careful reading in the light of the evidence. Mrs Kartika`s defence, on the other hand, is also compendiously set out in para 10(i)-(ix), within which sub-paras 10(vii) and (viii) have been deleted. In considering whether Pertamina have discharged their legal and evidential burden, including the higher standard of proof in a case of this nature, it will be necessary also to bear in mind para 9 in the context of her entire defence.
The legal and evidential burden of proof that Pertamina paid Siemens and Klockner rests on Pertamina, as Pertamina accept. However, the questions whether Pertamina have discharged both the legal and evidential burden in respect of each of Pertamina`s alleged payments to Siemens and Klockner are very much in controversy. It is submitted on behalf of Mrs Kartika that a part of Pertamina`s allegations involve allegations of a fraudulent or criminal nature and that as a matter of the law of evidence it is necessary for Pertamina to prove their case to a high standard, which is higher than the standard in a non-fraud case: see 
 Hornal v Neuberger Products 
 ;1 
 Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij NV (Netherlands Trading Society) v Koh Kim Guan 
 2 where Rose CJ said at p 175: `Whatever the precise formula adopted and whatever the theoretical position may be, it has long been the practice in countries where the English system of law operates for the courts, in civil cases, to require a high standard of proof in cases where fraud is alleged.`; and 
 Tan Chye Chew & Anor v Eastern Mining and Metals Co Ltd 
 .3 However, it should be noted that it is not the law of evidence that every step in the allegation of fraud has to be proved by calling live and admissible evidence nor is it the law that fraud cannot be inferred in the appropriate case. In 
 Tan Chye Chew 
 ,3 for instance, the court was not dealing with the standard of proof and it seems to me clear from a reading of that case that it is no authority for the proposition, which appears to be suggested on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir, that fraud cannot be inferred. This is not to say that inferences of this serious nature should be lightly made. The circumstantial evidence must be so compelling and convincing that bearing in mind the high standard of proof one is nevertheless satisfied that an inference of fraud is justified. It will therefore be necessary to consider the evidence, if any.
First, Pertamina say that they have evidence to prove that they had from time to time paid Siemens and Klockner pursuant to the terms of payments set out in their contracts or PTKS`s contracts with Siemens and Klockner for materials supplied and work done in relation to the Krakatau steel mill and the infrastructures in the Cilegon industrial complex. These payments are particularized in Annexure B of the statement of claim.
Secondly, Pertamina say that General Thahir had deposited each of the 19 ACU deposits. Happily, Mrs Kartika Thahir conceded, as she reluctantly but inevitably had to in the face of the documents which were produced in court by Sumitomo Bank. These documents prove the gross amount of each ACU deposit made by General Thahir and the precise date on which each ACU deposit was made.
Thirdly, Pertamina contend that as a matter of fact Klockner had paid General Thahir the bribes at the rate of 13% of each of Pertamina`s payments so far as Matches 1, 2 and 3 are concerned; that Siemens had in truth and in fact paid General Thahir the bribes at the rate of 5% of each of Pertamina`s payment so far as Matches 4-10 are concerned; that Siemens had in fact paid General Thahir the bribe set out in Match 11 which related to two Pertamina`s projects in the Batam Island and for which Siemens were the contractors.
Fourthly, I refer to the six ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks and the two ACU deposits denominated in US dollars. For reasons which will appear later, it will be necessary to treat them as two separate categories, unless otherwise stated in this judgment. Pertamina`s case with regard to these two groups of ACU deposits is as follows. In the first place, they say the inevitable inference is that all eight unmatched ACU deposits must have been bribes which were paid by Siemens and Klockner. For this contention, they rely principally on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir to General Moerdani, although Mr Hunt recognizes in his closing speech that the two ACU deposits in US dollars are not `quite as straightforward as the Deutschmarks deposits`. In relation to the six unmatched Deutschmarks deposits, Pertamina also rely on a number of submissions to which I shall have to return.
I now turn to consider Pertamina`s proofs of their payments to Siemens and Klockner. For a start, I refer to those documents whose authenticity have been admitted by the solicitors of Mrs Kartika Thahir in their letter of 28 August 1991. In this connection it is most important to bear in mind that the authenticity of a document is quite different from the truth of the contents or the accuracy of that document. As for the documents, the authenticity of which is admitted by that letter, the position is that those documents are deemed to be authentic whether they are originals or copies and are to be treated as proof of their contents without more ado. With regard to those documents which are not covered by the said letter, Pertamina have to prove both their authenticity and their contents. Pertamina have to satisfy this court further that they may adduce secondary evidence and that they fall within the terms of s 67(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Pertamina rely on the evidence of Mr Zacharia Brori. From 1971 to 1991 he worked in the Finance Directorate of Pertamina. He said that between 1971 and 1975, Pertamina did not have photocopiers. Documents used to be typed with six carbon copies. In 1976 a xerox machine was used. In 1978 he assisted the team set up to assist Pertamina to recover the ACU deposits. He went to Pertamina`s warehouse and collected the documents relating to the Krakatau steel project. He brought the documents to Mr Ronald Grund, an accountant of the accounting firm of Arthur Young, who was helping in the investigations of this case. Ronald Grund selected the documents he needed and these carbon copies were photocopied. Mr Ronald Grund told this court that after he had completed his investigations and submitted his report, he returned to Mr Brori two boxes of documents, telling him to take care of the documents. He kept the two boxes of documents in the office of PT Petrajasa. He saw the two boxes two or three months after Mr Ronald Grund had left Pertamina. In 1985 PT Petrajasa moved office and someone moved the boxes of documents. The last time he saw the two boxes of documents were in another warehouse at Senopati, Indonesia. In 1991 he assisted in retrieving as many documents as possible. He had sworn affidavits as to every document which Pertamina had produced in the process of discovery. Where only copies were available, he thought that the originals or carbon copies had been lost in transit. I accept Mr Brori`s evidence and in consequence Pertamina are entitled to adduce secondary evidence of the relevant documents. However, Pertamina are still required to prove the authenticity of these documents and the truth of their contents and that they fall within ss 65 and 67 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97).
In relation to the question of proof covering the Pertamina payments with which the eleven matched deposits were linked, it is again conceded by Mrs Kartika Thahir that there was proof of the same.
The documents which go to prove Pertamina`s payments to Siemens and Klockner are the exhibits in bundle E6. The bundle is divided into bundle E6(I) and E6(II) and they respectively encompass the payment documents in connection with the eleven matched deposits and the unmatched deposits. Mr Nur Usman, who was treasurer of the Foreign Currency Department of Pertamina responsible for payments to foreign contractors (including Siemens and Klockner) gave evidence on many of the documents in bundles E6(I) and E6(II). Other officers in the accounts section within Pertamina, namely, Mr John Pattiwael, Mr Wirioputro, Ms Maryan Sandy, Mr Bakrie, Mr Rasjid, Mr Sani and Mr Wibawa, have also identified and confirmed various documents in the two bundles.
For instance, in respect of the unmatched deposits, 20 documents evidencing Pertamina`s payments have been identified and confirmed as proof of the payments. Their evidence described the accounting records which were maintained in Pertamina at the material time. Having considered their oral evidence, I am satisfied that in truth and in fact Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner sums of money in respect of the Krakatau steel project and the infrastructure facilities.
Inspite of the concessions of Mrs Kartika Thahir that Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner so far as the eleven matched payments are concerned, it is in my view necessary to set out the principal evidence. They are as follows: 
 
 
(1) Match 1: By letter of instruction E6(I)/13, Pertamina instructed the First National City Bank of Jakarta to pay to Klockner DM75,265,200 as down payment being 18% of Addendum No I and II to the contract dated 
 
23 January 1974 covering the railway and water supply facilities. The bank in writing advised the payment, which this court admitted under s 32 of the Evidence Act. 
 
(2) Match 2: Pertamina`s payments to Klockner resulted in a possible link with this single largest ACU Deutschmarks deposit of DM12,951,900. General Thahir was given Klockner`s cheque for this amount and as evidenced by 
 
exh E7/334, he presented the same to Sumitomo Bank in Singapore and signed an application for the bank to collect the proceeds thereof for credit to his ACU account with the bank. Pursuant to Pertamina`s application, Banque Nationale De Paris (`BNP`) opened a letter of credit in favour of Klockner for DM99.63m for the railway and water supply facilities. The manuscript of 
 
Mr Muthu Palaniappan, an officer of BNP, on the letter of credit was identified by him in evidence and he confirmed that BNP debited Pertamina US$38,910,369.07. By a letter dated 16 April 1980, which was written by and signed by Mr Balasubramaniam, BNP confirmed that they had paid on behalf of Pertamina, whom they debited, the sum relevant to Match 2. This letter also confirmed payments by and for the account of Pertamina in respect of Match 3, Match 8 (the third instalment) and Match 9. 
 
(3) Match 3(i): This matched deposit together with Match 3(ii) below together total DM10,793,250 which is the second largest ACU deposit made by General Thahir with Sumitomo Bank. It is again significant to note that Klockner had handed to General Thahir the cheque for that sum and he in turn by exh E7/253 applied to the bank to collect the proceeds which he instructed the bank after collection to be placed in his ACU account. The corresponding payment by Pertamina was made through BNP`s letter of credit. Mr Muthu confirmed that Pertamina was debited. Klockner`s receipt of DM20.304m was identified by Mr Muthu and this court admitted this document under s 32 of the Evidence Act. 
 
(4) Match 3(ii): The documents satisfied me that Pertamina had paid Klockner DM62.721m. 
 
(5) Match 4: The documents proved that Pertamina paid Siemens the sum of DM39,482,240 being the first down payment of 10% of the total price of the contract material and services which related to Point IV, Addendum I of the contract dated 16 August 1973. Siemen`s receipt for this sum was admitted by me. By a letter dated 12 June 1975 Siemens wrote to Pertamina, for the attention of Mr Nur Usman. They confirmed that as of 18 April 1975 they had received a total of DM133,864,460, all of which related to Matches 4,5,6 and the first two instalments of Match 8. In the `Statement B` annexed to that letter Siemens also acknowledged the receipt of DM159,657,680 as of 
 
18 April 1975 and these sums related to Matches 7, 9 and 10. They asked for payment of several overdue and future instalments due and payable, among which was the sum of DM8,899,980, which was paid, and which was matched to Match 8(iii). 
 
(6) Match 5: By telegraphic transfer effected by the Commerce Union Bank of Nashville, Tennessee, USA, Pertamina paid Siemens DM39,482,240. Siemens issued a receipt for this sum dated 18 January 1974 and the receipt was recorded in the accounting records of Pertamina. 
 
(7) Match 6: Pertamina paid Siemens the relevant sum of DM31,899,980 as instructed by Mr Anondo who confirmed his instructions in court. Siemens by their aforesaid letter of 12 June 1975 confirmed the receipt of this sum, although Siemens wrongly recorded the month of receipt as April 1974 when it should have been July 1974. 
 
(8) Match 7: The payments to Siemen which went to correlate to Match 7 were effected by eight instalments as more particularly recorded in the documentary evidence. Some of these payments were recorded in Pertamina`s accounting records, in their `bukti bank form`. As Siemens had confirmed by their Statement B annexed to their letter of 12 June 1975, they had received the sum of DM44,916,940 which correlated to this matching. 
 
(9) Match 8: The payments by Pertamina to Siemens were by three instalments effected through Moscow Narodny Bank for DM14m and DM9m on or about 6 March 1975 for the power generation and distribution plant and through BNP for DM8,899,980. They were the fourth instalment (10%) payable under the contract with Siemen. 
 
(10) Match 9: The documentary evidence confirmed that BNP paid Siemens for the account of Pertamina the sums of DM44,916,940 and DM12,453,430 in May 1974. They were the first down payments for both the contract materials and contract services and their total threw up Match 9 in relation to the DM ACU deposits. 
 
(11) Match 10: They were two sets of the second down payments for the contract materials and contract services under the contract bearing reference No 84/KONTR/PD-FRAST/74 dated 4 May 1974. First National City Bank of Jakarta, Indonesia paid DM44,916,940 and DM12,453,430 in June 1974 for the account of Pertamina whose accounting records confirmed the payments. As noted earlier, Siemens also confirmed receipt of these sums by Statement B annexed to their letter of 12 June 1975. 
 
(12) Match 11: Pertamina had an airport project and a diesel electric power station in Batam Island, Indonesia. In June 1973 they paid Siemens DM1,565,950 and DM734,183 through the Continental Bank International, New York, USA. The total of these sums threw up a 10% payment by Siemens to General Thahir.
  
 
 
In the circumstances, my finding is that Pertamina by the oral evidence of Mr Nur Usman and the other officers whom I have named have proved their payments to Siemens and Klockner which are set out in Annexure B. Further the evidence of Mr Balasubramaniam and Mr Muthu Palaniappan have also proved Pertamina`s payments through BNP. In the course of the trial I had also allowed and admitted evidence pursuant to s 32 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). These evidence independently satisfied me that Pertamina had made payments to Siemens and Klockner as they allege and as set out in Annexure B.
I now refer to another source of evidence led by Pertamina to prove their payments to Siemens and Klockner. They led the evidence of Mr Ronald Grund, a certified accountant, who worked between June 1965 and May 1985 in the audit department of Arthur Young & Co, the accountants of Pertamina. For the period from 1978 to 1984 he was a full-time consultant to the Finance Directorate of Pertamina, stationed in Jakarta. In late 1979 he joined Pertamina`s litigation team to recover the ACU deposits of General Thahir. He was given the task of establishing, if he could, the relationship between Pertamina`s payments to their contractors and General Thahir`s ACU deposits. He found that the accounting records within Pertamina were disorganized. But he said he successfully collated a bundle of documents which evidenced each payment by Pertamina to Siemens and Klockner. He kept the documents in his files which in turn were kept in boxes. He locked up those boxes in his cabinet in Pertamina`s office. In respect of documents outside Pertamina, he visited most of the banks in person to obtain information regarding Pertamina`s payments through those banks. Initially his visits did not turn up anything as the banks were unhelpful. After he had collated specific internal information based on documents on each payment, he renewed his requests to the banks. He obtained the verification from BNP: see exh E6(I)/27 and 29 by which BNP furnished details of the telegraphic transfers to Siemens. In E6(I)/27 Mr Grund had written a set of figures which related to Match 2 payments. His evidence was to the effect that he had seen accounting and documentary documents which proved Pertamina`s payments to Siemens and Klockner. In his cross-examination, Mr Eder questioned the admissibility of Mr Grund`s evidence on the basis that his entire evidence was hearsay. Mr Grund firmly disagreed. He said he carried out his checks on a very exacting standard which was very much higher than that applied in an ordinary audit. He said: `I can state as a matter of fact that these payments have been made on the dates indicated`. There, he was referring to exh I of his report in bundle F to Pertamina. That exhibit was dated 28 April 1980.
It was Mr Grund who first discovered the linkages between Pertamina`s payments and General Thahir`s ACU deposits. By a sophisticated computerized programme, he was able to pair off Pertamina`s payments and the ACU deposits. The percentages of 13% for the Klockner matches, 5% for the Siemens matches, and the 10% for match 11 were established by his investigative efforts. His entire methodology and the validity of his findings were confirmed by a piece of evidence which emerged in the early stages of this trial. I refer to the lack of any documentary evidence bearing on Pertamina`s payments so far as the 10% Match 11 is concerned. As has been noted earlier, documents which emerged from discovery during the trial confirmed that Pertamina had paid Siemens for the power station and the airport projects in Batam Island, Indonesia. Having reviewed his evidence, I was satisfied that his evidence proved two important issues of fact in this case. First, his evidence as a whole proved that Pertamina had paid Siemens and Klockner the sums set out in Annexure B. Secondly, his evidence also proved the linkages between Pertamina`s payments and General Thahir`s DM ACU deposits.
Mr Grund had enlisted the expertise of Dr Sutaip Saw Leng Chooi, a holder of a PhD in statistics. Dr Sutaip Saw opined in his report, exh F(B), that `(o)n the basis of our probabilistic analysis and the available data, we conclude that 
 there exists a relationship between deposits in Mr Haji Thahir`s account in the Sumitomo Bank of Singapore and payments to certain German contractors involved in the Krakatau steel project 
 `. He explained the statistical bases. He stated that in General Thahir`s Sumitomo account, there are three occurrences of an exact 5% relationship and two occurrences of an exact 13% relationship between a DM deposit in General Thahir`s account and a payment to one of the German contractors involved in the steel project. He concluded in the following terms: ` 
 The likelihood of observing such an event corresponds to approximately one in five hundred thousand chance if there is no relationship between deposits and payments 
 .` Dr Sutaip Saw wrote a full report on his methodology and his report contains a large amount of statistical formulae, which this court confesses it is unable to comprehend in any meaningful measure. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, and on the basis of whatever is plainly comprehensible in the report, it seems to me very likely than not that Dr Sutaip Saw`s opinion may be safely accepted.
In view of the overwhelming evidence, I find that in truth and in fact all 17 ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks were bribes which Siemens and Klockner had paid General Thahir. I would summarize my reasons as follows. I rely on the admissions of Mrs Kartika Thahir which she made to General Moerdani. Secondly, there is no evidence that General Thahir or Mrs Kartika Thahir had any fortune anywhere near the sums we are looking at. General Thahir`s tax returns do not begin to explain any legitimate source or sources of the ACU DM deposits. Thirdly, the 
 eleven 
 matched deposits, their percentages in relation to Pertamina`s payments and the dates of their initial deposits in most part following such payments are all tell-tale indications of bribes. Fourthly, I refer to General Thahir`s and Mrs Kartika Thahir`s misrepresentations to Mr Hotta and Mr Yamaura of Sumitomo Bank. I am convinced that General Thahir had struck his dishonest deals with the German contractors and to the knowledge of Mrs Kartika Thahir, they were making banking arrangements to deposit the bribes in a shroud of secrecy. Fifthly, I turn to the six 
 unmatched 
 deposits in Deutschmarks. I place great reliance on Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions. She confessed to General Moerdani that the DM50m in the bank came from Siemens as to DM15m and Klockner as to DM35m. Quite apart from her admissions, and some of the foregoing reasons, it is not unlikely in this case, as Mr Grund had explained, that there could be a number of reasons why these six deposits were unmatched.
I now turn to the two ACU deposits denominated in US dollars. By 23 July 1976 they had accumulated substantial interest and, as listed in items 18 and 19 in Annexure A, they had grown to US$593,249.31 and US$608,959.42. In fact, the two deposits were placed two or three years earlier. On 11 December 1973 General Thahir deposited with the bank ACU US$484,000 and on 27 March 1974 he deposited ACU US$500,000. Mr Hunt invites this court to infer that these two US dollar deposits were also proceeds of bribes. I decline to do so. Rather different considerations apply so far as these two deposits are concerned. Pertamina in my view have not led any evidence to discharge their legal and evidential burden of proof. Mrs Kartika Thahir`s admissions did not refer to these US dollar deposits. The US dollar deposits which she mentioned to General Moerdani were those placed with the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank and which she said were for her daily expenses. I bear in mind that each of the two US dollar deposits were separate and discrete and to taint them as bribes simply because they were placed in the same bank seems to me to be unwarranted. I have considered the long career of General Thahir and the fact that he had been in private business for a number of years. He was in the import and export business which dealt with commodities such as rubber and coffee. He also had financial interest in a shipping company. I am not prepared to infer that he could not have accumulated some fortune which would enable him to place the two US dollar deposits. I realize that his tax returns were modest; but inasmuch as they relate to his income and not his capital assets of every description, I cannot draw any unfavourable inference against him on the basis of those tax returns. Although there was strictly no evidence of General Thahir`s immovable properties in Indonesia, it has to be said that the averments of the estate of General Thahir in relation to his immovable properties in Jakarta and Palembang have not been controverted by Pertamina who could have done so if these averments were untrue. Accordingly, Pertamina have no claim on these two US dollar deposits.
(e) Role of Mrs Kartika Thahir According to her, she married General Thahir on 29 July 1974 but, as she had asserted in the Japanese proceedings, she had lived with him as man and wife for a period of about five years prior to the marriage. Pertamina are not concerned with the question of the validity of her marriage.
As she herself had revealed in the Japanese proceedings, sometime in August 1972 she and General Thahir had in Singapore met Mr Hotta, the chairman of Sumitomo Bank. Both of them discussed with Mr Hotta the opening of a joint account in the Singapore branch of that bank. She had emphasized to Mr Hotta that the deposits should be kept a secret and that each of them should retain the right of withdrawal without the consent of the other. She and General Thahir again met Mr Hotta in Tokyo, Japan in early 1974 and the subject of the deposit account was again discussed. By then, as the evidence established, General Thahir had made a number of deposits.
By her affidavit affirmed on 2 March 1977 and filed in these proceedings, she affirmed by para 3 thereof that `(i)n the early part of 1974, my husband and I were 
 introduced 
 to a Mr Shozo Hotta, the then chairman of [Sumitomo Bank], in Tokyo. She confirmed that General Thahir had a number of meetings with
Mr Hotta, at most of which she was present. In the following paragraph she claimed that in consequence of those meetings, and at Mr Hotta`s suggestion, General Thahir and she decided to open the joint account in the Singapore branch. As Mr Hunt points out, this part of her affidavit evidence is misleading in two respects. First, it suppressed the fact that they had met Mr Hotta as early as August 1972. Secondly, it does not sit well with the fact that General Thahir had placed some ACU deposits with the Singapore branch. I am satisfied that she had suppressed the fact of the August 1972 meeting and the fact that ACU deposits had been placed before early August 1974 because those facts would provide some incriminating basis for the assertion that before the first ACU deposit was placed, General Thahir and she, as she must have known, had struck their dishonest arrangements with Siemens and Klockner.
Her affidavit affirmed on 1 February 1980 is even more telling. She affirmed that she knew that General Thahir had received the ACU deposits, that General Sutowo as the president director of Pertamina had personal knowledge of General Thahir`s receipts of the moneys and that there was no suggestion from General Sutowo that any of the moneys belonged to Pertamina. She also disclosed that in 1976 General Thahir and she had planned to use some of the ACU deposits to attempt to purchase the Hyatt Hotel, Singapore and that the couple had a disagreement over this proposal.
Following the death of General Thahir, she withdrew moneys from the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Hong Kong Bank. She has not volunteered any information about those withdrawals.
In late 1976 or early 1977 Mrs Kartika Thahir met with Mr Ibrahim Thahir to discuss ways and means to collect from the German contractors moneys which were allegedly due and payable to General Thahir. To that end, in August 1977 she obtained a power of attorney from Mr Ibrahim Thahir acting for himself and the estate of General Thahir to authorize her to recover moneys allegedly owed to General Thahir by Siemens. An agreement in writing dated 29 August 1977 was entered into in Basel, Switzerland, between Mrs Kartika Thahir and Mr Ibrahim Thahir (who acted for General Thahir`s estate). By that agreement, both parties agreed that `all claims against Siemens roughly in the amount of DM15m were to be divided between the parties`.
Since she has elected not to give evidence on her own behalf, which she is perfectly entitled, she has not offered to this court any contrary evidence or explanations on those evidence which tell against her.
I would finally refer to the evidence of her admissions to General Moerdani. I need not repeat the evidence nor my findings which have been fully set out earlier in this judgment.
In the light of the evidence set out above, I am more than satisfied and almost sure (from the evidential point of view) that she was hand in glove with General Thahir in his dishonest schemes to receive the bribes and that she participated in and/or was privy to the receipt by General Thahir of the bribes which funded the 17 ACU deposits denominated in Deutschmarks. 
 Conflict of laws 
(a) Choice of law: Singapore law
Pertamina say first and foremost that the governing law in this case should be exclusively Singapore law, and that Indonesian law is irrelevant to any issue.
Reference was initially made to r 203, sub-r 1 of II 
 Dicey and Morris 
 (11th Ed), which gives guidance on the applicable law in a restitutional or quasi-contractual situation, that is, ascertaining the proper law of the obligation.
As to the determination of the proper law of the obligation, sub-r 2 is reproduced below: 
 
 
(a) if the obligation arises in connection with a contract, its proper law is the proper law of the contract; 
 
(b) if it arises in connection with a transaction concerning an immovable(land), its proper law is the law of the country where the immovable is situated (lex situs); 
 
(c) if it arises in any other circumstances, its proper law is the law of the country where the enrichment occurs.
  
 
 
Mr Hunt, for the plaintiffs, submits that it is sub-r 2(c) that applies in this case. Singapore law should apply as the lex causae, for Singapore is the place of ultimate enrichment. In 
Re Jogia (a bankrupt)
 
[1988] 1 WLR 484
[1988] 2 All ER 328
 it was held that in an action for money had and received, the proper law of the obligation will be the law of the place of receipt, since that is the place where the enrichment occurs. See also 
Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
Mr Eder, for Mrs Kartika Thahir, contends that Indonesian law is by no means irrelevant. He says that for the plaintiffs to succeed, they must establish a proprietary claim against the ACU deposits as a matter of Indonesian and Singapore law. Attention was drawn to the contract of employment between Thahir and the plaintiffs, and how Thahir acted in breach of his duty to the plaintiffs in his capacity as an employee. Since this was a breach of an implied obligation (not to take bribes) arising in connection with a contract, sub-r 2(a) should apply, and one should look towards the proper law of the contract, which in this case would be Indonesian law. For determining the proper law of the contract, see 
 Augustus v Permanent Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd 
 6 at p 252.
It is argued on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir that sub-r 2(c) only applies in `any other circumstances`, that is, situations not arising under (a) or (b). It has no application where the obligation arises in connection with a contract. The case of 
 Re Jogia 
 4 was cited in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 as a footnote to sub-r 2(c). Mr Eder also argues that in that case there was no prior contract existing between the parties. Similarly with 
 Chase Manhattan Bank 
 ,5 which dealt with money being erroneously credited and the benefit arose without any prior contract. It was also a sub-r 2(c) case.
The submission of Mr Eder is that where a bribe is accepted `in connection with a contract`, sub-r 2(a) must necessarily apply, and where a bribe is accepted without any prior contract, sub-r 2(c) would apply. The case of 
 Mahesan s/o Thambiah v Malaysia Government Officers` Co-operative Housing Society 
 7 was also cited, in which Lord Diplock suggested that a bribe may be recovered by a principal from his agent. At p 380E, his Lordship contemplated additional remedies that were available in circumstances where bribes were given in `connection with a contract`. And it was further said, that where it was given in connection with the contract between the principal and the briber, the principal was entitled to rescission of the contract. Mr Eder argues that this is in the language of sub-r 2(a).
I shall now set out what in my view is a proper reading of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 . Whilst the obligation to restore an unjust benefit may or may not arise in connection with a contract, the receipt of bribes, in all circumstances, will always fall under sub-r 2(c). The primary concern of parties in such a case is always to obtain recovery of moneys in the place of receipt or the place of enrichment. Its law should logically be the proper law of the obligation. I am aware that the 
 Dicey and Morris 
 explanation of sub-r 2(c) of the rule refers to the situation where benefit is conferred upon another person with whom no prior contract exists. In the authors` contemplations were circumstances where moneys were wrongly credited due to a mistake of fact; eg 
 Chase Manhattan 
 .5
Further, Lord Diplock`s remarks in 
 Mahesan 
 ,7 where he mentioned the giving of a bribe in connection with a contract, should be seen in the context of a principal`s alternative remedy of rescission of his contract with the briber. His Lordship was not dealing with r 203 in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 .
In relation to obligations that arise in connection with a contract under sub-r 2(a), the explanation in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , is in my view thorough. Here we are contemplating situations where one is seeking to recover money that is paid pursuant to an ineffective contract, or an illegal contract, to quote a few examples. It is notable that the authors did not contemplate the giving of bribes in connection with a contract.
A bribe is a bribe, and the lex causae in such a case must be the law of the place where enrichment takes place, within sub-r 2(c) of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 . In applying this test, the lex causae in the present case would be Singapore law.
Pertamina`s claim at common law. This is a cause of action in money had and received. It is a principal`s main cause of action against a bribed agent. Mr Hunt makes the correct observation that whilst the relationship between principal and agent is one always founded on contract, the obligation to restore the bribe as money had and received to the principal`s use does not arise in connection with the contract in the sense of sub-r 2(a) cited above.
Applying the above interpretation of r 203 of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , an action for money had and received is a cause of action that falls under sub-r 2(c). A number of authorities were cited on behalf of Pertamina.
The case of 
 Bowling v Cox 
 .8 This case concerned the grant of leave to serve proceedings out of jurisdiction, based on the construction of s 29 of Ch X of the Consolidated Laws of British Honduras. A trustee was making a claim against an estate for interest that was due to creditors. It was alleged that the estate had earned interest from some assets in British Honduras, which the executor remitted to the United States of America.
It was held that the executor was a trustee, justifying service out of the jurisdiction. Part of the ratio is that the receipt of the moneys by an attorney on behalf of the executor took place in British Honduras, where he obtained the money. The court held that the action for money had and received arose out of and by reason of the fact that the money had been got in by the respondent through his attorney in British Honduras (at p 754). The place of receipt was in British Honduras. It was there that the cause of action arose. Mr Eder points out that the claim by the trustee in bankruptcy did not arise in connection with any prior contract. Based on the above analysis, in the case of bribes, where the recovery at common law is an action in money had and received, the matter is dealt with under sub-r 2(c). In the case of bribes, therefore, the not unimportant consideration of whether there was a prior contract is immaterial.
Further, it is also submitted by Mr Eder that as a matter of the conflict of laws, 
 Bowling v Cox 
 8 did not state any general proposition that all claims for the recovery of moneys are to be determined by reference to the law of the place of receipt of the moneys in question. I am aware that the case deals with issues of jurisdiction, and as such has no direct bearing on choice of law. The case is, however, of assistance in determining where the cause of action for money had and received arises.
The case of 
 Rousou`s (a bankrupt) Trustee v Rousou 
 .9 Both Mr Hunt and Mr Eder are in agreement that this is a case of doubtful authority. It concerned the claim of a trustee in bankruptcy to recover from the defendants moneys formerly the property of the bankrupt, that were received in Cyprus. Order 11 service was granted on the basis that it was a right that was quasi-contractual in nature. The decision of 
 Bowling v Cox 
 8 was arguably misapplied; since the money was received in Cyprus, the cause of action for money had and received arose there. Writ service under O 11 should have been denied.
The case of 
 Re Jogia 
 .4 Another O 11 case, involving a trustee in bankruptcy who claimed against a French company for having exceeded the commission that was chargeable over the purchase of gold bullion by a bankrupt. On the application of the defendants, O 11 service was set aside because firstly, the bankrupt had agreed to pay the company`s reasonable charges, and the court found that the French company had made a reasonable financing charge. Secondly, there was a choice of jurisdiction clause favouring the commercial court of Paris.
More importantly, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC took the view that the cause of action, in the case of a quasi-contractual obligation, arose in the place of receipt. He says at p 495H: 
 
As at present advised, I am of the view that quasi-contractual obligations of this kind arise from the receipt of the money. I find it difficult to see how such obligation can be said to be made or arise in any place other than that of the receipt. As to the proper law, 
 Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws
 (10th Ed, 1980) Vol 2 p 921 r 170 expresses the view that, save in cases where the obligation to repay arises in connection with a contract or an immoveable, the proper law of the quasi-contract is the law of the country where the enrichment occurs. This accords with the American Restatement and seems to me to be sound in principle.
 
 
 
In this passage is contained strong support for the 
 Dicey and Morris 
 analysis, and that an action for money had and received is governed by sub-r 2(c). It also does not contradict the wider application of sub-r 2(c) to bribes in general.
Referring to the passage quoted above, Mr Eder submits that the cause of action that arises in the place of receipt of the money is only limited to the context of the payment of money by mistake to a third party. This argument is not sustainable, as in 
 Re Jogia 
 ,4 payment was deliberate.
Further, Mr Eder observes that the judge implicitly approved his perceived distinction drawn in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , r 203, between sub-r 2(a) and sub-r 2(c). He argues that there was no prior contract between the bankrupt and the French company, and therefore the case fell properly under sub-r 2(c). On his analysis if there was a contract, it would fall under sub-r 2(a) and the lex causae would have been the proper law of the contract.
In his reply, Mr Hunt refers to p 488G, where it was said that the outlined scheme in question was agreed between the company and the bankrupt, and that there was no direct contract between the bankrupt and the company, since the bankrupt`s agreement to the terms proposed was communicated to one Penalia. However at p 490F, it emerged that Penalia was an agent for the bankrupt, and in that capacity paid the French company. Two observations should be made. First, the bankrupt was in an indirect contractual relationship with the French company through the agency of Penalia. Secondly, a contractual relationship of this character would similarly exist between the French company and the trustee in bankruptcy.
In my view the contractual relationship that was discovered in 
 Re Jogia 
 4 further illustrates the discrepancy inherently present in the distinction between sub-r 2(a) and sub-r 2(c), of the kind advanced by Mr Eder. It is the cause of action for money had and received that puts the case under the 2(c) category, even if a contractual relationship is present.
Conclusion: It does appear from the authorities cited that at common law the cause of action for money had and received arises in the place of receipt. When the money was deposited by General Thahir in Singapore, that is where the action for money had and received arose.
Considering the lex causae, in so far as the claim is based on the substantive law of money had and received, the matter is wholly governed by Singapore. This is quite clear from the application of r 203(2)(c) of 
 Dicey and Morris 
 , and in particular the leading case of 
 Re Jogia 
 .4
Pertamina`s claim in equity: Under this heading a number of authorities was cited to the court, with the view to establish Singapore law as the applicable law in the claim to trace funds in a Singapore bank account, or the imposition of a constructive trust, the foundation of which is an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by General Thahir. They are considered below.
The case of 
 Lord Cranstown v Johnston 
 .10 This was an action brought in England concerning an interest in land in the West Indies in circumstances where the defendant had obtained judgment in a foreign jurisdiction, that is the courts of St Christopher, and had done so validly in accordance with the local laws and an English arbitration award that was executed there. The defendant subsequently purchased the interest in those lands at a very low price.
The court affirmed that it cannot act upon land directly, but acts upon the conscience of the person living there. In these circumstances the court could not permit the defendant to obtain an unfair advantage through the laws of St Christopher`s and the execution of the English arbitration award in that jurisdiction (see p 959 per Arden MR).
Mr Eder says that the case establishes a general but limited proposition that ` ... with regard to any contract made or equity between persons in this country respecting lands in a foreign country ...` the court will hold the same jurisdiction as if the lands were situated in England. The case does not go further than that.
Mr Hunt, on the other hand, contends that the case establishes the more general principles that: first, equity acts in personam, and secondly, courts of equity apply their own rules. Applying the latter proposition to the present case, it means that a Singapore court will apply the lex fori when exercising its equitable jurisdiction.
Mr Eder strongly submits at the very outset that such a view is untenable. There is no authority for any such proposition in any textbook. It is also unmentioned in 
 Dicey and Morris 
 ; for if it is the law, then a proviso would have been entered by the authors just below r 203. Mr Eder is also of the view that the general proposition meant that one completely ignores any foreign law when dealing with equitable claims, and this was a negative point.
Clearly the case was not concerned with conflict of laws as such, but with the jurisdiction of the court of equity to act.
The case of 
 Deschamps v Miller 
 .11 This was another jurisdiction case, where the general principle was stated by Parker J that an English court will not adjudicate on questions relating to the title or the right to the possession of immovable property situated out of the jurisdiction of that court. The exceptions to this principle merit consideration. At p 863 his Lordship did not give an exhaustive list, but in essence concluded that they all depend on some personal obligation arising out of contract, implied contract, fiduciary relationship, or other conduct which, in the view of the court of equity, is unconscionable.
Mr Hunt submits that based on the above, Singapore courts apply their own concepts of what amounts or does not amount to unconscionable conduct or a fiduciary relationship, a breach thereof or fraud, in deciding whether it can exercise its equitable jurisdiction.
Mr Eder considers the 
 Deschamps 
 decision11 to be irrelevant, since it is not concerned with the conflict of laws.
The case of 
 British South Africa Co v De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd 
 .12 To my mind, a most important case, and it concerns the `clogs doctrine` - the equitable rule against clogging the redemption of a mortgage with regard to an English contract for the issue of debentures. In this case the equitable rule was enforced against a contracting party in the jurisdiction even though the floating security that was created comprised land in a foreign jurisdiction in which the `clogs` doctrine was not recognized.
The ratio of the 
 Cranstown 
 decision10 was given strong endorsement by Cozens-Hardy MR at p 513: 
 
For centuries the Court of Chancery has, by virtue of its jurisdiction in personam, applied against parties to a contract or trust relating to foreign land the principles of English law, although the lex situs did not recognize such principles. The judgment of Lord Alvanley in 
 Lord Cranstown v Johnston
 3 Ves 170 at p 182 asserts this in very strong language: `With regard to any contract made or equity between persons in this country respecting lands in a foreign country, particularly in the British Dominions, this court will hold the same jurisdiction as if they were situated in England.`
 
 
 
Mr Hunt refers to the case as being strong support for the principle in 
 Cranstown 
 .10 A court of equity applies its own rules. It is also submitted that in the present case, the Singapore court is in a position to exercise its jurisdiction in rem, because this is where the money is situated.
Mr Eder seeks to distinguish this case from the instant case on the basis that it dealt solely with the jurisdiction of the English courts to act in personam in respect of an English law contract; in circumstances where the contract was governed by English law, or in administering equities between parties already resident in England. See p 518, per Farwell LJ; p 520, per Kennedy LJ.
It is to be observed that the above cases have thus far dealt only with the jurisdiction of a court of equity to act in personam. To this extent, I find myself in agreement with Mr Eder. These authorities have no bearing on deciding whether an equity exists in the first place, and furthermore which law should govern.
The case of 
 Re Anchor Line (Henderson Brothers) Ltd 
 .13 This was the case where a liquidator took out an originating summons to determine whether a valid and effectual charge had been created over the moveable property of a company which was situated, at the commencement of liquidation, in Scotland. It was held, inter alia, that in considering the validity of the charge, English law should be applied, following the 
 De Beers 
 decision.12
Noteworthy is the extension of principle to moveable property. Luxmoore J said at p 488: 
 
... and in determining whether there is an equity the court regards English, not foreign law, and if according to English law there is an equity, eg if for valuable consideration a company agrees to give a charge on foreign property, the court will enforce it, although the equity may be one not recognized by the lex loci rei sitae.
 
 
 
Courts of equity will apply their own rules to determining whether there is an equity. In the present case, it would be a matter for Singapore law whether there is an equity or not.
Mr Eder contends that the reference at p 488 was based on a misreading of the case, stating that English rules were applied because English law was the lex causae governing the floating charge. It is further argued that the same principle would not apply to a claim arising in connection with a contract which was itself governed by foreign law, as in the present case.
I think that this is not the case. The `court will enforce it, although the equity may be one not recognized by the lex loci rei sitae`. I believe that the same principle will apply even with a foreign lex causae. See 
 National Commercial Bank v Wimborne 
 .14
It is observed that many English cases would have English law as the lex causae. One cannot ignore the realistic possibility of proceedings commenced abroad, or stays of action, in the case of a foreign lex causae. In the case of the latter, there is the forum non conveniens doctrine. One of the factors determining an appropriate forum abroad so as to justify a stay is the applicable law: see 
 Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd 
 15 and 
 De Dampierre v De Dampierre 
 .16 (There are generally more stays granted after the 
 Spiliada 
 decision,15 since Lord Goff downgraded the importance of advantages accruing to the plaintiff from having trial in England.)
The case of 
 National Commercial Bank v Wimborne 
 .14 This was a claim for interlocutory relief restraining the defendants from removing assets from Australia and from disposing certain assets which could be traced to certain loan funds which were held on trust.
It was argued by the defendants that Swiss law, being the lex causae, precluded the relief sought. The plaintiffs could not be entitled to claim such remedies in New South Wales. Holland J, sitting in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (equity division) took the following view: 
 
... the plaintiffs are claiming equitable rights and equitable remedies. The equity court has long taken the view that because it is a court of conscience and acts in personam, it has jurisdiction over persons within and subject to its jurisdiction to require them to act in accordance with the principles of equity administered by the court wherever the subject matter and whether or not it is possible for the court to make orders in rem in the particular matter. In short, if the defendant is here, the equities arising from a transaction to which he is a party as ascertained by New South Wales law and the equitable remedies provided by that law will be applied to him.
 
 
 
Thus it was said that the equity court determines according to the lex fori whether an equity exists, its nature and the remedy available. His Lordship cited the above cases in support. A fortiori if the property sought after is also within the jurisdiction of the court.
Mr Eder`s comment on earlier cases that English rules were applicable only because it was assumed that English law was the applicable law runs counter to the proposition set out in this case. The lex causae in this case was foreign, ie Swiss law, yet the court still applied NSW rules. This is one instance where the assumption that the contract arose in English law broke down.
Mr Eder also submits that the judgment and views expressed in the case were not final, and that the court was only concerned with justifying the grant of interlocutory relief. I am unable to accept these arguments. It appears to me that Holland J`s remarks were definitely more than tentative, and having to prove a sufficiently arguable case necessarily meant going into the substance of trial. 
 United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd 
 17 is another NSW decision. It was a case where the plaintiffs made a claim for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, contractual obligations and conspiracy following the defendant`s termination of a distributorship agreement in relation to surgical stapling instruments and disposable loading units.
The court upheld, inter alia, what has become the cardinal principle that (at p 798C): 
 
Where a defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court, the court may grant equitable relief in accordance with equitable principles as administered in the forum provided that the defendant while resident in the forum was guilty of conduct which, by offending against those principles, gave rise to the occasion for such regulation.
 
 
 
Equitable relief was thus administered according to the lex fori.
Mr Shanmugam for Mrs Kartika Thahir argues that the views expressed above were obiter, since the judge reached the conclusion that there was no material difference between the various systems of law, and that the views are all tentative. In my opinion the passage quoted above is part of the ratio of the case, and is consistent with the 
 Wimborne 
 decision.14
Mr Shanmugam also makes reference to the passage at p 798C as being concerned with whether the particular defendant can be said to have been guilty of such conduct while `resident within the forum`. I think it can safely be said that the mention of `residency` goes to jurisdiction, even then it is not necessary if the court is otherwise able to exercise jurisdiction over him. I do not think that 798C gives rise to any `test` of the kind advanced by Mr Shanmugam. It would seem sufficient that the defendant while resident within the forum is guilty of conduct which by offending the principles of equity administered by that forum gives rise to `the occasion for such regulation`.
Conclusion: From the authorities cited under this heading I am of the view that the forum will apply its own rules in deciding whether it has equitable jurisdiction: 
 Deschamps 
 11 and 
 De Beers 
 .12
Considering the lex causae: the forum will similarly apply its own law to determine the kind of equitable obligations that arise from the unconscionability of the defendant`s acts: 
 Wimborne 
 14 and 
 US Surgical 
 ;17 even in the case of moveable property: 
 Re Anchor 
 .13
It follows that as with the position at common law, Singapore law will necessarily govern. It is only logical that one should look at both the claims at common law and in equity by reference to the same system of law.
(b) Choice of law: the combination of Singapore and Indonesian laws.
The lex fori will govern remedies: 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 As to the law governing the substantive obligations, there are realistically two possibilities according to
Mr Hunt: 
 
 
(1) Indonesian law governs every other substantive issue; eg was Thahir`s conduct unlawful, whether he was a fiduciary, whether the bribes belonged to the plaintiff, etc. 
 
(2) Indonesian law only considers the question of whether Thahir`s activities were unlawful. On this analysis, questions of whether Thahir was a fiduciary and whether bribes are to be regarded as belonging to Pertamina - will be decided by Singapore law. It was said by Goulding J in 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 that the question of whether the individual is to be regarded as a fiduciary, or whether the property is to belong to the plaintiff, is inexorably connected to the existence of the remedy.
  
 
 
If necessary, I am of the view that in any combined application of the two systems of law to resolve the disputes in these proceedings, the combination as set out under item (2) is more justified.
(c)Choice of law: lex fori may apply in the absence of a conflict
This alternative is feasible if General Thahir is found to be a mandatory under Indonesian law. If there is no material difference between Singapore law and Indonesian law, there is no conflict to be resolved: see 
Chase Manhattan
 
[1981] Ch 105
[1979] 3 All ER 1025
[1980] 2 WLR 202
 at p 120A per Goulding J; 
 US Surgical v Hospital 
 17 at p 798B-G per McClelland J. In 
 US Surgical 
 17 it was held, inter alia, that the law of New South Wales (lex fori) should be applied in determining what relief was available except to the extent that a material difference was proved to exist between the relevant laws of NSW, New York and Connecticut.
What amounts to a `material difference` between two systems of law? Reference is again made to McClelland J`s judgment in 
 US Surgical v Hospital 
 ,17 at pp 798G-799B: 
 
... having heard a considerable amount of evidence from highly qualified witnesses as to the New York/Connecticut relating to fiduciary relationships and duties and the consequences of breaches of such duties, or at least as to so much of the law as might apply to the facts disclosed in the present proceedings. I have formed the view that there is no material difference between the law of those places and that of New South Wales on those subjects relevant to those facts. In both systems the development of the fiduciary concept has proceeded by equitable principles derived from the law of England ...
 
 
 
In the present case, under Indonesian law the concepts of a trust or fiduciary are non-existent. For that reason, I am of the view that this forms a sufficient material difference for a conflict to arise.
 Recovery under Singapore law
(a) Money had and received
Although bribery as a civil wrong must have existed, it is a little surprising that there has been no case before the Judicature Act 1875 reporting a successful claim at law for the recovery of a bribe by a principal from his agent. Equity as will be seen in the next section had imposed a constructive trust on the bribed agent: see 
Fawcett v Whitehouse
 
[1829] 1 Russ & M 132
[] 39 ER 51
 It must have been recognized, as it was later in the following case, that the law must forbid the bribery of agents because the effect of a bribe is to put the agent in a position in which his interest conflicts with his duty.
By 1888, Bowen LJ in 
 Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co v Ansell 
 19 at p 367 ruled that a bribe is recoverable at common law as money had and received by the agent to the use of his principal: 
 
... the law implies a use, that is to say, there is an implied contract, if you put it as a legal proposition - there is an equitable right, if you treat it as a matter of equity - as between the principal and agent that the agent should pay it over, which renders the agent liable to be sued for money had and received, ... and to take it out of the hands of the agent, which gives the principal a right to relief in equity.
 
 
 
Slade J in 
 Industries and General Mortgage Co Ltd v Lewis 
 20 usefully indicated what constitutes a bribe in civil law or in a non-criminal law context. He said at p 575F-H: 
 
For the purposes of the civil law a bribe means the payment of a secret commission, which only means (i) that the person making the payment makes it to the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; (ii) that he makes it to that person knowing that that person is acting as the agent of the other person with whom he is dealing; and
 
 
 
(iii) that he fails to disclose to the other person with whom he is dealing that he has made that payment to the person whom he knows to be the other person`s person. Those three are the only elements necessary to constitute the payment of a secret commission or bribe for civil purposes.
 
 
 
Once the payment and receipt of a bribe is established, courts have applied certain rules. 
 
Among them the following are now established, and, in my opinion, rightly established, in the interests of morality with the view of discouraging the practice of bribery. First, the court will not inquire into the donor`s motive in giving the bribe, nor allow evidence to be gone into as to motive. Secondly, the court will presume in favour of the principal and as against the briber and the agent bribed, that the agent was influenced by the bribe; and this presumption is irrebuttable. Thirdly, if the agent be a confidential buyer of goods for his principal from the briber, the court will assume as against the briber that the true price of the goods as between him and the purchaser must be taken to be less than the price paid to, or charged by, the vendor by, at any rate, the amount or value of the bribe. [See Romer LJ in 
Hovenden & Sons v Millhoff
 
[1900] 83 LT 41
[1900-3] All ER Rep 848
 at p 43.]
 
 
 
Regarding remedies, it has been authoritatively laid down in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 7 at p 383G-H per Lord Diplock that: 
 
... the principal has these alternative remedies: (1) for money had and received under which he can recover the amount of the bribe as money had and received or, (2) for damages for fraud, under which he can recover the amount of the actual loss sustained in consequence of his entering into the transaction in respect of which the bribe was given, but he cannot recover both.
 
 
 
The common law action will arise whenever the agent has been enriched by his own wrongdoing at the expense of his principal. The giving or taking of the bribe is the wrongful conduct which founds the action. The bribee`s enrichment is at the expense of the principal, in the sense that the bribe was obtained by virtue of his position as agent, servant or partner of the principal. Damage is not the gist of the action; it therefore matters not whether the principal has suffered any loss, or that the principal could not have obtained for himself the money which the defendant received: see 
 Reading v The King 
 .22
In proceedings against the bribed agent, the principal is entitled to recover from him the amount of the bribe. That was decided in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 .7 The society`s agent found a piece of land in Penang which was suitable for the purposes of the Society. He conspired with Manickam who bought the land for $456,000 and resold it to the Society for $944,000. The agent, unknown to the Society, received a bribe of $122,000, which was one-quarter of the gross profit which Manickam made. The Privy Council held that at common law a principal could recover from his bribed agent either the amount of the bribe as money had and received, or, alternatively, compensation for the actual loss sustained through entry into the transaction in respect of which the bribe was given as damages for fraud. We are concerned with the former cause of action and not the latter alternative cause of action based on fraud or, on one view, civil conspiracy.
In these proceedings, it is accepted on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir that a claim for money had and received lies against a bribee on the authority of 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 ,7 notwithstanding that the bribe cannot be directly traced to the plaintiff or shown to be Pertamina`s money. That is the effect of 
 Mahesan 
 7 so far as concerns a principal`s claim against the bribed agent in an action for money had and received. In 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,23 there was a claim for money had and received under a mistake of fact. It was decided that it could not be shown that the defendants had received the plaintiffs` money because of the mixing of the money in the New York clearing system and therefore the plaintiffs` claim for money had and received under a mistake failed: per Millet J at pp 282F-H, 285B-H and 289C-H. That point was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,24 per Fox LJ at pp 563C-566F. Mrs Kartika Thahir therefore accepts that the point which defeated the claim for money had and received under a mistake of fact in 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Co 
 ,23 affirmed on that point by the Court of Appeal, did not stand in the way of Pertamina`s claim against General Thahir for recovery of the bribe.
Mr Eder also accepts that if a sum of money can be shown to be a plaintiff`s money which was received by the immediate recipient and then paid on to a volunteer, for eg a mistress, then a claim in money had and received will lie against the volunteer. He accepts the decision in 
 Banque Belge Pour L`Etranger 
 
 v Hambrouck & Ors 
 .25 H in that case by forged cheques induced the plaintiff bank to part with o6,000 of their money which another bank collected for and held to the credit of H in his account with that bank. No fund was paid into that account except the proceeds of the forged cheques. H was living with Mlle Spanoghe to whom he paid various sums of money out of the said bank account. Mlle Spanoghe paid the moneys into a deposit account which she kept with another bank. Again no other sum was paid into that deposit account. The balance, o315, was the subject of plaintiff bank`s claim. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff bank was entitled to recover it, taking the view that there could be tracing at common law.
However, Mr Eder says that Pertamina have no claim to the bribe unless they can show that where, as here, the bribe is paid to a volunteer, like Mrs Kartika Thahir, what was paid to Mrs Kartika Thahir was in fact Pertamina`s money. On the facts in this case, Pertamina will fail to show that the bribes were their money because the money paid by Pertamina to Siemens and Klockner must have lost its identity and was mixed in the general accounts of the two German contractors, just as Agip (Africa) Ltd`s money did when mingled in the New York clearing system. No authority has been cited to support Mr Eder`s contention. In principle it does not seem right to say that the cause of action for money had and received may or may not be available against a volunteer to whom the immediate recipient had paid the money. Further, as was pointed out by Millet J, at p 285E: `Money can be followed at common law into and out of a bank account and into the hands of a subsequent transferee, provided that it does not cease to be identifiable by being mixed with other money in the bank account derived from some other source.`
In my view, Pertamina have a right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits as money had and received by her to their use. Secondly, by reason of her complicity in the entire corrupt bargain, she also participated in or was privy to the receipt by General Thahir of the bribes which funded the ACU DM deposits. Since Pertamina would have had a right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits from General Thahir, they are so entitled to recover from the estate of General Thahir.
(b) Recovery in equity
(i) Constructive trusts generally. A court of law will declare that a person is a constructive trustee in respect of any property if his conduct is such as to warrant the imposition of a constructive trust. A court in considering whether to impose it will not take into consideration the intention of any of the parties. In contrast, an express trust or a resulting trust will arise dependent on the intention, express or implied, of a settlor. Thus, it is the conduct of the person who may be declared a constructive trustee by a court which is closely scrutinized and examined and that conduct is the common element in the usual cases where a constructive trust is ordered to arise by operation of law. Constructive trusts may be classified under several groups. But only for present purposes, it is convenient that constructive trusts may be grouped under three well-defined categories, viz (1) where a person has obtained an advantage by acting fraudulently or unconscionably or in certain situations inequitably; (2) where a fiduciary has obtained an advantage as a result of a breach of his duty of loyalty; and (3) where there has been a disposition of trust property in breach of trust: see AJ Oakley 
 Constructive Trusts 
 (2nd Ed) p 17.
Every kind of trust is a relationship in respect of property under which the trustee is obliged to deal with the property vested in him for the benefit of the beneficiary. It follows that when any property is declared to be the subject matter of a constructive trust, the imposition of the trust by that mere fact will give the beneficiary proprietary rights in the property. The property, in consequence, does not form part of the assets of the trustee in the case of the trustee`s insolvency. So long as the property exists and is not dissipated, the beneficiary may trace it at common law, where tracing is used as a tool of evidence to identify the beneficiary`s property, or in equity (which imposes a charge on it) to recover it. The proprietary right to trace and recover the trust property remains exercisable against a volunteer who has acquired legal ownership of the property. The beneficiary`s charge in equity over the trust property which arises under the constructive trust, however, ceases upon the vesting of the legal estate of the property on a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the trust.
To complete this prefatory part on the law of constructive trust, it should be pointed out that the imposition of a constructive trust gives rise to liabilities as against the constructive trustee both of a proprietary and of a personal nature. The former is an in rem remedy against the property over which the constructive trust is imposed. The latter is the personal liability of the constructive trustee to account to or compensate the beneficiary. These remedies may be pursued in the alternative or cumulatively, depending on the availability and identity of the property by tracing at law or in equity for recovery. If a proprietary remedy is no longer available or if the trust property is no longer identifiable by tracing at law or in equity, or if, for instance, it has been sold to a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, the beneficiary is then left with a constructive trust action against the trustee to account and to pay compensation to him. This remedy in personam is, of course, worth the powder and shot only if the trustee is not insolvent. In rare cases, and in principle, a beneficiary under a constructive trust may exercise both his proprietary and personal remedy against the trustee where the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant it; for instance, where the property has been devalued by reason of the trustee`s breaches of duties. The distinction between the two types of remedies recently featured in the context of a mareva injunction application in 
 Polly Peck International plc v Nadir 
 .26
So far as the nature of remedy is concerned in this case, it is common ground between the parties that if the only remedy afforded by equity to Pertamina is a remedy in personam against General Thahir merely to account and that Pertamina do not have a proprietary remedy, as Mrs Kartika Thahir contends, Pertamina will fail in their claims in equity to the 17 ACU DM deposits. In that case, Pertamina`s claim at law for money had and received would be crucial as affording a route to recover the bribes.
In the instant case, the nature of the remedy we will be considering is whether a constructive trusteeship should be imposed on General Thahir under the second category and on Mrs Kartika Thahir under the first category.
Pertamina claim that they are entitled to recover in equity by making three principal submissions. They say, firstly, that the well-known case of 
 Lister & Co v Stubbs 
 27 is no bar to their right to recover the 17 ACU DM deposits because that case was wrongly decided or, at the very least, should not be followed in the present case. Secondly, Pertamina contend that they are entitled to assert a proprietary claim to the 17 ACU deposits without the need to establish that there was a fiduciary relationship between themselves and General Thahir. Thirdly, and in the alternative, they submit that if it is necessary that there should be a fiduciary relationship between themselves and General Thahir for them to be entitled to assert a proprietary claim to the 17 ACU DM deposits, then such a relationship existed. Mr Eder on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir challenges each of these broad submissions advanced on behalf of Pertamina. I shall now consider them in turn.
(ii) Is 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 wrong? Before I consider in detail the arguments and the principles enunciated in the extensive body of case law, perhaps I should set out in broad terms the respective submissions. Mr Hunt seeks to persuade me that 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 is, in the first place, inconsistent with previous authority: these are 
 Keech v Sandford 
 ;28 
 Fawcett v Whitehouse 
 ;18 
 Sugden v Crossland 
 29 and 
 Morison v Thompson 
 .30
In the second place, he contends that 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 is inconsistent with the `property` cases, viz: 
 Re Morvah Consols Tin Mining Co, McKay`s Case 
 ;31 
 Re Caerphilly Colliery Co, Pearson`s Case 
 ;32 
 Nant-Y-Glo and Blaina Ironworks Co v Grave 
 ;33 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 34 (in the analysis of 
 Metropolitan Bank 
 ,34 Mr Hunt says that the law took a wrong turning and that this case is the source and origin of the error which led to 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 ;27 and in referring to the particular passage of the judgment of James LJ to the effect that the learned Lord Justice could not `see how a bribe paid to an agent (could) be considered as money had and received for the use of the principal` Mr Hunt points out that the learned Lord Justice has been overtaken by the Privy Council in 
 Mahesan v Malaysia Housing Society 
 7); 
 Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co v Ansell 
 ;19 and 
 Eden v Ridsdales Railway Lamp and Lighting Co Ltd 
 .35
Mr Hunt in his third and final broad attack against 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 says that it is clearly and unacceptably out of line with the well-established principle of equity that a fiduciary should not be permitted to retain any profit, let alone bribes, obtained by abuse of his position. In accepting bribes, a fiduciary agent puts himself in a position of conflict with his duty of loyalty which he owes to his defrauded principal and I understand Mr Hunt to be submitting that a court of equity must not countenance the taking of bribes and must use every available means to deter corrupt practices.
On behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir Mr Eder says that the absence of any proprietary or `tracing` claim with regard to bribes was established by two Court of Appeal cases, viz 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 34 and 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 27 which made the clear demarcation even in equity and when considering equitable remedies between 
 obligation 
 and 
 property

 .44 Mr Eder for reasons which I will set out later disagrees with Mr Hunt and contends that the earlier English cases are not inconsistent with 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 .27
I now return to the analysis in detail; unfortunately, and unavoidably, it has to be extensive and intensive.
Since 
 Lister v Stubbs 
 ,27 it has been generally assumed that there is no proprietary or `tracing` claim against a bribed agent where the bribe is in the form of money.
The plaintiffs were a company manufacturing silk spinners and dyers. The deft Stubbs, who was a foreman dyer in their employment, had for some years been entrusted by them with the purchase at market prices of the stuff which they used in the process of dyeing. Stubbs on behalf of his principals bought a lot of goods from Varley & Co who, as an inducement and reward for Stubbs` purchase orders, and without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, paid Stubbs large sums of money by way of commission. The commission was paid by an agreed formula. It was alleged that over a period of some nine years, Stubbs received bribes totalling about o5,541 with which Stubbs had bought land and other investments. A portion of the bribes was allegedly still held in cash. On discovering the receipt of bribes, the plaintiffs in the action sought to follow the bribes into the investments. In the action, they claimed, inter alia, for (1) the o5,541; (2) damages, and an inquiry as to the amount; (3) the necessary accounts; and (4) an inquiry as to what property and securities represented such bribes and proper conveyances and transfers thereof, and the appointment of a receiver thereof meanwhile. The plaintiffs then sought an interlocutory injunction to restrain Stubbs from dealing with the land in question and for an order directing him to bring the other investments and cash into court.
The matter was heard by Stirling J. The learned judge said the question before him was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to follow the bribes into the investments, that is, whether the plaintiffs had a proprietary or `tracing` claim to the investments. Counsel for plaintiffs relied on the case of 
 Morison v Thompson 
 30 and counsel for Stubbs submitted that the bribes were never the property of the plaintiffs and he relied on the authority of 
 Metropolitan Bank v Heiron 
 ,34 which was decided by the Court of Appeal of which Cotton LJ was a member. Learned counsel for Stubbs submitted to the learned judge that 
 Morison v Thompson 
 30 had nothing to do with the case. This submission was accepted by Stirling J. Mr Hunt says this was too narrow a view to take of 
 Morison v Thompson 
 .30 I shall return to these cases later. Stirling J held that the plaintiffs could not take the investments. He drew a distinction between money, if any, paid by the plaintiffs to Stubbs for a particular purpose and Stubbs misapplied it and the money which was paid by an outside third party. In the former case, the learned judge said that the plaintiffs` money left with Stubbs would have been clothed with a trust and they could have followed it into the investments in equity, following the famous rule laid down in 
 Taylor v Plumer 
 .45 In the latter case, the learned judge after considering both 
 Morison 
 30 and 
 Metropolitan Bank 
 34 came to the conclusion that the bribes from Varley & Co were held only as a debt, recoverable in an action for money had and received. He dismissed the motion for the injunction. The plaintiffs appealed. The appeal was heard on 3 May 1890 and two days later, the Court of Appeal (Cotton and Lindley LJJ) delivered judgment. The strong Court of Appeal affirmed the learned judge`s decision and decided that the relation between Stubbs and",1992-12-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

The writ of 
 habeas corpus ad subjiciendum 
 (`the writ`) is a prerogative writ issued by the courts to ensure the protection of the individual citizen`s right to personal freedom. The right is one that is recognized by the common law and, in Singapore, is guaranteed by art 9 of our Constitution. The writ enables the courts to test the legality of any detention of a citizen and its importance is such that no detention in the land is immune from having its legality tested by it. The importance of the writ carries with it the possibility of abuse and, accordingly, a distinction has historically been drawn between the writ of habeas corpus being a writ that issues as of right and other writs that issue as of course. This appeal concerned and turned upon that distinction.
This appeal was from the refusal by GP Selvam JC to issue the writ against the respondents in respect of the detention of the appellant under s 30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) (`the CLTPA`). The following facts appeared from the appellant`s affidavit in support of his application (`the appellant`s affidavit`). He joined the Prison Service in 1978 and served as a warder at various prisons, including Changi Prison from June or July 1985 until 2 December 1987. He was first arrested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`the CNB`) on 11 April 1988 and his family was informed by a letter dated 19 April from the CNB that he had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in drug trafficking activities. His detention by the CNB was stated to be for the purpose of facilitating investigations. His family sought legal advice and representations were made on his behalf by his solicitors. The representations alleged that his superior officers had been envious of his car and had colluded with several inmates to frame him. He was subsequently released on 28 April and a letter from the CNB to his family on the same day stated that he had been released unconditionally.
After his release, the appellant and his representatives complained to various authorities that his salary had been deducted during the period of his detention and that his special bonus had been withdrawn. Shortly after, on 5 July 1988, the appellant was rearrested for heroin trafficking and he has been in detention ever since. The appellant was informed of the reasons for his detention by a letter from the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs which stated: 
 
I am to inform you that you have been detained under s 30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act for your involvement in activities of a criminal nature, viz being a heroin trafficker operating at Changi Prison.
 
 
 
This letter was described incorrectly in the appellant`s affidavit as the detention order issued under s 30 of the CLTPA and it was so regarded by the appellant and his solicitors right up to the hearing in the court below.
Representations on behalf of the appellant were made in turn to the CNB, the Member of Parliament for his constituency and the Minister for Home Affairs. The representations repeated the earlier allegations of a frame-up. The Ministry of Home Affairs replied, informing the appellant`s family that the allegations had been investigated by the Criminal Investigation Department (`the CID`) and no frame-up had been found. The family was advised that representations should be made to the Criminal Law Advisory Committee (`the committee`) which would be examining the grounds for the appellant`s detention and making recommendations to the President. The appellant`s solicitors also wrote to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (`the CPIB`) repeating the allegations of a frame-up and asking them to carry out an independent investigation, but the CPIB declined to do so on the ground that the matter was not within their jurisdiction.
The committee met on 14 November 1988 and the appellant was legally represented at the hearing. The committee advised the confirmation of his detention and the President accepted this advice. The appellant was informed, somewhat belatedly, of this on 13 February 1989. His family continued to make representations on his behalf, on the same allegations, to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Home Affairs. The authorities replied, stating that his case would be considered at the committee`s review of his detention in May 1989. His family also wrote to the President again and the President`s office replied, stating that his allegations had already been investigated by the CID and found to be groundless. At the review in May 1989, the committee recommended the continued detention of the appellant.
The appellant`s family then hired private investigators to investigate the activities of former inmates of Changi Prison whom the appellant alleged had framed him. These were (1) Victor Peter Paul; (2) Balan s/o Vengdasalm; and (3) Raja. The appellant alleged that they were involved in drug trafficking activities in Changi Prison and had conspired with his superiors in order to avoid punishment for those activities. The private investigators` report dated 5 September 1990 showed: 
 
 
(1) Victor Peter Paul had told them that Balan s/o Vengdasalm had told him that he (Balan) had to pay the appellant $1,000 for the purchase of drugs; 
 
(2) Victor Peter Paul had no personal knowledge that the appellant was involved in drug trafficking; 
 
(3) after his release from prison, Victor Peter Paul was involved in drug trafficking at his place of work.
  
 
 
The report was sent by the appellant`s solicitors to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry replied on 24 December 1990, stating that they had looked into the matter and had found that the appellant`s allegations could not be substantiated. On 5 April 1991, the appellant`s solicitors wrote to the committee, repeating essentially the same allegations of a frame-up. The secretary to the committee replied, informing the appellant`s solicitors that the representations would be considered at the next review of the appellant`s detention by the committee.
In addition to the allegations of a frame-up, the appellant`s affidavit also gave the following reasons why the writ ought to be issued: 
 
 
(1) he had been unconditionally released on 28 April 1988 after the CNB had conducted some investigations; 
 
(2) he had been denied a trial when other warders arrested for similar activities had been tried in open court; and 
 
(3) there was no ground for suspecting him since he did not own any assets and did not have expensive habits. Moreover, he was a pious and religious man.
  
 
 
At the hearing below, counsel for the respondents supplied counsel for the appellant with a copy of the detention order issued pursuant to s 30 of the CLTPA. No objection was taken either at the hearing below or before us as to the propriety of the order.
The learned judicial commissioner held that the above facts adduced by the appellant failed to show any probable cause that his detention was unlawful. In his view, the contention that the appellant was innocent was irrelevant as the guilt or innocence of a detainee was not the concern of a judge hearing the application for the writ. The judge`s concern was with the legality of the detention and, in the learned judicial commissioner`s view, the documents annexed to the appellant`s affidavit in aid of his application contained substantial evidence to show that he was being lawfully detained. The learned judicial commissioner also summarily rejected the contention that the detention was unlawful because the appellant ought to have been charged under the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal
Before we explain our reasons for dismissing the appeal as we did at the end of the hearing of the appeal, we will deal with a preliminary point regarding the availability of an appeal in applications involving detentions of this nature. In the court below, there was no attempt to determine if this application was in the nature of a civil application or a criminal proceeding. However, the need to make such a determination arises in a critical way on appeal: if the application is a criminal proceeding there is no appeal, whereas there is an appeal if the application is a civil proceeding.
The dichotomy arises from the existence of two different procedures for making an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Article 9 of the Constitution provides, where material: 
 
 
(1) No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. 
 
(2) Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him.
  
 
 
The power to carry out the direction given by this article of the Constitution is expressly conferred by s 18(2)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`the SCJA`). The article does not, however, set out the procedure to be followed when invoking this power of the High Court. As the learned judicial commissioner correctly observed, applications in civil matters are to comply with O 54 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (`the RSC`) while applications in criminal matters are to comply with s 327 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). However, while there is no bar to an appeal from an application under O 54, s 335 of the CPC provides that there shall be no appeal from an order directing or refusing to direct the issue of the writ. If then this is a criminal matter, this court, whether sitting as the Court of Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal, would have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal as the appellate jurisdictions of the appellate courts as set out in ss 29 and 44 of the SCJA are subject to the provisions of any other written law regulating the terms and the conditions upon which appeals can be brought.
Was this application then a criminal or civil matter? The appellant treated this application as a civil matter in commencing it under O 54 of the RSC and the respondents made no objection. We think that this was correct. There is valuable guidance in this area from the decision of the English appellate courts which have had to wrestle with the phrase `criminal cause or matter` in s 18(1)(a) of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and its equivalent predecessor enactments. The leading authority is the House of Lords decision in 
 Amand v Home Secretary and Minister of Defence of Royal Netherlands Government 
 ,1 in which Viscount Simon LC opined, at p 156, that in determining if a matter is `criminal`: 
 
It is the nature and character of the proceeding in which habeas corpus is sought which provide the test. If the matter is one the direct outcome of which may be trial of the applicant and his possible punishment for an alleged offence by a court claiming jurisdiction to do so, the matter is criminal.
 
 
 
Lord Wright expressed his view as follows, at p 162: 
 
The principle which I deduce from the authorities I have cited and the other relevant authorities which I have considered, is that if the cause or matter is one which, if carried to its conclusion, might result in the conviction of the person charged and in a sentence of some punishment, such as imprisonment or fine, it is a `criminal cause or matter`. The person charged is thus put in jeopardy. Every order made in such a cause or matter by an English court, is an order in a criminal cause or matter, even though the order, taken by itself, is neutral in character and might equally have been made in a cause or matter which is not criminal. The order may not involve punishment by the law of this country, but if the effect of the order is to subject by means of the operation of English law the persons charged to the criminal jurisdiction of a foreign country, the order is, in the eyes of English law for the purposes being considered, an order in a criminal cause or matter ...
 
 
 
In the view of Lord Porter (see p 164): 
 
The proceeding ... must be a step in a criminal proceeding, but it need not itself of necessity end in a criminal trial or punishment. It is enough if it puts the person brought up before the magistrate in jeopardy of a criminal charge ...
 
 
 
We are of the view that the principles set down in 
 Amand v Home Secretary 
 1 should be applied in the present context of determining if an application for a writ of habeas corpus is civil or criminal in nature. Where, as in the present appeal, the allegedly unlawful detention is one under the CLTPA, the essential issue is whether such detention may lead to the trial and possible punishment of the detainee for an alleged offence.
Section 30 of the CLTPA provides: 
 
Whenever the Minister is satisfied with respect to any person, whether the person is at large or in custody, that the person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, the Minister may with the consent of the Public Prosecutor -
 
 
 
 
(a) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order, by order under his hand direct that the person be detained for any period not exceeding one year from the date of the order; or 
 
(b) if he is satisfied that it is necessary that the person be subject to the supervision of the police, by order direct that the person be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding 3 years from the date of the order.
  
 
 
Detention under the section is therefore dependent upon the satisfaction of the Minister for Home Affairs: (1) that the detainee has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, and (2) that it is necessary that the person be detained in the interests of public safety, peace and good order. The detention is therefore not punitive in the sense of being for the purpose of punishing a past act of the detainee, but preventive in the larger interests of society. This fundamental distinction between detention and imprisonment is well expressed in the judgment of Ray CJ giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in 
Haradhan Saha v The State of West Bengal & Ors
 
[1974] AIR SC 2754
 at p 2160: 
 
The power of preventive detention is qualitatively different from punitive detention. The power of preventive detention is a precautionary power exercised in reasonable anticipation. It may or may not relate to an offence. It is not a parallel proceeding. It does not overlap with prosecution even if it relies on certain facts for which prosecution may be launched or may have been launched. An order of preventive detention may be made before or during prosecution. An order of preventive detention may be made with or without prosecution and in anticipation or after discharge or even acquittal. The pendency of prosecution is no bar to an order of preventive detention. An order of preventive detention is also not a bar to prosecution. ... In a prosecution an accused is sought to be punished for a past act. In preventive detention, the past act is merely the material for inference about the future course of probable conduct on the part of the detenu.
 
 
 
Similar remarks were made by Dua J in giving the judgment of the same court in 
 Borjahan Gorey v The State of West Bengal 
 3 where the learned judge stated, at pp 2257-2258: 
 
Judicial trial for punishing the accused for the commission of an offence as also preventive security proceedings in a criminal court against a person merely for keeping the peace or for good behaviour under Ch VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure, we may appropriately point out, is a jurisdiction distinct from that of detention under the Act, which has in view the object of preventing the detenu from acting in any manner prejudicial, inter alia, to the security of the state or maintenance of public order. The fields of these two jurisdictions are not co-extensive nor are they alternative. The jurisdiction under the Act may be invoked when the available evidence does not come up to the standard of judicial proof but is otherwise cogent enough to give rise to suspicion in the mind of the authority concerned that there is a reasonable likelihood of repetition of past conduct which would be prejudicial, inter alia, to the security of the state or the maintenance of public order or even when the witnesses may be frightened or scared of coming to a court and deposing about past acts on which the opinion of the authority concerned is based. This jurisdiction is sometimes called the jurisdiction of suspicion founded on past incidents and depending on subjective satisfaction. The jurisdiction for trial or for preventive proceedings under Ch VIII, Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be successfully invoked in such a situation. In other words, a case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, whether punitive or preventive, depends on the proof of objective facts which have already taken place whereas a case under the Act providing for preventive detention depends on the subjective satisfaction of the authorities concerned of the likelihood of the person to be detained to act in future in a manner similar to the one seen from his past acts.
 
 
 
We digress briefly to note that Dua J`s remarks on the validity of detention being dependent on the subjective satisfaction of the authorities would not apply to a detention under the CLTPA in view of the decision in 
 Chng Suan Tze v The Minister of Home Affairs 
 
 & Ors and other appeals 
 .4
The distinction between proceedings under the CPC and preventive detention shows that detention under the CLTPA does not put the detainee in jeopardy of possible trial and punishment for an alleged offence. It is in this narrow sense that the detention is not a criminal cause or matter. In procedural matters, the antifor all practical purposes is between civil and criminal matters: per Lord Sumner in 
 Clifford and O`Sullivan 
 5 at p 586. As the CPC regulates only criminal proceedings under the substantive criminal law (see 
 Mallal`s Criminal Procedure 
 (4th Ed) at p 3 and 
 Manohar and Chitaley on The Code of Criminal Procedure 
 (8th Ed) Vol 1 at p 197), an application for a writ of habeas corpus in respect of detention under s 30 of the CLTPA must be brought under the civil procedure of the Supreme Court and accordingly, the restriction on appeals contained in s 335 of the CPC does not apply.
We are reinforced in our conclusion by the past practice of the courts of Singapore that have dealt with habeas corpus applications arising out of cases of preventive detention by the executive under the civil procedure of the courts: see eg 
 Lee Mau Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;6 
 Lau Lek Eng & Ors v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;7 
 Wee Toon Lip & Ors v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
 ;8 and 
 Chng Suan Tze v Minister of Home Affairs 
 .4 We are aware that the Malaysian courts have reached a different view in 
 Munusamy v Subramaniam & Ors 
 9 and 
 Osman bin Mat Isa & Ors v Superintendent of Prison, Alor Star & Anor 
 ,10 sub nom 
 Zainab bte Othman v Superintendent of Prison, Pulau Jerejak, Penang 
 11 on appeal.
In 
 Munusamy 
 ,9 it was held that an application for a writ of habeas corpus had to be brought under the Criminal Procedure Code as the power conferred by the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 on the High Court to issue such writs was to be exercised in accordance with any written law or rules of court relating to the same, and the Criminal Procedure Code was a written law governing the issue of the writs. The nature of the detention that was challenged in that case does not appear from the report. We would respectfully disagree with the reasoning in that decision if it purports to justify a rule that all applications for a writ of habeas corpus must be brought under the Criminal Procedure Code, as the reasoning ignores the question whether the application for the writ is in respect of a detention to which the Criminal Procedure Code does or does not apply. That question, as we have said, depends on the true nature of the detention and, if the detention is civil, then the Criminal Procedure Code, being a code limited to criminal proceedings, does not apply.
 Osman bin Mat Isa 
 10 concerned a detention under s 4(1) of the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 which allows for detentions by executive order: 
 
If the Minister is satisfied with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public order it is necessary that the person should be detained, or that it is necessary for the suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence that the person should be detained ...
 
 
 
The learned judge in that case decided the question of the nature of the detention as one of impression and the Indian authorities cited above were not considered. On appeal, the view of the learned judge was approved by the Federal Court again as a matter of impression and without the citation of authority. We would respectfully disagree with the conclusions of those learned judges and hold that applications for writs of 
 habeas corpus ad subjiciendum 
 in Singapore in respect of preventive detentions by executive order should be made under the civil procedure of our courts.
 Writ as of right
We now turn to the substantive issue involved in this appeal. It has been established since Wilmot J gave his opinion to the House of Lords of the English Parliament in 1758 (see 
 Opinion on The Writ of Habea 
s 
 Corpus 
 (1758) Wilm 77, 97 ER 29) that a writ of habeas corpus only issues on probable cause shown by affidavit. The point was again reiterated in 
Ex p Corke
 
[1954] 2 All ER 440
 The reason for the need for probable cause was expressed in the following language by Wilmot J (at p 36): 
 
The reasons of guarding the writ in this manner, I take to be these: there are many kinds of private restraint that are lawful. There was a much greater number formerly. The Reformation opened the doors of religious prisons; and the abolition of military tenures unfettered an unhappy class of men, called villeins, who lived in a state of captivity under their masters.
 
 
 
There are many kinds of restraint that exist at this day; some in the nature of punishments. In domestic government, which takes in the case of husbands, fathers, guardians, and masters, the law authorizes restraints, in order to enforce a performance of those natural, moral, and civil duties, which wives, children, wards, and apprentices, owe to their superiors, in their several relative capacities. These domestic governments could not subsist without such authorities; and therefore all states have endeavoured most anxiously, some in a greater degree, and others in a less degree, to preserve the greatest reverence for them.
The wisdom of our ancestors would not suffer this kind of authorities to be broken in upon wantonly, upon mere suggestion, and without seeing some reason for an interposition; because they saw it would have encouraged disobedience and rebellion in private families; and, at all events, must have abated that awe and respect which act so materially in the support of those authorities. They may be abused: if they are, the law says, let it be shewn, and the party shall have relief; but if he cannot shew they are abused, he is entitled to none. The legal presumption is certainly in favour of these authorities; the law will not presume they are unduly or irregularly executed.
But if these writs were to have issued without any case made, they must have issued indiscriminately, in the cases of lawful restraints, as well as unlawful ones; which would have been levelling all distinction between them, and have been subjecting the authority of fathers, husbands, guardians, and masters, to be canvassed and questioned in the same manner, and upon the same suggestions, as the extravagant outrages of persons acting without any authority at all.
It would have been proceeding upon an inversion of the legal presumption, and would thereby have destroyed all that order, discipline, and subordination in private families, which lead men into a habit of obedience, and dispose them early to obey the laws of their country. ...
There are many other lawful restraints besides those arising under the authorities I have mentioned: All persons who are in custody upon civil process, or under special authorities, created by Act of Parliament, proceeding `civiliter`, and not `criminaliter`, against the persons who are the objects of them:- Persons who are bailed, paupers in hospitals or workhouses, madmen under commissions of lunacy, or confined by parish officers, under the Vagrant Act of 17 Geo II are all under a lawful confinement.
If all these persons were to have had these writs of habeas corpus of course, without shewing any cause or foundation for granting them, it would have been suffering this great remedial mandatory writ to have been used as an instrument of vexation and oppression; it would have become a weapon in the hands of madmen, and of dissolute, profligate and licentious people, to harass and disturb persons acting under the powers which the law had given them. One most frightful instance occurs: the case of a crew performing quarantine. If this writ were to issue of course, it might bring back pestilence and death along with it.
The check upon the writ, by requiring a probable cause to be shewn before it issues, is only saying, `shew you want redress, and you shall have it`: and if a person cannot disclose such a case himself, as to shew he is aggrieved when he tells his own story, and is not opposed or contradicted by any body; it is decisive against his being in such a condition as to want relief.
We are of the view that the reasons continue to remain valid today and are as applicable to a case of preventive detention as they were to the examples cited by Wilmot J.
An application for a writ of habeas corpus is, on the other hand, different from an application for mandamus, prohibition or certiorari under O 53 of the RSC in the sense that the court has no discretion to refuse the writ once probable cause is shown. In 
 R v Governor of Pentonville Prison & Anor, ex p Azam 
 sub nom 
 Azam v Secretary of State for the Home Department 
 ,13 Lord Denning MR stated at p 32: 
 
... If a man can make a prima facie case that he is not an illegal entrant, he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus as of right: see 
 Greene v Home Secretary
 
[1942] AC 284
, 302 by Lord Wright. The court had no discretion to refuse it. Unlike certiorari or mandamus, a writ of habeas corpus is of right to every man who is unlawfully detained. If a prima facie case is shown that a man is unlawfully detained, it is for the one who detains him to make a return justifying it.
 
 
 
The same point was made in 
 Yeap Hock Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia 
 14 (at p 282). Any suggestion to the contrary in 
 Re Choo Jee Jeng 
 15 (at p 219) was clearly incorrect.
 The appellant`s affidavit
Before an examination of the facts disclosed by the appellant`s affidavit is embarked upon, it is necessary to have an overview of the relevant provisions of the CLTPA. Section 30, which has been set out above, provides that the Minister must be satisfied of two facts before he can, with the consent of the public prosecutor, order the detention of a person under the Act: the past association of the person with activities of a criminal nature, and that it is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order that he be detained. The order is to be reviewed by an advisory committee within 28 days and the committee reports to the President and makes such recommendations as it thinks fit: s 31(1). The President may then cancel or confirm the order (with or without variations): s 31(2). The detainee detained by the order of the Minister under s 30 may be detained for up to one year. Thereafter, his detention may be extended by the President for periods not exceeding one year at any one time.
The facts adduced by the appellant in his affidavit showed that all these provisions had been complied with. Further, no objection was made to the propor correctness of the detention order. It was clear from the facts adduced that the appellant`s assertions of innocence and of a frame-up had been fully examined by the CID. The private investigators` report had also been considered by the Ministry of Home Affairs. These facts, rather than showing probable cause in the appellant`s favour, indicated that the Minister, the President and the public prosecutor had some objective grounds for ordering the initial and continued detention of the appellant. Indeed, the facts adduced clearly undermined the application.
It was said that the bona fides of the detention was suspect because the appellant had been unconditionally released on 28 April 1988 after the CNB had conducted some investigations. We did not think that the point had any substance for it amounted to saying that an investigative body was bound by its preliminary view of a matter. This could not be correct. The CNB had not, in its letter of 28 April, stated that they had failed to find any evidence that the appellant was not involved in drug trafficking or given any particulars as to why he had been released.
Then it was said that it was not right that the appellant should be denied a trial when other warders arrested for drug trafficking had been charged in open court. This submission ignored the fundamental distinction between preventive detention and criminal proceedings which has been considered above. The authorities cited above show that it is no ground for complaint that a person is detained rather than charged in open court.
The appellant also relied on statements in his affidavit that he was a man of good character. The statements were mere assertions, however, and were not supported by any evidence. Accordingly, they were not of any assistance to his case.
It was for all the above reasons that we dismissed the appeal.

Whether defendants' mark 'CILLY' infringed plaintiffs' trade mark
 
The plaintiffs` claim against the defendants is for (1) infringement of their registered trade mark `hille` (pronounced as in `hilly`) No 50243 (the said trade mark) and (2) passing off the defendants` polypropylene chair shells as and for those of the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and have their registered office at 132 St Albans Road, Watford, Hertfordshire WD 24 AG, United Kingdom. The said trade mark was registered in Class 20, in respect of furniture and parts and fittings therefor, on 7 October 1970 and such registration is and has, at all material times, been valid and subsisting.
Since 1968 the plaintiffs have used the said trade mark extensively upon their polypropylene chair shells and their polypropylene chair shells so marked have come to be well known in the trade and to the public as those of the plaintiffs.
The defendants were incorporated in 1974 as a private limited company. They acquired and took over as a going concern the firm of Tiong Hin Engineering Works and continued to carry on the business of the said firm mainly manufacturing steel office furniture and household furniture. The defendants are the registered proprietors of the Trade Mark `Sunflag` and `DAGLO` which were registered in 1974 and 1977 respectively in Class 20, in respect of all types of furniture.
In 1975 the defendants became aware for the first time that the plaintiffs were selling polypropylene shells under the mark `hille`. (See interrogatory 8 and answer thereto.) In 1976 or thereabouts they decided to manufacture polypropylene shells but before this could be done a mould in the requisite shape had to be made. The chairman of the defendant company (DW1) happened to be in Taiwan in March 1977. There he saw, so his evidence goes, many such shells - the `hille` shell was not amongst those he saw. He examined these shells and bought one of them which, in his view, suited his requirements for manufacture in Singapore. At the same time he, although he knew no English, invented a trade mark in the English language, to wit, `CILLY` (pronounced as in `silly`.) He then ordered in Taiwan a mould to be made of the shell he had bought and with the word `CILLY` incorporated into the mould. His `CILLY` polypropylene shell manufactured from the said mould came on to the market in or about July 1977.
The plaintiffs say that, since the registration of their said trade mark and prior to the issue of the writ in this action on 27 February 1979, the defendants had infringed the plaintiffs` said trade mark `hille` by their using, in the course of trade in Singapore in relation to their polypropylene chair shells, the trade mark `CILLY` which look and sound so alike the said trade mark that it could lead to confusion or deception or a possibility of such confusion or deception.
The plaintiffs further say that such use of the mark `CILLY` by the defendants not only infringes their said trade mark but is also calculated to lead to deception and to the belief that the defendants` polypropylene chair shells are the polypropylene chair shells of the plaintiffs and is further calculated to cause and must have caused polypropylene chair shells not of the plaintiffs` manufacture or merchandise to be passed off as and for the polypropylene chair shells of the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs have thereby suffered damages and will suffer damage.
The defendants in their defence deny any infringement as claimed by the plaintiffs and say that:
 
 
(a) that they have not infringed the plaintiffs` trade mark; 
 
(b) that the said trade mark `hille` and the mark `CILLY` are visually and phonetically different; 
 
(c) that they have not passed off their polypropylene chair shells as those of the plaintiffs` and that there is no confusion or deception or a possibility of confusion or deception arising from the defendants` use of the trade mark `CILLY`, as the differences in the respective trade marks are sufficient to obviate any possibility of confusion or deception; 
 
(d) that their customers were not deceived or confused as a result of their use of the trade mark `CILLY`.
  
 
 
 
 
 Infringement of plaintiffs` registered trade mark `hille` 
 
 
 
To succeed in their claim that their said trade mark has been infringed by the defendants, the plaintiffs must prove that:
 
 
(1) they are the registered proprietors of the said trade mark; 
 
(2) the said trade mark has been registered in Class 20 in respect of furniture and parts and fittings therefor; 
 
(3) the said trade mark is and has at all material times been valid and subsisting; 
 
(4) the defendants have, since the registration of the said trade mark, and before the issue of the writ in this action, infringed the said trade mark by using in the course of trade in Singapore in relation to their polypropylene chair shells, the mark `CILLY` which so nearly resembles the said trade mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade.
  
 
 
The defendants by their defence do not dispute ingredients (1), (2) and (3) set out above. As to ingredient (4), they dispute it only to the extent that their mark `CILLY` does not so nearly resemble the said trade mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the trade.
The crucial question for decision is whether the mark `CILLY` so nearly resembles the plaintiffs` trade mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the trade. In this connection it is relevant to note that in the defendants` solicitors` reply dated 5 October 1978 in response to the plaintiffs` letter of complaint dated 11 September 1978 the following passage appears, `Our clients state that phonetically and visually their trade mark is completely different: it should be noted in this regard that our clients` mark `CILLY` is pronounced `silly` while your clients` mark `hille` is pronounced `hill`. An attempt was made during the trial by the defendants to maintain this position. However, towards the close of the defendants` case it was conceded by the managing director of the defendant company, (DW 2), that they knew that the said trade mark `hille` was known in the market as in `hilly` and not as in `hill`. So the question to be answered is whether the trade mark `hille` pronounced as in `hilly` and the trade mark `CILLY` pronounced as in `silly` so nearly resemble each other in sound as to be likely to deceive, or cause confusion in the trade. In this connection, one must keep in mind that not all customers in Singapore speak English or write English. This is an even more important factor in deciding such a question (see 
 White 
 
 Hudson & Co 
 
 v 
 
 Asian Organization Ltd 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 186 
) than it would have been had all customers in Singapore been English speaking. The chairman of the defendant company in his evidence gave a fanciful explanation of how he came to hit upon the word `CILLY` for his trade mark. I have no doubt that this fanciful explanation was invented by him for purposes of this trial. His bona fide is suspect for if he had just wanted a trade mark for his polypropylene shells he already had a registered trade mark, namely, `Sunflag` in March 1976, which he could have made use for his polypropylene shells. His bona fide is even more suspect when it is now known that after the issue of the writ the defendants had been using the mark `DAGLO` on the self-same shells that had previously carried the mark `CILLY`. I am satisfied that on the evidence before me that the defendants deliberately invented the word `CILLY` to deceive and cause confusion in the trade. The ultimate sound of the two words `hille` and `CILLY` when pronounced in speech are so similar that it is bound to deceive and cause confusion. The case nearest to the instant case which I have been able to find is that of the Court of Appeal case of 
 Fialho v 
 
 SD Simond & Co Ltd 
 (1937) 54 RPC 193. In this case `the plaintiffs, a Portuguese firm, who had carried on business by themselves and their predecessors since 1892, were importers, inter alia
 , 
 of tinned sardines into the United Kingdom. They were the registered proprietors of Trade Mark No 204985 registered in Class 42, consisting of the words ""Marie Elizabeth"" and a pictorial design, and of Trade Mark No 424307 also registered in Class 42 consisting of words ""Marie Elizabeth"" alone. The defendants sold a consignment of tinned sardines obtained from America and bearing the words ""Maria Lisette"", the whole of which had been sold prior to the action, and had also issued a circular offering ""Marie Lisette"" tins of sardines. Held, that the mark ""Marie Elizabeth"" and its abbreviation ""Maries"" indicated the plaintiffs` goods, and that the use of the mark ""Maria Lisette"" or ""Marie Lisette"" was an infringement of the trade marks and was calculated to pass off; and that, although the defendants no longer had any goods marked in this way in their possession, the plaintiffs were nevertheless entitled to an injunction. The usual other relief was granted.`
Towards the closing stage of his judgment Farwell J had this to say (p 198 lines 47 to 53): 
 
So far as the trade mark is concerned, the names are so closely connected and so much alike that it is extremely difficult to avoid the conclusion that there was some intention, on the part of those who selected them, to get the benefit, so far as it was possible, of the plaintiffs` goodwill. In my judgment there is in this case such a taking of the name of the plaintiffs as to lead to serious possibility of deception, and to amount to an infringement of both the trade marks.
 
 
 
With regard to the passing off of the defendants` goods as those of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs were suggesting that the shape and colour of the defendants` polypropylene shells were about the same or so close to one another that the defendants by a combination of shape, colour and the use of the word `CILLY` were passing off or attempting to pass off their goods as those of the plaintiffs. I am however, of the view that the colours and shapes used in the manufacture of polypropylene shells are common to the trade. I am sustained in this view by the fact that the plaintiffs are not pursuing by action the marketing by the defendants of the self-same polypropylene shells under their registered trade mark `DAGLO`.
There will be an injunction with regard to the mark `CILLY` as asked for in para 1 of the prayer`s of the statement of claim and an order in terms of prayers 3 and 4 thereof.
 Order accordingly.",1982-10-22 00:00:00,SG High Court
